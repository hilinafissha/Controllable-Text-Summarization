Its broadcasting properties would remain together with other assets in the Tribune Co.\n\nThe Tribune Co., which emerged from bankruptcy at the end of 2012, signaled last week that it was shifting its emphasis toward television when it purchased 19 stations in 16 markets, bringing its total number of television stations to 42 and giving the company a large footprint in the local TV business.\n\nAt the same time, the company has been exploring the sale of some or all of its newspapers. Initial efforts to sell have proceeded slowly, and a bidding process that was supposed to have begun by now has not. Speaking to investors after announcing the television acquisition last week, Peter Liguori, Tribune\u2019s chief executive, said the company was still considering all of its strategic options regarding the newspapers.\n\nOne potential holdup on a sale is the tax implications; given that the newspapers are mature businesses, the taxes on a sale of all the properties could reach well over $100 million.\n\nThe spinoff announced Wednesday does not preclude a sale of any of the papers, the company said, and executives are hoping the announcement stirs interest in some of the properties and perhaps a greater willingness to shoulder some of the tax implications.\n\nThe company has interests in large digital assets like CareerBuilder.com and Classified Ventures that include publishing arrangements with the newspapers that would have been invalidated by a sale. The broadcast entity, which will continue to be called the Tribune Co., will retain those assets, but the agreements will remain in place.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday, Liguori said each division would be able to operate independently. Each of the new entities will have its own board of directors and senior management team.\n\n\u201cThe two companies resulting from this transaction would each have revenues in excess of $1 billion and significant operating cash flow,\u201d Liguori said. \u201cWe expect that this transaction will serve our shareholders and employees well, and put these businesses in a strong position for continued success.\u201d\n\nThe split is expected to take months and is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nIn addition, Liguori has shown an increasing interest in the operational aspects of newspapers, indicating the company would probably not be selling them off wholesale.",

Carr appreciates the talent at his disposal in rookie Amari Cooper, and you have to love both of their chances against the Bears in Week 4.\n\nLance Dunbar, RB, Cowboys: PPR-leaguers looking for a reliable flex play should give Dunbar a hard look. He\u2019s filling a Darren Sproles-like role in the Cowboys\u2019 dink-and-dunk offense (with Brandon Weeden at quarterback), though he is rarely used as a runner. Look for similar stat lines to Sunday\u2019s 10-target, 10-reception, 100-yard performance \u2014 with the occasional TD, either receiving or returning kicks, added.\n\nRishard Matthews, WR, Dolphins: Despite the signing of free-agents Kenny Stills and Greg Jennings, and the first-round investment in DeVante Parker, Matthews has seized the No. 2 receiver role in Miami. In fact, he has more receiving yards (262) and TDs (3) than Jarvis Landry. Matthews shouldn\u2019t be overlooked any longer.\n\nKarlos Williams, RB, Bills: Unless you own LeSean McCoy and want him as a handcuff, don\u2019t go rushing out to acquire Williams. He got the bulk of his carries, including a 41-yard TD run, after Sunday\u2019s game was decided and the Bills chose to rest McCoy and his injured hamstring.\n\nReuben Randle, WR, Giants: Randle finally arrived Thursday night, but what took so long? He\u2019s playing opposite double-covered Odell Beckham, Jr., and Victor Cruz has yet to take the field in 2015. Randle\u2019s four receptions for 28 total yards over the first two games are more telling than his stellar output against Washington. Let someone else take the bait.\n\nFollow Ladd Biro online (fantasy-fools.blogspot.com), on Facebook and on Twitter (@ladd_biro).",

Thirty-two people had serious injuries, including at least seven who lost consciousness.\n\nPolice, fire and military rescue workers were planning to try to reach the area on foot after daybreak Sunday, after deciding that the ash in the air made it too dangerous to use helicopters.\n\nHanamura said seven people were reported missing on the mountain.\n\nLodge managers are familiar with first aid procedures and were communicating with rescue officials in town, he said.\n\nWith a sound likened to thunder, the volcano erupted shortly before noon on a clear autumn day, spewing large white plumes of gas and ash high into the sky and blanketing the surrounding area in ash.\n\nSmaller eruptions continued into the night. About 250 people were initially trapped on the slopes, but most had made their way down by Saturday night, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. Some were in shelters set up in four nearby towns.\n\nOne witness told NHK that the eruption started with large booms that sounded like thunder.\n\nIn a video posted on YouTube, shocked climbers can be seen moving quickly away from the peak as an expanding plume of ash emerges above and then engulfs them.\n\nMany of those who made it down emerged with clothes and backpacks covered in ash. They reported being engulfed in total darkness for several minutes.\n\nMikio Oguro, an NHK journalist who was on the slope on an unrelated assignment, told the station that he saw massive smoke coming out of the crater, blocking sunlight and reducing visibility to zero.\n\n\"Massive ash suddenly fell and the entire area was totally covered with ash,\" he said by phone. He and his crew had to use headlamps to find a lodge.\n\n\"My colleagues later told me that they thought they might die,\" Oguro said.\n\nTwo Jetstar flights headed to Tokyo's Narita International Airport diverted to Kansai International Airport in western Japan as a precaution.\n\nJapan's meteorological agency raised the alert level for Mount Ontake to 3 on a scale of 1 to 5. It warned people to stay away from the mountain, saying ash and other debris could fall up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away.\n\nMount Ontake, about 210 kilometers (130 miles) west of Tokyo, sits on the border of Nagano and Gifu prefectures, on the main Japanese island of Honshu.

Despite Miami\u2019s efforts to play down the importance of this December matchup between the East\u2019s top teams, it\u2019s evident LeBron James still wants to win the game. Following a Chalmers turnover with the Heat trailing, James exploded on the bench.\n\nThe moment LeBron launches himself toward Chalmers is mesmerizing.\n\nLater in the game, replays showed James talking to Chalmers on the bench, telling his point guard \u201cI was wrong, my bad.\u201d\n\n(Thanks to @gidsports for sharing this video.)",

There is presently no indication that the warning will be modified in light of the Harvard results (which did not consider caffeine intake from non-coffee sources, such as drugs).\n\nThe new data show no relationship between coffee intake and low birth weight, abnormally short pregnancies or birth defects in infants born to 12,205 women at Brigham and Women's Hospital from August 1977 through March 1980. But among the 2,652 women who admitted smoking three or more cigarettes a day throughout pregnancy, the incidence of low birth weight babies was 13 percent, as against 6 percent among nonsmokers. ''If a woman stopped smoking before or during pregnancy, this smoking effect disappeared,'' said one researcher, Dr. Kenneth J. Ryan, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School.",

      "document": "In our December 2018 report, we found that TSA provides pipeline operators with voluntary security guidelines that operators can implement to enhance the security of their pipeline facilities. TSA also evaluates the vulnerability of pipeline systems through security assessments. Pipeline operators and industry association representatives who we interviewed also reported exchanging risk-related security information and coordinating with federal and nonfederal entities, including TSA. However, we also identified weaknesses in several areas of TSA\u2019s pipeline security program management, including: (1) updating and clarifying pipeline security guidelines; (2) planning for workforce needs; (3) assessing pipeline risks; and (4) monitoring program performance. We found in our December 2018 report that all of the pipeline operators and industry association representatives that we interviewed reported receiving security information from federal and nonfederal entities. For example, DHS components including TSA\u2019s Intelligence and Analysis and NCCIC share security-related information on physical and cyber threats and incidents. Nonfederal entities included Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, fusion centers, industry associations, and subsector coordinating councils. Pipeline operators also reported that they share security-related information with TSA and the NCCIC. For example, TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines requests that pipeline operators report physical security incidents to the Transportation Security Operations Center (TSOC) and any actual or suspected cyberattacks to the NCCIC. According to TSA officials, TSOC staff analyzes incident information for national trends and common threats, and then shares their observations with pipeline operators during monthly and quarterly conference calls. In our December 2018 report, we found that the pipeline operators we interviewed reported using a range of guidelines and standards to address their physical and cybersecurity risks. For example, all 10 of the pipeline operators we interviewed stated they had implemented the voluntary 2011 TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines that the operators determined to be applicable to their operations. Five of the 10 pipeline operators characterized the guidelines as generally or somewhat effective in helping to secure their operations, 1 was neutral on their effectiveness, and 4 did not provide an assessment of the guidelines\u2019 effectiveness. Pipeline operators and industry association representatives reported that their members also use the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America\u2019s Control Systems Cyber Security Guidelines for the Natural Gas Pipeline Industry, the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s Pipeline SCADA Security standard, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework as sources of cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices that may be scaled and applied to address a pipeline operator\u2019s cybersecurity risks. We found that TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Branch had issued revised Pipeline Security Guidelines in March 2018, but TSA had not established a documented process to ensure that revisions occur and fully capture updates to supporting standards and guidance. The guidelines were revised to, among other things, reflect the dynamic threat environment and to incorporate cybersecurity principles and practices from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which was initially issued in February 2014. However, because NIST released version 1.1 of the Cybersecurity Framework in April 2018, the guidelines that TSA released in March 2018 did not incorporate cybersecurity elements that NIST added to the latest Cybersecurity Framework, such as the Supply Chain Risk Management category. Without a documented process defining how frequently TSA is to review and, if deemed necessary, revise its guidelines, TSA cannot ensure that the guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices of physical security and cybersecurity. We recommended that TSA implement a documented process for reviewing, and if deemed necessary, revising TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines at regular defined intervals. DHS agreed and estimated that this effort would be completed by April 30, 2019. In April 2019, TSA provided us with documentation outlining procedures for reviewing these guidelines. We are currently assessing this information to determine if it sufficiently addresses this recommendation. We also found that TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines lacked clarity in the definition of key terms used to determine critical facilities. TSA initially identifies the 100 highest risk pipeline systems based on the amount of material transported through the system. Subsequently, pipeline operators are to use criteria in the Guidelines to self-identify the critical facilities within those higher risk systems and report them to TSA. TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Branch then conducts CFSRs at the critical facilities identified by pipeline operators. However, our analysis of TSA\u2019s data found that at least 34 of the top 100 critical pipeline systems TSA deemed highest risk indicated that they had no critical facilities. Three of the 10 operators we interviewed stated that some companies that reported to TSA that they had no critical facilities may possibly be taking advantage of the guidelines\u2019 lack of clarity. For example, one of TSA\u2019s criteria for determining pipeline facility criticality states that if a facility or combination of facilities were damaged or destroyed, it would have the potential to \u201ccause mass casualties or significant health effects.\u201d Two operators told us that individual operators may interpret TSA\u2019s criterion, \u201ccause mass casualties or significant health effect,\u201d differently. For example, one of the operators that we interviewed stated that this criterion could be interpreted either as a specific number of people affected or a sufficient volume to overwhelm a local health department, which could vary depending on the locality. Without clearly defined criteria for determining pipeline facilities\u2019 criticality, TSA cannot ensure that pipeline operators are applying guidance uniformly, that all of the critical facilities across the pipeline sector have been identified, or that their vulnerabilities have been identified and addressed. We recommended that TSA\u2019s Security Policy and Industry Engagement\u2019s Surface Division clarify TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities. DHS agreed and estimated that this effort would be completed by June 30, 2019. TSA conducts pipeline security reviews\u2014CSRs and CFSRs\u2014to assess pipeline vulnerabilities and industry implementation of TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Guidelines. However, the number of reviews conducted has varied widely from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. These reviews are intended to develop TSA\u2019s knowledge of security planning and execution at critical pipeline systems and lead to recommendations for pipeline operators to help them enhance pipeline security. For an overview of the CSR and CFSR processes, see Figure 1 below. We found that the number of CSRs and CFSRs completed by TSA has varied during the last five fiscal years, ranging from zero CSRs conducted in fiscal year 2014 to 23 CSRs conducted in fiscal year 2018, as of July 31, 2018 (see Figure 2 below). TSA officials reported that staffing limitations had prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. TSA Pipeline Security Branch staffing levels (excluding contractor support) also varied significantly over the past 9 years ranging from 14 full-time equivalents in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to one in fiscal year 2014 (see Table 1 below). TSA officials stated that, while contractor support has assisted with conducting CFSRs, there were no contractor personnel providing CSR support from fiscal years 2010 through 2017, but that contractors increased to two personnel in fiscal year 2018. TSA officials stated that they expected to complete 20 CSRs and 60 CFSRs per fiscal year with Pipeline Security Branch employees and contract support, and had completed 23 CSRs through July 2018 for fiscal year 2018. In addition, pipeline operators that we interviewed emphasized the importance of cybersecurity skills among TSA staff. Specifically, 6 of the 10 pipeline operators and 3 of the 5 industry representatives we interviewed reported that the level of cybersecurity expertise among TSA staff and contractors may challenge the Pipeline Security Branch\u2019s ability to fully assess the cybersecurity portions of its security reviews. We found that TSA had not established a workforce plan for its Security Policy and Industry Engagement or its Pipeline Security Branch that identified staffing needs and skill sets such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise among TSA staff and contractors. We therefore recommended that TSA develop a strategic workforce plan for its Security Policy and Industry Engagement Surface Division, which could include determining the number of personnel necessary to meet the goals set for its Pipeline Security Branch, as well as the knowledge, skills, and abilities, including cybersecurity, that are needed to effectively conduct CSRs and CFSRs. DHS agreed and estimated that this effort would be completed by July 31, 2019. The Pipeline Security Branch has developed a risk assessment model that combines all three elements of risk\u2014threat, vulnerability, and consequence\u2014to generate a risk score for pipeline systems. The Pipeline Security Branch developed the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool in 2007 for use in assessing various security risks to the top 100 critical pipeline systems based on volume of material transported through the system (throughput). The risk ranking tool calculates threat, vulnerability, and consequence for each pipeline system on variables such as the amount of throughput in the pipeline system and the number of critical facilities using data collected from pipeline operators, as well as other federal agencies such as the Departments of Transportation and Defense. The ranking tool then generates a risk score for each of the 100 most critical pipeline systems and ranks them according to risk, which was information used by TSA to prioritize pipeline security assessments. However, in our December 2018 report we found that the last time the Pipeline Security Branch calculated relative risk among the top 100 critical pipeline systems using the ranking tool was in 2014. Since the risk assessment had not changed since 2014, information on threat may be outdated and may limit the usefulness of the ranking tool in allowing the Pipeline Security Branch to effectively prioritize reviews of pipeline systems. We recommended that the Security Policy and Industry Engagement\u2019s Surface Division update the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool to include up-to-date data to ensure it reflects industry conditions, including throughput and threat data. DHS agreed and in March 2019 TSA officials reported taking steps to update the data in the Pipeline Risk Ranking Tool to reflect current pipeline industry data. We are currently reviewing those actions to determine if they sufficiently address our recommendation. We also found that some of the sources of data and vulnerability assessment inputs to the ranking tool were not fully documented. For example, threats to cybersecurity were not specifically accounted for in the description of the risk assessment methodology, making it unclear if cybersecurity threats were part of the assessment\u2019s threat factor. We recommended that the Security Policy and Industry Engagement\u2019s Surface Division fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions, and judgments that form the basis of the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool, including sources of uncertainty and any implications for interpreting the results from the assessment. In March 2019, TSA officials stated that they had taken steps to document this information. We are currently reviewing those steps to determine if they sufficiently address our recommendation. In our December 2018 report, we also found that TSA developed three databases to track CSR and CFSR recommendations and their implementation status by pipeline facility, system, operator, and product type. TSA officials stated that the primary means for assessing the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s efforts to reduce pipeline security risks was through conducting pipeline security reviews\u2014CSRs and CFSRs. However, while TSA does track CFSR recommendations, we found that TSA had not tracked the status of CSR recommendations for security improvements in over 5 years\u2014information necessary for TSA to effectively monitor pipeline operators\u2019 progress in improving their security posture. We recommended that TSA take steps to enter information on CSR recommendations and monitor and record their status. DHS agreed and estimated that this effort would be completed by November 30, 2019.

      "summary": "More than 2.7 million miles of pipeline transport and distribute natural gas, oil, and other hazardous products throughout the United States. Interstate pipelines run through remote areas and highly populated urban areas, and are vulnerable to accidents, operating errors, and malicious physical and cyber-based attack or intrusion. Pipeline system disruptions could result in commodity price increases or widespread energy shortages. Several federal and private entities have roles in pipeline security. TSA is primarily responsible for the federal oversight of pipeline physical security and cybersecurity. This statement summarizes previous GAO findings related to TSA's management of its pipeline security program. It is based on a prior GAO product issued in December 2018, along with updates as of April 2019 on actions TSA has taken to address GAO's recommendations from the report. To conduct the prior work, GAO analyzed TSA documents, such as its Pipeline Security Guidelines ; evaluated TSA pipeline risk assessment efforts; and interviewed TSA officials, 10 U.S. pipeline operators\u2014a non-generalizable sample selected based on volume, geography, and material transported\u2014and representatives from five pipeline industry associations. GAO also reviewed information on TSA's actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has developed and provided pipeline operators with voluntary security guidelines, and also evaluates the vulnerability of pipeline systems through security assessments. However, GAO's prior work, reported in December 2018, identified some weaknesses and made recommendations to strengthen TSA's management of key aspects of its pipeline security program. Pipeline security guidelines . GAO reported that TSA revised its voluntary pipeline security guidelines in March 2018 to reflect changes in the threat environment and incorporate most of the principles and practices from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. However, TSA's revisions do not include all elements of the current NIST framework and TSA does not have a documented process for reviewing and revising its guidelines on a regular basis. GAO recommended that TSA implement a documented process for reviewing and revising TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines at defined intervals. TSA has since outlined procedures for reviewing its guidelines, which GAO is reviewing to determine if they sufficiently address the recommendation. Workforce planning . GAO reported that the number of TSA security reviews of pipeline systems has varied considerably over time. TSA officials stated that staffing limitations within its Pipeline Security Branch have prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. Staffing levels for the branch have varied significantly, ranging from 1 full-time equivalent in 2014 to 6 from fiscal years 2015 through 2018. Further, TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies\u2014such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise\u2014necessary to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. GAO recommended that TSA develop a strategic workforce plan, which TSA plans to complete by July 2019. Pipeline risk assessments . GAO identified factors that likely limit the usefulness of TSA's risk assessment methodology for prioritizing pipeline security reviews. For example, TSA has not updated its risk assessment methodology since 2014 to reflect current threats to the pipeline industry. Further, its sources of data and underlying assumptions and judgments regarding certain threat and vulnerability inputs are not fully documented. GAO recommended that TSA update its risk ranking tool to include up-to-date data to ensure it reflects industry conditions and fully document the data sources, assumptions and judgments that form the basis of the tool. As of April 2019, TSA reported taking steps to address these recommendations. GAO is reviewing documentation of these steps to determine if they sufficiently address the recommendations. Monitoring performance . GAO reported that conducting security reviews was the primary means for TSA to assess the effectiveness of its efforts to reduce pipeline security risks. However, TSA has not tracked the status of key security review recommendations for the past 5 years. GAO recommended that TSA take steps to update information on security review recommendations and monitor and record their status, which TSA plans to address by November 2019 GAO made 10 recommendations in its December 2018 report to strengthen TSA's management of its pipeline security program. DHS agreed and has described planned actions or timeframes for addressing these recommendations.",

When any of my children purchase a home, I waive my commission. My daughter knew I had been trying to finance a trip to South America for my husband so he could complete his \u201cbucket list.\u201d She gave me a cruise on one of the most expensive cruise lines and airfare to South America as a gift for helping with their home purchase. After my husband reviewed the itinerary, he said it wasn\u2019t the trip he had in mind and wanted to know if my daughter could change it. I was embarrassed to ask her after receiving such a gracious gift. He became indignant and said if she really wanted to give him something he wanted, she wouldn\u2019t mind changing the trip. I told Stacy I couldn\u2019t accept her gift because it was too much money. My husband is now angry with me because he feels I am the person at fault for the loss of the trip. Is my husband right that we should request a gift exchange from the giver, or was I justified for not accepting it in light of the fact that it was too much money?\n\nDear Just Wants Peace: Your husband sounds like a handful. He was at fault. Your mistake was allowing him to put you in the middle. I\u2019m sorry you fibbed to your daughter about why you refused her generosity, because the expense had nothing to do with it. Your husband\u2019s ingratitude had everything to do with it. Because the cruise didn\u2019t suit him, he should have spoken to her and asked if the itinerary could be adjusted. That way nothing could have been lost in translation, and he might have gotten his wish.\n\nDear Abby: During World War II, while I was overseas in the Navy, I received a \u201cDear John\u201d letter. It was devastating, especially because I was so far away and unable to immediately respond. Do you think it is appropriate for a person to send such a letter while the person is far away, especially while in the service, or should the person wait until the service member returns home and say it\u2019s over face-to-face? After all these years, I have heard many pros and cons about this question. I can think of no one else with such a wealth of knowledge in this area to ask but you. After hearing from you, I will finally put this to rest.\n\nDear John: A decade ago I would have said \u2014 and did tell someone \u2014 to wait until the person came home. My thinking was the news might demoralize the recipient and distract the person enough to get her/him killed. I changed my mind after hearing from service members stationed in the Middle East who told me I was wrong \u2014 that it\u2019s better to get the word while there were buddies close by who could be emotionally supportive. They suggested that if the service member hears the news when he gets back \u2014 alone and possibly traumatized by what he or she has been through \u2014 that it could make the person more vulnerable to suicide.",

After my husband reviewed the itinerary, he said it wasn\u2019t the trip he had in mind and wanted to know if my daughter could change it.  Is my husband right that we should request a gift exchange from the giver, or was I justified for not accepting it in light of the fact that it was too much money?

      "summary": "Requires the Attorney General to publicly disclose, in a&nbsp;manner consistent with national security,&nbsp;any decision of a court established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) that surveillance activities conducted by the U.S. government have violated a particular U.S. law or constitutional provision. Requires the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to provide information on surveillance activities to Congress, including information regarding: (1) whether the National Security Agency (NSA) or any other element of the intelligence community has ever collected, or made plans to collect, the cell-site location information of a large number of U.S. persons with no known connection to suspicious activity; (2) the type and amount of evidence the DNI believes is required to permit the collection&nbsp;of cell-site information for intelligence purposes; (3) whether NSA or any other element of the intelligence community has ever conducted a warrantless search of a collection of communications in an effort to find the communications of a particular U.S. person (other than a corporation) and, if so, the number of such searches or an estimate of such number; (4) when the U.S. government first began relying on authorities under FISA to justify the collection of records with no known connection to suspicious activity; (5) whether representations made to the U.S. Supreme Court by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the case of Clapper v. Amnesty International USA accurately described the use of authorities under FISA by the government, which of such representations, if any, were inaccurate, and how such representations have been corrected; and (6) FISA court opinions that identified violations of the law, the Constitution, or FISA court orders relating to the collection of information under FISA. Directs the Comptroller General (GAO), in consultation with the U.S. International Trade Commission, to conduct an assessment of the economic impact, including the impact on the ability of U.S. communication service providers to compete in foreign markets, of bulk collection and surveillance programs conducted under FISA, and to report to Congress on such assessment.

      "document": "State had 22,806 full-time, permanent, career employees at the end of fiscal year 2018\u2014an increase of more than 38 percent from fiscal year 2002. Over this period, the number of full-time, permanent, career employees in State\u2019s Civil Service rose by nearly 40 percent, from 6,831 in fiscal year 2002 to 9,546 in fiscal year 2018. Over the same period, the number of full-time, permanent, career employees in State\u2019s Foreign Service increased by 36 percent, from 9,739 to 13,260. To increase diversity in its workforce, State carries out a variety of efforts focused on recruiting and retention. For example, the Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship Program and Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Program recruit diverse candidates for the Foreign Service by providing graduate fellowships to college seniors and college graduates. Additionally, according to State officials, recruiters for the department participate in career fairs and discussion panels and host information sessions at conferences with a focus on diversity and inclusion, such as those held by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. Some regional and functional bureaus also undertake efforts to increase diversity. According to State\u2019s Senior Advisor for Diversity, Inclusion, and Outreach, bureau leaders set the tone, and provide support for bureau- level initiatives. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s (EEOC) Management Directive 715 (MD-715) provides policy guidance and standards for establishing and maintaining effective affirmative programs of equal employment opportunity. Through MD-715, EEOC directs federal agencies to regularly evaluate their employment practices to identify barriers to equal opportunity in the workplace, take measures to eliminate identified barriers, and report annually on these efforts to EEOC. Among State\u2019s full-time, permanent, career employees, the proportion of racial or ethnic minorities grew from 28 percent in fiscal year 2002 to 32 percent in fiscal year 2018. During this period, as figure 1 shows, the proportion of racial or ethnic minorities in the Civil Service decreased slightly, from 44 to 43 percent, and the proportion of racial or ethnic minorities in the Foreign Service increased from 17 to 24 percent. Although the overall proportion of racial or ethnic minorities at State increased from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2018, the direction of change for specific racial or ethnic minority groups varied, as shown in figure 1. The proportion of African Americans at State overall declined from 17 percent in fiscal year 2002 to 15 percent in fiscal year 2018. The proportion of African Americans in State\u2019s Civil Service decreased from 34 to 26 percent, while the proportion of African Americans in State\u2019s Foreign Service increased from 6 to 7 percent. The proportions of Hispanics, Asians, and other racial or ethnic minorities at State overall and in both the Civil and Foreign Services increased by varying percentages from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2018. As figure 2 shows, the proportions of racial or ethnic minorities in the Civil and Foreign Services were generally much smaller in higher ranks in fiscal year 2018. The proportion of racial or ethnic minorities in fiscal year 2018 was lower than the proportion of whites at GS-11, GS-13, and higher ranks in the Civil Service and at all ranks in the Foreign Service. The proportion of racial or ethnic minorities in fiscal year 2018 was progressively lower in each rank above GS-12 in the Civil Service and above Class 5 in the Foreign Service. Among State\u2019s full-time, permanent, career employees, the overall proportion of women at State decreased slightly, from 44 percent in fiscal year 2002 to 43 percent in fiscal year 2018. During this period, as figure 3 shows, the proportion of women in State\u2019s Civil Service decreased from 61 to 54 percent and the proportion of women in State\u2019s Foreign Service increased from 33 to 35 percent. In addition, the proportion of women at State was generally lower than that of men in the higher ranks of both the Civil and Foreign Services in fiscal year 2018, as figure 4 shows. The proportion of women was lower than the proportion of men at GS- 14 and higher ranks in the Civil Service and at Class 4 and higher ranks in the Foreign Service in fiscal year 2018. For example, the proportion of women at Class 4 was 36 percent, while the proportion of men was 64 percent. The proportion of women in the Civil and Foreign Services in fiscal year 2018 was generally progressively smaller from the lower to the higher ranks. Our analyses of State data for fiscal years 2002 through 2018 found differences between promotion outcomes for racial or ethnic minorities relative to whites and for women relative to men. We found these differences when conducting descriptive analyses, which calculated simple averages, as well as adjusted analyses, which controlled for certain individual and occupational factors other than racial or ethnic minority status and gender that could influence promotion. Our analyses do not completely explain the reasons for differences in promotion outcomes, which may result from various unobservable factors. Thus, our analyses do not establish a causal relationship between demographic characteristics and promotion outcomes. The following are some highlights of our analysis. Promotion outcomes in State\u2019s Civil Service were generally lower for racial or ethnic minorities than for whites. Our descriptive analysis of State data for fiscal years 2002 through 2018 found that rates of promotion from GS-11 through the executive rank were 16.1 to 42.0 percent lower for racial or ethnic minorities in the Civil Service than for their white counterparts, depending on the GS level. Our adjusted analysis, controlling for factors other than race or ethnicity that could influence promotion, found that racial or ethnic minorities in the Civil Service were 4.3 to 29.3 percent less likely to be promoted from GS-11 through the executive rank than their white counterparts. Promotion rates in State\u2019s Foreign Service were generally lower for racial or ethnic minorities than for whites, but the differences in promotion odds were generally not statistically significant. Our descriptive analysis of State data for fiscal years 2002 through 2018 found that, relative to whites, the rate of promotion for racial or ethnic minorities in the Foreign Service was 5.0 to 15.8 percent lower for promotions from Class 4 through Class 1. Controlling for factors other than race or ethnicity that could influence promotion, our adjusted analysis found that differences in the odds of promotion for racial or ethnic minorities and whites were generally not statistically significant. However, the odds of promotion from Class 4 to Class 3 were statistically significantly lower for racial or ethnic minorities than for their white counterparts. Promotion rates were generally lower for women than men in State\u2019s Civil Service, but differences in the odds of promotion were not statistically significant. Our descriptive analysis of State data for fiscal years 2002 through 2018 found that the rate of promotion in the Civil Service was generally lower for women than for men. Specifically, for promotions from GS-11 through the executive rank, promotion rates for women were generally 0.7 to 11.6 percent lower than the promotion rates for men, depending on the GS level. However, our adjusted analysis, controlling for factors other than gender that could influence promotion, did not find any statistically significant differences in the odds of promotion for women and men in the Civil Service. Our adjusted analysis found that the odds of promotion were generally higher for women than men in State\u2019s Foreign Service. Our descriptive analysis of State data for fiscal years 2002 through 2018 found that women in the Foreign Service experienced a higher rate of promotion than men from Class 3 to Class 2 and from Class 2 to Class 1. Our adjusted analysis, controlling for factors other than gender that could influence promotion, found that women in the Foreign Service had higher odds of promotion than men in early to mid career. For example, the odds of promotion from Class 4 to Class 3 were 9.4 percent higher for women than for men. State has identified some diversity issues in its reports to EEOC. As table 1 shows, in fiscal years 2009 through 2018, State\u2019s annual MD-715 reports identified and analyzed a total of 11 diversity issues related to participation of racial or ethnic minorities and women. State identified most of these issues in multiple years. However, State employee groups and our analysis have identified additional diversity issues, such as differences in promotion outcomes for racial or ethnic minorities relative to whites in early to mid career. For example, during our structured interviews with 11 employee groups, representatives of the groups discussed a variety of issues related to diversity at State. Examples include the following: Employee group representatives expressed concern about representation of minorities in the higher ranks of both the Civil and Foreign Services. For example, representatives told us that for some minority groups, it is difficult to be promoted above the GS-13 level. Employee group representatives voiced perceptions that it takes longer for women and racial or ethnic minorities to be promoted. For example, representatives of one group told us that it takes longer for employees with diverse backgrounds to reach GS-13 in the Civil Service and Class 2 in the Foreign Service and that very few of these employees are promoted beyond those levels. We recommended that the Secretary of State take additional steps to identify diversity issues that could indicate potential barriers to equal opportunity in its workforce. For example, State could conduct additional analyses of workforce data and of employee groups\u2019 feedback. State concurred with the recommendation and noted that the agency will continue to work on initiatives to recruit, retain, develop, and empower a diverse, capable workforce. In conclusion, although State has implemented several plans, activities, and initiatives to improve diversity and representation throughout the ranks of its workforce, longstanding diversity issues\u2014for example, underrepresentation of racial or ethnic minorities and women in the senior ranks\u2014persist at the agency. Until State takes steps to explore such issues, it could be missing opportunities to investigate, identify, and remove barriers that impede members of some demographic groups from realizing their full potential.

      "summary": "State has expressed a commitment to maintaining a diverse workforce and has undertaken efforts to increase diversity in its Civil and Foreign Services. EEOC directs federal agencies to regularly evaluate their employment practices to identify barriers to equal opportunity, take measures to eliminate any barriers, and report annually on these efforts. This testimony examines (1) the demographic composition of State's workforce in fiscal years 2002 through 2018; (2) any differences in promotion outcomes for various demographic groups in State's workforce; and (3) the extent to which State has identified any barriers to diversity in its workforce. For the January 2020 report on which this testimony is based (GAO-20-237), GAO analyzed State's data for its full-time, permanent, career workforce in fiscal years 2002 through 2018. GAO also analyzed the number of years until promotion from early career ranks to the executive rank in both the Civil and Foreign Services. (GAO's analyses do not completely explain the reasons for differences in promotion outcomes, which may result from various unobservable factors. Thus, GAO's analyses do not establish a causal relationship between demographic characteristics and promotion outcomes.) In addition, GAO reviewed State documents and interviewed State officials and employee group representatives. The overall proportion of racial or ethnic minorities in the Department of State's (State) full-time, permanent, career workforce grew from 28 to 32 percent from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2018. The direction of change for specific groups varied. For instance, the proportion of African Americans fell from 17 to 15 percent, while the proportions of Hispanics, Asians, and other racial or ethnic minorities rose by varying percentages. The proportion of racial or ethnic minorities and women was lowest in the higher ranks of State's workforce. GAO's analyses of State data for fiscal years 2002 through 2018 found differences in promotion outcomes for racial or ethnic minorities and whites and for men and women. GAO found these differences in both descriptive analyses (calculating simple averages) and adjusted analyses (controlling for certain individual and occupational factors that could influence promotion). For example, GAO's descriptive analysis of data for State's Civil Service found that rates of promotion for racial or ethnic minorities were 16 to 42 percent lower, depending on the rank, than for whites. Similarly, after controling for certain additional factors, GAO's adjusted analysis of these data found that promotion for racial or ethnic minorites was 4 to 29 percent less likely than for whites. Also, both types of analysis generally found that promotion outcomes for women relative to men were lower in the Civil Service and higher in the Foreign Service. For example, women in the Foreign Service were more likely than men to be promoted in early to mid career. State has identified some diversity issues, but it should consider other issues that could indicate potential barriers to diversity in its workforce. State's annual reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for fiscal years 2009 through 2018 identified issues such as underrepresentation of Hispanic employees and underrepresentation of minorities in the senior ranks. However, GAO's analysis and GAO's interviews with State employee groups highlighted additional issues that could indicate barriers to diversity. For example, State's reports have not identified lower promotion outcomes for racial or ethnic minorities relative to whites, which GAO found in its analysis. Until State takes steps to explore such issues, it could be missing opportunities to investigate and remove barriers that impede members of some demographic groups from realizing their full potential. In its January 2020 report, GAO recommended that State take additional steps to identify diversity issues that could indicate potential barriers to equal opportunity in its workforce. State concurred with this recommendation.",

inflammatory response syndrome . \n in contrast to this long - held view , marchant and colleagues and our group have observed that production of the immunosuppressive cytokine il-10 occurs from the very first hours following the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock , and that it is directly associated with the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines [ 7 -

Musically, Barberini (pictured) is best known as a prominent patron of opera just as opera was being invented \u2014 historically, as Galileo Galilei\u2019s defender during the astronomer\u2019s Vatican trial for heresy. But Barberini\u2019s deftest accomplishment was surviving Roman Catholic politics, which, at the time, were, to describe it ecumenically, Byzantine.\n\nFrancesco\u2019s position was nepotistic: Pope Urban VIII was his uncle. After Urban\u2019s death, the Barberini family attempted a coalition with their longtime rivals, the Pamphili, supporting the election of Pope Innocent X \u2014 who nonetheless dissolved the truce, hounding his old enemies. Urban VIII had pursued a war against the duchy of Castro. After initial gains (which, characteristically, were celebrated with a Barberini-commissioned opera, Marco Marazzoli\u2019s 1642 \u201cLe pretensioni del Tebro e del Po\u201d), the conflict ended in embarrassing defeat. Innocent X persecuted the Barberini into exile over the war\u2019s financial irregularities, then he refought it, literally leveling Castro to the ground.\n\nBut, as Innocent X\u2019s health declined, Olimpia Maidalchini \u2014 the pope\u2019s sister-in-law, his most influential advisor \u2014 married her daughter to Francesco Barberini\u2019s nephew, uniting the families in, effectively, an alliance against each other. When the new pope, Alexander VII, sought to strip Maidalchini of her status, Barberini attempted (unsuccessfully) to intercede. According to Gregorio Leti\u2019s scurrilous but irresistibly gossipy 1667 \u201cVita\u201d of Maidalchini, Cardinal Federico Sforza, disgusted by Barberini\u2019s intercessions, called him \u201cun gran diavolo.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Barberini maintained his ecclesiastic power; at his death in 1679, he was dean of the College of Cardinals, and still head of the Roman Inquisition, the job which, early on, had pitted Barberini against his own uncle over Galileo\u2019s science. That Galileo was allowed house arrest rather than prison was largely due to Barberini. \u201cI have always taken special note,\u201d Galileo wrote, \u201cof how affectionately Your Eminence has empathized with me.\u201d\n\nIn Stile Moderno performs Tuesday, St. Peter\u2019s Church, Weston; Wednesday, The Chapel at West Parish, Andover; Thursday at Emmanuel Church, Boston.

      "document": "There were countless highs for 49ers quarterback Steve Young, including the incredible crowd-raising touchdown run against the Minnesota Vikings in 1988, the MVP award for the 1992 season, the magical 1994 season capped by a record six touchdown passes in Super Bowl XXIX, and the Hail Mary passes to wide receiver Jerry Rice.\n\nThere were also the lows, the years of playing in Joe Montana's shadow, the seasons of being booed by fans, and the hits - including the Sept. 27, 1999, hit by the Arizona Cardinals' Aeneas Williams that left Young flat on the field and ended a storied career.\n\nYoung, 48, inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005, now lives on the Peninsula with his wife and four children, dividing his time between working as a commentator for ESPN and doing private-equity work in Palo Alto. He also runs a foundation to help disadvantaged children.\n\nIn the weeks before this year's Super Bowl, we spoke with Young at Candlestick Park, where he was commentating with Jerry Rice. Rice said Young's talent came from \"the way he conducted himself in the huddle. He had this look in his eyes. You could feel how competitive he was.\"\n\nYoung talked about concussions, life after football and the beauty of fatherhood.\n\nQ:How is it being here at the 'Stick?\n\nA: I love it. There is a smell at Candlestick. A very unique smell. There are the sounds of Candlestick. You can close your eyes and immediately know where you are. The sounds are cavernous. There are a lot of echoes. This is where those moments, those important moments of my life, happened under pressure. I know this place very well.\n\nQ:What one thing comes to mind when you think about football?\n\nA: The great thing about football is that it's a game that involves so many people. It's an amazing collection of people who have to be in the zone. That's the nature of the game. That's the beauty of football. If sports has anything to do for society, football plays a great role.\n\nQ:You were naturally gifted as a young athlete, serving as captain of your high school baseball, football and basketball teams. What made you choose football?\n\nA: I started when I was 8. I played kick the can. I played in a town league. I was very naturally fast. So this gave me a platform to use that. I think I always wanted to be quarterback so I could call the play.\n\nQ:Football is also an exceptionally dangerous game, and the NFL has finally started looking at the long-term effects of concussions on professional football players. You were said to have more than a dozen concussions, including the one that ended your career.\n\nA: I actually had a lot of vanilla ones. You rest for a couple of days and you feel better, with no side effects. I have friends who suffered a lot of bad things, who lost their sense of taste, who are going through some terrible things. It's a nefarious little injury because it's hard to know when you're ready to play again. There are so many gradations of concussions. It puts everyone in a tough spot.\n\nQ:Is the NFL doing enough to protect players?\n\nA: It's impossible to do enough to protect players because of the nature of the game. My opinion is that you need what I call a bright line. You need seven days of rest. Period. You get a concussion, and it's set that you will have one week before you play again. Even minor ones, you need to be out for seven days.\n\nQ:What do you think of the NFL's plan to have independent brain-injury experts determine when a player can return to the field?\n\nA: I think it's very difficult to have a third party. I don't see it working. Again, I say take them out for one week.\n\nQ:How is life after football?\n\nA: It's been 10 years now. It's a young man's game physically. I encourage players who retire to recognize that it's over. I tell them that you will not find the adrenaline of playing the game ever again. You simply have to let it go. You can't re-create it. If you are trying to re-create it, you are chasing a ghost.\n\nQ:So where do your rewards come from now?\n\nA: Life with my family (he married Barbara Graham on March 15, 2000) is sublime and just as engaging - but different. I am proof that your life can actually be better and more rewarding. We have two boys and two girls, ages 9, 6, 3 and 1.\n\nQ:Are you a hands-on dad?\n\nA: (Laughs) I'm in the middle of the child rearing. I'm the diaper man. I can do this diaper move in a restaurant bathroom that is pretty impressive. I do the whole diaper change without a changing table. I lean against a wall, crouch, make a lap for the baby, and change the diaper. No spills, no problem. People will walk in, make note of the technique, and then do a double take wondering, \"Is that Steve Young?\"\n\nA: A couple of years ago my wife was going to her 20-year reunion. She said, 'I need some eye candy. So get in shape. You're going to a personal trainer.' So I started to go. I love it. I jog on my own. I go to a gym. My trainer does all the core stuff and pushes me and generally makes life miserable for me. But I feel like I'm in better shape today than I have been in a long time. And the kids keep me young and fit.\n\nQ:Do your kids play football?\n\nA: I'm really a flag football guy until kids get into junior high. I don't find it helpful to see a 9-year-old overcompeting.\n\nQ:Any other hobbies? Cars? Planes? Boats?\n\nA: I am a huge \"stuff\" guy. I have a lot of stuff that doesn't matter. The only toy I have that matters to me is a 1987 Porsche Carrera. My wife thinks it's a piece of crap. It's blue but you can't tell it's blue. That's my toy.\n\nA: I wish I could've met my wife earlier. I do the math and I want 30 more years. I wish I'd started having kids earlier.\n\nQ:Books on your bedside table?\n\nA: (Laughs) I'm reading a nursing mother's book. It goes into the environment, ecology and the safety of products. My wife said, \"You have to read it for the safety of children,\" so I'm reading it. But it's right next to my Sports Illustrated.",
      "summary": "Steve Young still calls plays - for his kids  There were countless highs for 49ers quarterback Steve Young, including the incredible crowd-raising touchdown run against the Minnesota Vikings in 1988, the MVP award for the 1992 season, the magical 1994 season capped by a record six touchdown passes in Super Bowl XXIX, and the Hail Mary passes to wide receiver Jerry Rice.  There were also the lows, the years of playing in Joe Montana's shadow, the seasons of being booed by fans, and the hits - including the Sept. 27, 1999, hit by the Arizona Cardinals' Aeneas Williams that left Young flat on the field and ended a storied career.  Young, 48, inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005, now lives on the Peninsula with his wife and four children, dividing his time between working as a commentator for ESPN and doing private-equity work in Palo Alto.  In the weeks before this year's Super Bowl, we spoke with Young at Candlestick Park, where he was commentating with Jerry Rice.  Rice said Young's talent came from the way he conducted himself in the huddle.  Young talked about concussions, life after football and the beauty of fatherhood.  How is it being here at the 'Stick?  What one thing comes to mind when you think about football?  If sports has anything to do for society, football plays a great role.  What made you choose football?  Football is also an exceptionally dangerous game, and the NFL has finally started looking at the long-term effects of concussions on professional football players.  There are so many gradations of concussions.  Is the NFL doing enough to protect players?

Directs the Attorney General to withhold 10% of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funds that would otherwise be allocated to the state if the state fails to comply with such requirements. Authorizes the Attorney General to waive such withholding for a state: (1) for one year if the state provides substantial evidence that it is making a reasonable effort to comply; and (2) for additional one-year periods if the state provides substantial evidence that it is making a reasonable effort to comply and if the Attorney General withholds 5% of the amount that would otherwise be allocated to a state for each one-year period. Authorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2015 for grants under such Act to states and Indian tribal governments to establish or upgrade information and identification technologies for firearms eligibility determinations. Appropriates such authorized amount for the first fiscal year beginning after enactment of this Act and cancels a corresponding amount of the unobligated balances available under the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund.",

      "summary": "Private Property Rights Act of 1997 - States that the policy of the Federal Government is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public in a manner that, to the extent practicable, avoids takings of private property. \n(Sec. 5) Directs each Federal agency to complete a private property taking impact analysis before taking any agency action (including the promulgation of a regulation) which is likely to result in a taking of private property. \nExempts from such requirement certain:  (1) actions in which the power of eminent domain is formally exercised; (2) any action taken with respect to property held in trust by the United States or in connection with treaty negotiations; (3) law enforcement actions; (4) communications between a Federal agency and a State or local land-use planning agency about a proposed State or local activity regulating private property; (5) military activities or military or foreign affairs functions; and (6) emergencies involving immediate threats to health or safety. \nRequires that the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies under this Act. \nSpecifies the content of such an analysis and requires a copy to be transmitted to the owner of the affected property, as well as made available to the public. \nRequires each agency to provide the analysis required under this Act as part of any submission otherwise required to be made to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) relating to an agency action. \n(Sec. 6) Requires the agency, before taking any final agency action, to fully consider alternatives described in this Act, and to the maximum extent practicable, alter the action to avoid or minimize the taking of private property. \n(Sec. 7) Allows the owner of private property, if an agency action results in the taking of such property, to obtain appropriate relief in a civil action against the agency that has caused the taking to occur. Provides for a civil action against the agency to be brought:  (1) in either the U.S. District Court in which the property at issue is located or in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (currently), regardless of the amount in controversy; and (2) if the property is located in more than one judicial district, in any district in which any part of the property is located. \n(Sec. 8) Directs the Attorney General to provide legal guidance in a timely manner, in response to a request by an agency, to assist it in complying with this Act. \nRequires annual reports by each agency to the OMB Director and Attorney General identifying each agency action that has resulted in the preparation of a taking impact analysis, the filing of a taking claim, and any award of compensation pursuant to the Just Compensation Clause of the fifth amendment to the Constitution. \n(Sec. 9) Creates a rebuttable presumption that unmodified analyses five years or older are outdated for purposes of any agency action or administrative or judicial proceeding.",

Now the three videos have 5.3 million views between them.",

In the most recent attack, two men were killed Thursday in Sadr City area of Baghdad after they were disowned by relatives, the official said. The shootings came after a tribal meeting was held and the members decided to go after the victims. On March 26, four additional men were fatally shot in the same city, the official said, adding that the victims had also been disowned by their relatives. The official declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Witnesses told CNN that a Sadr City cafe, which was a popular gathering spot for gays, was also set on fire.",

But they say the US business cycle still leads the world\u2019s, in most places. Asia, where China\u2019s rise is helping the region establish business cycles largely independent of its main trading partners, is a notable exception.\n\nThe U.S.\u2019s influence on other countries\u2019 economies remains larger than direct trade ties would suggest, the authors say. That\u2019s partly because slower U.S. growth would impact not just a single partner country, but also growth in the countries that partner trades with. Other factors including increased financial integration could also play a role.\n\nSo, a negative U.S. demand shock equal to 1 percentage-point of U.S. gross-domestic product would decrease GDP in the euro-zone by more than a quarter percentage-point. Considering direct trade ties alone, that effect is just 0.1 percentage point. That pattern holds true for most of the world. Overall, Latin America\u2019s GDP would suffer the most (0.65 percentage point) from a U.S. downturn, while the U.K.\u2019s would suffer the least (0.12 percentage point).\n\nAnd bad news travels faster than good news. The ECB authors found that the impact of negative shock to the U.S. economy takes just 1-3 quarters to spread worldwide, while a U.S. growth spurt takes between 2-10 quarters. Still, the authors conclude, confirming prior research, the U.S. isn\u2019t the most important factor in global growth, noting \u201calthough a downturn in the U.S. would indeed negatively affect the world excluding the U.S., country-specific and global factors continue to dominate the outlook.\u201d -Joellen Perry\n\nRelated article: Will Europe Take Hit From U.S. Credit Woes?",
