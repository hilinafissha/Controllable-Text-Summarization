      "document": "enterovesical fistula is an abnormal communication between the bladder and the intestine ( 1 ) . \n it may occur as a result of postoperative complication of radical cystectomy and bladder substitution from the ileum , also called neobladder . \n . divided ileal loops are side - to - side or end - to - end anastomosed . \n surgical incisions and the numerous anastomoses that are performed during these complex procedures can cause intestinal or vesical leakage postoperatively . \n computed tomography ( ct ) , cystoscopy , endoscopy , barium enema , and cystography are the techniques that are recently used for diagnosis of these fistulas ( 1 ) . in some cases \n ct enterography ( cte ) is a new technique for evaluation of small bowels , surrounding structures , and the entire abdomen ( 2 - 4 ) . \n cte examination with multi - detector ct ( mdct ) enables us to get excellent quality reformatted images with high spatial resolution ( 3 - 5 ) . \n we showed the exact location of the fistula and its association with the bowels and neobladder by cte . \n we demonstrated the location of the leakage with only one technique by cte with no need of an invasive procedure . \n the aim of this case report is to show that cte can be a new and effective modality in detecting enteroneovesical fistula and to discuss the efficacy of cte in the detection and evaluation of enterovesical fistula referring to the literature . to the best of our knowledge , \n cte usage in such cases has not been reported before in the literature so far . \n we think that this case report could be useful for early and correct diagnosis of similar cases . \n a 64-year - old man presented with feces coming from the transurethral catheter 5 days after radical cystectomy and neobladder operation . \n the fistula location could not be detected with abdominal ultrasonography ( us ) , ct , cystoscopy , antegrade pyelography , barium enema and cystography ( figure 1 ) . \n 1250 ml of oral contrast - material solution , which was composed of 500 ml water , 200 ml lactulose ( 667 mg / ml , osmolac , biofarma , turkey ) , and 450 ml dilute - mixed barium sulfate suspension especially designed for ct ( e - z - cat , opakim , turkey ) , was ingested orally over 60 minutes at a steady rate . \n after administration of oral contrast agent , cte with 2 mm slice thickness was performed with a 64-detector mdct machine ( aquilion 64 , toshiba , tokyo , japan ) . \n after cte examination , sagittal and coronal reformatted images ( slice thickness : 1 mm ) were obtained by routinely available workstation inside the mdct machine . \n ileoneovesical fistula ( from the anastomose side ) was determined on cte images ( figure 2 ) . \n therefore , follow - up with transurethral catheter was recommended . if necessary , operation was planned . \n enteroneovesical fistula is a rare condition that can be difficult to diagnose ( 1 ) . \n the most common causes of enterovesical fistulas are crohn disease , enteritis , ulcerative colitis , trauma , postoperative - postradiotheraphy complications , penetrating injuries , bladder carcinomas , pelvic inflammatory disease , foreign bodies , and abscesses ( 6 , 7 ) . \n in addition , they may occur as a postoperative complication of radical cystectomy and neobladder substitution procedure . \n the other common findings are pneumaturia and recurrent urinary infections ( 6 , 7 ) . however \n , classical symptoms are only evident in 50% of patients with confirmed fistulae ( 1 ) . \n ct , cystoscopy , endoscopy , barium enema , and cystography are mainly used for diagnosis of enterovesical fistulas ( 1 ) . \n neocystogram examination of the neobladder ( after administration of a diluted contrast agent solution via transurethral catheter ) is the most frequent method used for the diagnosis of enteroneovesical fistula ( 6 , 7 ) . \n another disadvantage of neocystography is that the diluted contrast agent solution given into the bladder with high pressure and in large amounts can result in a new leakage site iatrogenically . \n some ct criteria are used for diagnosis of enterovesical fistulas such as presence of air within the bladder , focal bladder - bowel wall thickening , and presence of an associated soft - tissue mass ( 6 , 7 ) \n . however , the percentages of success in demonstrating the fistulas are not as high as it is expected ( 6 , 7 ) . as a result , \n another new technique is necessary to demonstrate enterovesical fistulas , their causes , and the communication site . \n the fact that in our case , the fistula and its localization were not detected by other techniques and were only detected by cte , supports this idea . \n cte has become a valuable technique in detecting small bowel diseases such as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding , suspected small - bowel tumor and especially inflammatory bowel diseases ( 3 - 5 ) . \n cte is a well - tolerated imaging technique that unlike ct enteroclysis , does not need nasoenteric intubation ( 8 , 9 ) . \n the images taken following the ingestion of large amounts of oral contrast material enables us to detect the small bowel lumen and wall more successfully ( 2 - 4 ) . \n small bowel distension also makes contrast agent leakage from the fistula more prominent . as a result \n , leakages that can not be detected by routine ct can be detected by cte . \n cte examination with 64 mdct enables us to get isotropic voxels and excellent quality reformatted images with high spatial resolution that is more easily diagnosed while evaluating the operation site and neobladder ( 2 - 5 ) . \n cte may be a useful , sensitive , effective , and non - invasive technique for the evaluation of enteroneovesical fistulas , leakage from the anastomose sides in postoperative cases , and other extraintestinal complications such as urinary tract obstruction or abscess formation .",
      "summary": "enterovesical fistula is an abnormal communication between the bladder and the intestine . \n the accurate localization of leakage is important for accurate treatment planning . \n some imaging techniques can not demonstrate the fistula ; therefore , choosing the appropriate imaging technique is necessary . \n ct enterography ( cte ) is a new technique for evaluation of the small bowel and the entire abdomen . \n cte examination with multi - detector ct ( mdct ) enables us to get excellent quality reformatted images with high spatial resolution . \n we report a patient with neobladder and enteroneovesical fistula . we showed the exact location of the fistula and its association with the bowels and neobladder by cte . \n the aim of this report is to show that cte can be a new and effective modality in the detection of enteroneovesical fistulas and to discuss the efficacy of cte in the detection and evaluation of enterovesical fistula referring to the literature . in conclusion \n , cte may be a useful , sensitive , effective , and non - invasive technique for the evaluation of enteroneovesical fistula , leakage from the anastomose sides , and other extraintestinal complications such as urinary tract obstruction or abscess formation .",

grade ii , 5 to 10 mm ; and grade iii , > 10 mm . \n ipp grade iii reaches 80% sensitivity and 68% specificity for diagnosing boo when compared with urodynamic evaluation . \n authors have calculated the uebw from the measurement of bwt and bladder volume and found that a threshold value of 35 g best distinguishes the difference between obstructed and unobstructed bladders . \n however , other authors have evaluated patients with luts and found that uebw did not present any individual correlation with luts or objective measurements of boo . \n schafer first described noninvasive urodynamics in 1994 when he used a condom catheter ( fig . \n mcrae et al .   developed a cuff to obstruct the urine flow ( fig . \n the principle of these tests is to interrupt the flow and measure the bladder pressure . \n the detrusor contraction is maintained and the urethral sphincters remain open and the column of fluid from the urethra to the bladder is sufficient to measure the bladder pressure ( isometric pressure ) ( fig . 5 ) . in conjunction with the bioengineering department at unicamp ( university of campinas ) , \n a new device consists of a urethral connector which is placed in the fossa navicularis was developed ( fig . \n the initial model consisted of only a device to which the transducer was connected and the interruption of the flow was done by the patient himself . \n the mammograms utilized in conventional urodynamic evaluation are not applied in noninvasive urodynamics . statistical analysis and logistic regression \n operating characteristic curve was constructed , which showed a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 79% . \n a study was performed to compare the time flow , flow max , and volume between noninvasive and conventional urodynamics and the results showed no significant differences . with the objective of facilitating the realization of this study , modifications of the urethral connector were proposed . in a previous study , \n the system is composed of a pressure transducer , an electrical isolation enlargement board ( national instruments ni usb-6215 ) , and registered software from labview ( national instruments , austin , tx , usa ) . with these , it was possible to test new models ( fig . \n after various tests , version ii of the urethral connector was developed , in which the transducer is attached to the connector ( fig . \n 8) . a graph of the vesical pressure registered during a clinical exam with the urethral connector ii is shown in fig . \n the arrows indicate the approximated movement in which the individual is instructed to close the exit of the device . \n note that the pressure slowly increases until it reaches the approximated static value , corresponding to the isovolumetric vesical pressure . \n the flow is stopped several times during voiding , for periods of 2 to 3 seconds , which permits greater accuracy of the vesical pressure . for the comparison of two methods , conventional and connector , \n the vesical pressure at maximal flow and maximal vesical pressure with the noninvasive method were used . \n the linear regression resulted in an angular coefficient of 2.000.49 , r=0.8016 , with a 95% confidence interval of 0.6190 to 3.38l . \n the procedure for occlusion of the flow by use of the urethral connector to avoid hydraulic shock was not adopted without reason . in a previous study \n , laboratory simulations showed that abrupt occlusion could cause a rapid and significant increase in the pressure . \n 9 was observed , with a gradual increase of pressure until a static value was reached , which corresponded to the isometric vesical pressure . according to the patients , a closing time of 2 to 3 seconds was not long enough to cause any discomfort . \n this has already been verified by other methods showing that there is no contraction inhibition of the detrusor during a brief interruption of the flow . \n the registered vesical pressure values of the urethral connector were compared with the conventional urodynamic method , and the curve can be seen in fig . \n the conventional method registers the pressure of a free flow , whereas the connector measures the value during an interrupted flow . \n thus , although the pressures measured for each method reflect the contractile activity of the detrusor , the values are not necessarily identical . however , a linear correlation between the measured pressures is observed , which shows the sensitivity of the connector when registering the vesical pressure . considering that the flows registered by use of both methods were not different \n , this suggests that the connector does not cause an increase of resistance of the urinary flow , and the necessary interruptions for measuring the vesical pressure do not significantly alter the parameters evaluated . \n the study of noninvasive urodynamic evaluation has generated much research ; however , it has not been adopted in daily practice . \n it is difficult to interpret the results and it does not evaluate the phase of vesical filling and has a bit of an engineering characteristic . because it is a noninvasive method , it should be used in the first consultation with the patient , when the symptoms have first begun to appear and not when it is time to schedule surgery . \n the exam most probably should be placed between the flowmetry and the conventional urodynamic study . \n the great advantages of using the urethral connector are as follows : minimal discomfort , minimal risk of urinary tract infection , and low cost . \n this method can be repeated many times , permitting the evaluation of obstruction during clinical treatment . \n the connector should be used to diagnose boo , for the evaluation for surgery , and in screening for treatment . in the future \n , noninvasive urodynamics can be used to identify patients with boo , start early medical treatment , and evaluate the results .",

4 ] . here , we describe a very rare case of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ( atc ) associated with graves ' disease , following rai treatment . \n a 42-year - old woman was referred to our clinic in 1998 , because of palpitations , hand tremor , and laboratory findings of hyperthyroidism ( serum thyrotropin [ thyroid - stimulating hormone , tsh ] 0.05 iu / ml [ reference range , 0.17 to 4.05 ] , free thyroxine 4.01 ng / dl [ reference range , 0.79 to 1.86 ] , and positive tsh receptor antibody at 201.7% [ percent binding inhibition index , radioreceptor assay , reference range ; 15.0% ] ) , and had been diagnosed as graves ' disease . \n a technetium-99 m thyroid scan showed enlarged and homogeneously increased uptake , and ultrasonography revealed a diffuse goiter without nodules . \n the patient received 200 mg / day of propylthiouracil and -adrenergic blocking agents for 1 year . \n however , due to recurrent hyperthyroidism , she received rai therapy twice with an administered dose 370 mbq ( 10 mci ) , 296 mbq ( 8 mci ) , each . \n two years later , she received thyroid hormone replacement due to subsequent hypothyroidism at a local clinic . in september 2010 , over 10 years later , she revisited us with complaints of hoarseness , dysphagia , and dyspnea , which had been presented for 2 months . \n an anterior neck mass , which was hard and fixed , and some lymph nodes ( lns ) around the mass were palpable . \n her chest radiography showed a tracheal narrowing and deviation to the right without active lung lesion . on computed tomography ( ct ) of the neck , \n positron emission tomography - ct , an intense hypermetabolic lesion was noted in the thyroid gland and lns on her left neck without distant metastasis . \n a total thyroidectomy with selective neck dissection , tracheal sleeve resection , and end - to - end anastomosis were performed . \n subsequently , she had concurrent cisplatin - based chemoradiotherapy for her neck and superior mediastinum ( total 6,600 cgy/33 fractions ) . \n after 4 months of follow - up , despite the aggressive treatment , the disease progressed . \n on neck ct , a new focal necrotic mass on the left side of her neck was noted , suggesting local recurrence . \n the mass extended up to the tracheal lumen and the patient died of sudden uncontrolled bleeding in the airway . \n the patient in this case received rai therapy twice for recurrent hyperthyroidism . after more than 10 years , she developed respiratory symptoms and was finally diagnosed with atc . \n this case raises questions about the causal relationship between rai therapy for graves ' disease and the subsequent occurrence of thyroid cancer . \n although it has been widely accepted that rai is safe , some studies have suggested that rai therapy is possibly associated with a small increased risk of thyroid cancer [ 2 - 4 ] . \n degroot   reported that the rai treatment can induce an increase of thyroid antibodies , such as tsh receptor antibody , and it was suggested that thyroid stimulating antibodies play an important role in thyroid carcinogenesis . \n these antibodies also can stimulate angiogenesis , which contributes to thyroid tumor cell growth , by activating vascular endothelial growth factor . \n sturgis   reported cytomorphologic alterations in thyroid follicular epithelium , which is associated with rai therapy . before treatment , graves ' disease typically lack significant atypia , while after rai therapy , nuclear atypia , and progressive cellular metaplasia could be seen microscopically . \n furthermore , it was prominent in those who remain in a hyperthyroid state despite rai treatment . \n in addition to our case , two previously reported cases of atc after rai therapy for documented graves ' disease are summarized in table 1 . \n baker   reported a 64-year - old woman with atc 12 years after rai therapy . because thyroid toxicity persisted after one course of rai therapy , the patient received a second therapy in 4 months . \n gossage et al .   reported a 46-year - old woman who had her first rai therapy , when aged only 23 years . \n although she underwent partial thyroidectomy prior to the rai therapy , hyperthyroidism recurred and she received several subsequent doses of radioiodine . \n an analysis of these cases is noteworthy , because since the interval to cancer diagnosis was over 10 years in all cases , it supports the importance of long - term vigilance in patients receiving rai therapy . \n in addition , these cases had something in common in terms of the occurrence of atc after repetitive , small doses of rai therapy . \n the cooperative thyrotoxicosis therapy follow - up study showed that thyroid neoplasms developed in children treated with lower , rather than higher , doses of rai therapy , which is compatible with our finding . \n therefore , it can be hypothesized that multiple courses of rai therapy , with small doses , may play a role in carcinogenesis , especially in the poorly differentiated type . \n .   demonstrated that i treatment inactivates the tumor suppressor gene that is frequently found in atc rather than in the differentiated type . \n however , to discuss the causal relationship between rai therapy and the occurrence of cancer , the number of reports is too small , therefore a population - based study is required and this is a limitation of our report . \n in addition to the rai therapy , we can not exclude that graves ' disease itself might also increase the risk of cancer . although our patient had no thyroid nodule by ultrasonography , \n the palpable thyroid nodules found in graves ' patients have a 16.9% malignancy rate , which is higher than that of the general population . \n moreover , the finding that thyroid autoantibody stimulates the malignant transformation of the thyroid gland supports this suggestion . \n it is not clear that the occurrence of atc reported here was influenced by rai therapy or , alternatively , it may only represent the delayed recognition of a rare change in the natural history of graves ' disease . \n nevertheless , this report is worthwhile since it presents a very rare case of atc that occurred 11 years after rai therapy for graves ' disease .",

      "document": "intracorporeal colorectal anastomosing techniques have been the topic of considerable experimental research since the original description by jacobs et al . \n nevertheless , completely laparoscopic colorectal procedures have been adopted in clinical practice by a limited number of surgeons . \n this is possibly due to increased operating time and costs , to the fact that their relative benefit is as yet unclear , and that these procedures are technically demanding . \n the latter reason prompted this experimental study , which was carried out to evaluate whether a previously described intracorporeal approach to sigmoid resection could be facilitated and applied to the rectum in a porcine model . \n ten domestic pigs with a median weight of 40.7 kg ( range 38.5 - 43 kg ) were anesthetized with intubation and ventilation with halothane . prior to surgery \n , the animals were fasted for 48 hours and kept on fluids ad libitum and received a 2-liter enema . \n pneumoperitoneum was induced using carbon dioxide insufflated to a pressure of 10 mm hg by placement of a trocar in the infraumbilical skin using a cut - down technique . \n two 12 mm ports were then inserted in the left hypocondrium and in the midline cephalad to the umbilicus . due to porcine anatomy , \n a 33 mm cannula ( endopath , ethicon endosurgery , cincinnati , oh ) was inserted in the right iliac fossa rather than suprapubically . \n all subjects were turned into a steep head - down position in addition to a right lateral tilt until no small bowel was seen in the field . a surgical technique previously described for laparoscopic sigmoid resection with intracorporeal colorectal anastomosis and specimen removal via a suprapubic incision \n once the proximal site of bowel division was identified , a laparoscopic pursestring clamp ( ethicon endosurgery , cincinnati , oh ) ( figure 1 ) was applied to the colon , and two straight needles ( placed at opposite ends of a monofilament suture and held in position against the clamp by an endoloop ) were passed through the clamp and retrieved through a port , as previously described . \n the colon was divided with scissors against the pursestring clamp after having been ligated with an intracorporeally knotted suture . \n the lower third of the rectum was transected with an articulating endoscopic stapler ( ets flex 35 , ethicon endosurgery , cincinnati , oh ) . a plastic bag allowed temporary intra - abdominal storage of the specimen . \n the rectal stump was irrigated by 1uminal wash - out in order to verify that the linear staple row was tight . \n the anvil of a circular stapler ( ecs 25 ethicon endosurgery , cincinnati , oh ) held by a modified allis - clamp was inserted through the 33 mm port into the colon and the pursestring was tied intracorporeally around the anvil notch . the same circular gun with a spike fixed to its shaft was introduced per anum ( figure 2 ) , and a doublestapled colorectal anastomosis was performed according to a previously - described technique . \n the integrity of the anastomosis was checked by irrigation with methylene blue after the application of a noncrushing intestinal clamp just proximal to the circular staple line . \n the specimen , in a plastic bag , was delivered through the 33 mm port . \n circular stapler with spike fixed to its shaft is advanced behind the staple line of the rectal stump . \n complete proximal and distal doughnuts were obtained in all cases and anastomoses were all methylene blue tight . \n the mean anastomotic level from the anal verge was 5.2 cm ( range 4 - 6 cm ) . \n all porcine subjects had an uneventful 5-week postoperative course at the end of which both laparoscopy and rigid proctoscopy were carried out . at celioscopy \n there were no adhesions or other abnormalities at the anastomotic site , while endoscopy revealed normal suture lines . \n histology of colorectal anastomoses revealed healing mucosa with neither foreign body reactions nor thickening of bowel wall at anastomotic site . \n transection of the rectum at a lower level can be achieved inserting an open - surgery articulating stapler through a suprapubic incision . however \n , this approach requires a third stapler ( in addition to endoscopic linear and circular staplers ) , re - establishing pneumoperitoneum twice , and manipulation of an open - surgery stapling device with laparoscopic graspers . \n the results of the present experimental study show that the use of a laparoscopic articulating stapling device helps to overcome these downsides and allows secure division of the low rectum . \n intracorporeally hand - sewn pursestring sutures are usually fashioned with curved or ski - shaped needles on the proximal colon , but this is a time - consuming procedure . \n the introduction of the t - needle technique ( endo - stitch , ussc , norwalk , ct ) failed to facilitate this procedure . \n in fact , since the t - needle should not be detached from the instrument 's jaws ( unless for reloading ) , the anvil shaft must , at a certain point , be loosened from the allis - clamp to allow 360 suturing and tying around the pursestring notch of the anvil . \n , that the use of a laparoscopic pursestring suture clamp seems to facilitate the construction of intracorporeal pursestring sutures and results in a safe colorectal anastomosis . according to previously described techniques , \n once the circular stapling gun 's central spike ( auto suture , pceeatm , ussc , norwalk , connecticut ) is advanced behind the staple line of the rectal stump , the spike must be disconnected and removed through a port ( figure 3 ) . \n the use of a gun adapted for laparoscopy ( with a spike fixed to its shaft ) ( figure 2 ) eliminates the need for retrieval of the spike . \n the present study shows that a previously described intracorporeal approach to sigmoid resection can be facilitated and applied safely to the rectum in a porcine model . \n however , further experimental and clinical comparative studies are needed with regard to safety , time - frame and costs of the construction of intracorporeal pursestring sutures .",

      "document": "maintenance of motion following arthroplasty can be hindered by the development of heterotopic ossification ( ho ) , whose causes remain uncertain.1,2,3,4,5 whether the formation of ho following cervical disc arthroplasty is of clinical or functional importance is also unknown . \n the aims of this study are to investigate the rate of ho at a longer follow - up ( mean 3 years ) , to determine if the presence of ho negatively affects functional outcome and to identify factors that may precipitate the formation of ho following cervical disc arthroplasty . \n what is the incidence of ho following cervical arthroplasty ? does the development of ho negatively influence the clinical outcome in patients receiving arthroplasty ? \n inclusion criteria : patients suffering from radiculopathy , myelopathy or myeloradiculopathy secondary to soft disc hernia and/or mild degree spondylosis operated between october 2004 and december 2006 . \n 1 ) thirty - nine patients suffering from cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy treated with anterior disc replacement ( adr ) were selected . \n nine patients were excluded from this analysis because of insufficient outcome data at different time intervals ( n  =  7 ) or were not available for follow - up ( n  =  2 ) . \n outcomes and analysis evidence of ho using the mcafee grading system6 ( table 1 ) . \n rom was calculated by using two lines parallel to the prodisc - c keels , or to the endplates of the prestige lp , and measuring the intervening angle in flexion and extension on lateral radiographs . \n lordosis was assigned a negative value and kyphosis a positive one ; the difference between the two values gave the final rom . \n ct scan on patients with grade two or higher ho to assess localization of ho . \n a comparison of scores was made between those who developed ho and those who did not using a two - sided student t - test . \n all images were independently reviewed by both a radiologist and a neurosurgeon not directly involved in the surgical procedures . \n forty - five disc prostheses ( seven prestige - lp and 38 prodisc - c ) were implanted in 30 patients ( 18 males ) ranging in age from 2863 years ( mean age 40.9 ) . \n the underlying disease included radiculopathy ( n  =  13 ) , myelopathy ( n  =  4 ) or myeloradiculopathy ( n  =  13 ) , secondary to soft - disc hernia ( n  =  17 ) , spondylosis ( n  =  8) or a combination of disc hernia and spondylosis ( n  =  5 ) . \n nineteen patients received one - level disc replacement , seven patients received two - level and four patients received three level disc replacement . \n the following distribution of prostheses / level was recorded : c34:5 ; c45:4 ; c56:23 ; c67:13 ( table 2 ) . the incidence rate of ho using the number of prostheses as the denominator was 42.2% ( 19 levels in 16 patients , fig . \n the risk of a patient developing ho after receiving one or more prostheses was 53.3% ( 16/30 ) . \n ten patients showed progressive ossification over time : in six patients de novo ho was demonstrated at 2346 months ( mean 33.3 ) postoperatively ( figs . 2 , 3 ) . \n among the 16 patients with ho , 15 ( 93.8% ) demonstrated a range of motion 3 ( fig . \n comparison of pre- and postoperative sf-36 and ndi scores revealed functional improvement from baseline to follow - up at 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , and 36 months . \n there was no significant difference in functional scores between those who did and those who did not develop ho , p  >  .05 ( fig . \n risks and relative risks by factor related to patient characteristics associated with ho formation were analyzed : males tended to develop ho more than females ( twice as likely ) , though this did not reach statistical significance ( table 3 ) . \n no patients required revision surgery for adjacent segment disease or persisting / recurrent symptoms . \n patient population and intervention   double - level arthroplasty with prodisc - c at c56 and c67 . \n absence of ho at 1 month after surgery ( left ) , presence of grade two ho 1 year postoperatively ( middle ) and of grade three ho ( right ) 3 years postoperatively , respectively . \n note the progression of ho at the c45 disc space at 1 month ( left ) , 12 ( middle ) and 48 ( right ) months , respectively , postoperatively ( arrow ) . \n flexion and extension x - rays ( same patient as in fig 3 ) showing mobile disc prostheses at 48-months follow - up despite the presence of heterotopic ossification . \n our rate of grade two and three ho ( 42.2% ) is consistent with that previously reported.7 it is higher than in other series8,9 but lower than sola 's et al.10 ho is prevalent on the anterolateral surface of vertebral bodies ( fig . \n strengths : this study reports 3 years mean follow - up data , to date the longest available . for all included patients complete follow - up data are available . \n furthermore , we have shown that a delayed progression , or de novo onset , of ho is possible . \n limitations : this study was not conducted prospectively and is based on a relatively small albeit consecutive sample size . \n lack of potential prognostic factors available for analysis and a 77% follow - up rate are further limitations . \n a longer follow - up is necessary to assess whether arthroplasty can reach the goal of maintaining motion and if development of high - grade ho at the target level infers an increased risk of adjacent segment degeneration . \n clinical and functional improvement following cervical disc arthroplasty is maintained despite the presence of ho . \n preventative measures such as prophylactic nonsteroidal medications , local application of bone wax or intentional early range of motion measures were not routinely utilized in our study . while these are interesting factors , \n axial ct scan showing the presence of laterally sited ho ( arrows ) at c45 level ( a ) and at c67 level ( b )   number of ossified levels and stratification for mcafee ossification grades ( ho : heterotopic ossification )   differences of pre- and postoperative functional outcome in the two groups \n disc replacement offers a new interventional option and long - term data on the potential complications to artificial disc replacement compared with fusion are very much needed . \n this prospective study 's contribution to the literature regarding heterotopic ossification ( ho ) following cervical arthroplasty is appreciated . \n as the authors note , the causes of ho in disc arthroplasty remain unclear and are probably multifactorial . \n ho frequency : the authors report a ho rate of 42% following artificial disc replacement in 32 patients , a higher overall rate than is reported in most other studies . \n ho rates in the may 2008 ebss special edition on cervical arthroplasty were summarized as follows : there were no ho cases reported in two rcts , with follow - up of 24 months in one study and other being a preliminary report with most patients having only 12-months follow - up . \n ho was , however , common in two case series with one reporting an overall 18% rate or 7% cases when restricted to grades iii or iv . \n the other series of patients with 1 , 2 , or 3 level disease reported that 8% of segments had grade i , 39% of segments had grade \n ii , 10% had ho leading to restricted movement and 9% experienced spontaneous fusion . \n there are several factors which may partially explain discrepancies in ho rates across studies , aside from differences in length of follow - up . \n it is possible that increased attention to radiographic detail may go hand in hand with increased reporting . grading the severity of ho is not an exact science . \n there is some subjectivity which may translate into difficulty in distinguishing between adjacent grades ( eg , between grades 2 and 3 ) and overlap in classification . \n the grading of ho has so far not been subjected to inter- and intra - observer reliability evaluation and is not known to correlate with any health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) outcomes measures . \n study specifications and protocols : use of structured measures and protocols in a prospective study , which are consistently applied to all patients , is important to decrease study bias . while the authors suggest that structured protocols were used , no details were provided . \n reporting detail about protocols assists in determining the extent to which various factors may or may not have influenced the results . for studies of ho , important protocol details should include whether or not bone waxing was done at the osteotomy site as well as specifics for radiographic measurements and use of antiinflammatory medications . \n it is unclear whether early initiation of range of motion creates an inflammatory response which contributes to ho formation or if it facilitates functional outcome . \n strengths : the use of validated outcomes measures ( ndi and sf-36 ) is commendable as is the authors ' acknowledgment of small sample size and a relatively low follow - up rate \n ( 77% ) as study limitations .",

In a decision that could affect every one of the nation's 185 million drivers, the sharply divided court said that cops cuffing motorists after roadside stops for minor infractions do not violate the constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure. The case before the court involved a Texas soccer mom who was arrested, handcuffed and hauled off to jail for failing to use seat belts for herself and her 4- and 6-year-olds. Police generally can arrest anyone they see breaking the law, the court said as it barred the woman from suing the officer who arrested her. Gail Atwater was driving her two children home from soccer practice in 1997 in Lago Vista, Tex., when she was stopped and arrested. A friend looked after her children and her pickup truck was towed away. Atwater's mug shot was taken and she was released after posting bond. She later pleaded no contest to the seat belt offense and paid the maximum $50 fine. She and her husband, Michael Haas, then sued the city and the police officer. The city's lawyer had argued that police often don't have enough information to know if someone's actions are a misdemeanor or felony. \"The question is whether the Fourth Amendment forbids a warrantless arrest for a minor criminal offense. ... We hold that it does not,\" Justice David Souter wrote for the majority - Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer dissented. Some states allow officers to arrest people for offenses punishable only by a fine, while others prohibit it. The NYPD's legal bureau will review today's Supreme Court ruling, \"and make appropriate recommendations,\" said Carmen Melendez, a department spokeswoman.",

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The earthquake and resulting tsunami of December 26, \n        2004, resulted in the deaths of over 230,000 people in \n        Southeast Asia.\n            (2) The geological fault line along which the December 26th \n        tsunami occurred is mirrored by a fault line that runs along \n        the whole of the west coast of the United States.\n            (3) Scientists predict that there is a 10 to 15 percent \n        chance of a major seismic event along this fault line, the \n        Cascadia Subduction Zone, occurring in the next 50 years.\n            (4) Such an event would probably include both a large-scale \n        earthquake and a tsunami, causing incredible damage to both \n        infrastructure and emergency response services.\n            (5) Numerous false alarms in the past year have \n        demonstrated that many coastal communities are not prepared if \n        such a geological event takes place.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE AND GOALS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of the Community Hazard Assessment and \nMitigation Program (CHAMP) is to award one-year grants directly to \nemergency management departments to build and maintain infrastructure \nto warn people of an approaching tsunami and to address post-tsunami \nneeds.\n    (b) Goals.--The primary goal of this Act is to provide assistance \nto meet the needs of emergency management departments regarding tsunami \nhazard preparedness, mitigation, and response. In part, the program \nseeks to support departments that lack the tools and resources \nnecessary to protect the health and safety of the public and emergency \nresponse personnel with respect to a tsunami and its aftermath. In \naddition, any improvement in warning systems for the coastal \ncommunities will improve all hazard capabilities.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Grant Authorization.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, \nacting through the Director of the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration, may provide grants in accordance with this Act to \ncertain areas to prepare for a tsunami.\n    (b) Priority.--The Director shall give priority to areas in which \nthe likelihood of a tsunami striking in the next 50 years is 10 percent \nor greater.\n    (c) Competitive Awards.--In addition to the priority given pursuant \nto subsection (b), the Director shall award a grant under this Act to \nemergency management departments on a competitive basis considering \nfinancial need, benefit to the community and a demonstrated ability to \ncooperate with other providers of emergency services.\n\nSEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS.\n\n    An emergency management department that receives a grant under this \nAct may use grant funds--\n            (1) to establish or improve warning systems, including the \n        purchase of--\n                    (A) sirens;\n                    (B) individual weather radios;\n                    (C) public safety agency communications gear; and\n                    (D) reverse 911 systems;\n            (2) to purchase public safety agency rescue equipment;\n            (3) to reinforce buildings and facilities in maintaining \n        continuity of critical services, including--\n                    (A) police stations;\n                    (B) fire stations;\n                    (C) emergency management facilities;\n                    (D) hospitals;\n                    (E) shelters; and\n                    (F) endangered sewer sanitation systems;\n            (4) post-tsunami shelters and supplies; and\n            (5) to develop outreach programs to educate both residents \n        and tourists of different types of tsunami (near shore and far \n        field) and how to react to each type.\n\nSEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS.\n\n    (a) Population of More Than 50,000.--To be eligible to receive a \ngrant under this Act, an emergency management department serving an \narea with a population over 50,000 shall provide, with non-Federal \nfunds, 20 percent of the total cost of a project established with a \ngrant provided under this Act.\n    (b) Population Between 20,001 and 50,000.--To be eligible to \nreceive a grant under this Act, an emergency management department \nserving an area with a population between 20,001 and 50,000 shall \nprovide, with non-Federal funds, 10 percent of the total cost of a \nproject established with a grant provided under this Act.\n    (c) Population Under 20,000.--To be eligible to receive a grant \nunder this Act, an emergency management department serving an area with \na population under 20,000 shall provide, with non-Federal funds, 5 \npercent of the total cost of a project established with a grant \nprovided under this Act.\n    (d) In-Kind Contributions.--In determining the non-Federal share of \nthe total costs of a project, the Secretary shall consider in-kind \ncontributions of an emergency management department, not to exceed 50 \npercent of the amount that the department contributes in non-Federal \nfunds.\n\nSEC. 7. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\n\n    (a) Evaluation.--Not later than 180 days after grants are awarded \nunder this Act, the Director shall determine if emergency management \ndepartments that received a grant under this section meet the standards \nfor certification by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration as being tsunami ready and evaluate the effectiveness \nand tsunami readiness of programs established pursuant to this Act.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the evaluation is \ncompleted under subsection (a), the Director shall report such findings \nto the appropriate Committees of Congress.\n\nSEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of the \nFederal Emergency Management Administration.\n    (b) Emergency Management Department.--The term ``emergency \nmanagement department'' means an agency or organization that is part \nof, or has a formally recognized arrangement with, a State, territory, \nlocal, or tribal authority (city, county, parish, fire district, \ntownship, town, or other governing body) and is responsible for \nplanning, preparing, and providing for the prevention, mitigation, and \nmanagement of emergencies or disasters that present a threat to the \nlives and property of the citizens and visitors of the community.\n    (c) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the 50 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, \nthe United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto \nRico.\n\nSEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n$100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 to the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security to carry out the \nactivities of this Community hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program.\n    (b) Reservation.--From the amount made available to carry out this \nAct, the Director may reserve 5 percent for administrative costs.\n    (c) Availability.--Such funds shall remain available until \nexpended.",

      "document": "In the cancer world, when doctors get stumped by a particular case, they often turn to colleagues for a group consult that\u2019s known as a \u201ctumor board.\u201d\n\nThat expert input usually depends on having a group of specialists down the hall. But sometimes doctors want input from someone they don\u2019t see every day, or they work in small hospitals, or lack a particular specialist on their team.\n\nNow a Boston-based medical service is creating an online platform that can act like a virtual tumor board for physicians and specialists from all fields who want to ask for help or trade advice with peers from around the world. It is a group exercise that could lead to faster, more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans for patients.\n\n\u201cThe more doctors you can share a difficult case with, the more apt we are to find more brain power around the world and the better off we\u2019re going to be as patients, and that\u2019s what this is all about,\u201d said Eric Glazer, vice president of physician engagement and social media for Best Doctors, which is launching the online platform called Medting.\n\nIn its main business, Best Doctors, based on Federal Street, acts as a second opinion service, by offering diagnostic and treatment consultations from doctors who are tops in their fields. The company says it serves more than 30 million patients around the world, mostly through contracts with large employers; participating physicians are paid a fee for their advice.\n\nThe idea to create a platform for consults-in-the-cloud started in the United States with a group of blood cancer experts who are active in their trade group, the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and who wanted a better way to offer one another advice on difficult bone-marrow cases. One of those physicians, who had consulted for Best Doctors, suggested the society use Medting as a place for the specialists to exchange input on cases. The idea blossomed from there.\n\n\u201cSo far it\u2019s been a resounding success,\u201d said Dr. Miguel-Angel Perales, a member of the society and deputy chief of adult bone marrow transplant services at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\nPerales said more than 200 blood and bone marrow specialists have signed on to the collaboration and have so far reviewed some 30 to 40 cases together. Based on the experience of the bone marrow group, Best Doctors believes physicians in other fields would benefit from having a similar online exchange where vexing cases be discussed.\n\nThe company is encouraging other medical societies, physicians\u2019 organizations, and health care nonprofits to subscribe to Medting and create platforms in their fields.\n\nGlazer said Best Doctors hopes the service will go viral within a range of specialties, fostering collaborations and spreading knowledge. Best Doctors will not disclose terms but said the subscription fee will be modest, just enough to cover its cost of providing the service.\n\nThe protocol is straightforward. A doctor looking for help logs onto Medting and simply posts questions, as well as a description and relevant images, such as MRI scans of tumors. Peers respond whenever they have free time, offering advice and opinions.\n\nResponses on Medting may come even faster than they do at a typical tumor board, Glazer said, because doctors can answer on their own time, rather than having to coordinate busy schedules for a sit-down meeting.\n\nPerales cited one recent example in which a doctor sought help from the blood specialists about an older patient who could not get a marrow transplant until his leukemia was under control. Another doctor from the Mayo Clinic saw the posting and suggested the physician try a drug normally used to treat a different type of leukemia. The drug worked, Perales said, and the patient is now scheduled for a transplant, which could cure him.\n\nDr. Mark Litzow, a hematologist and bone marrow transplant specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has access to some of the best doctors in the world right in his own building. But Mayo doctors can learn from colleagues elsewhere in the medical world, he said.\n\n\u201cSometimes at the same institution, people tend to think in similar ways,\u201d Litzow said. \u201cIf you can tap into someone\u2019s brain who\u2019s at a different institution or someone who thinks a little bit differently, it can be helpful. It\u2019s like teaching: Sometimes you get as much or more out of it than the students do. It can refresh my thinking about a particular situation.\u201d",

      "document": "ISTANBUL, May 8 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's said on Friday there was a one-in-three chance it could downgrade Turkey's sovereign rating in as little as six months, citing growing concerns about central bank independence.\n\nS&P cut the lira's local currency rating to \"BBB-/A-3\" from \"BBB/A-2\". In what is likely to be a small relief for investors, it kept the more closely watched foreign currency sovereign rating untouched, but warned that could change.\n\n\"Overall, we now consider that the challenged credibility of the central bank, including a weakened monetary transmission channel, has diminished the status of the Turkish lira as a reliable transactional currency,\" S&P said in a statement.\n\n\"There is at least a one-in-three likelihood that we could downgrade Turkey within the next 6-12 months if Turkey's fiscal performance and debt metrics were to deviate from current expectations.\"\n\nThe lira has been hammered this year, hitting a series of record lows on concerns about political meddling in monetary policy. Facing flagging growth and parliamentary elections in June, President Tayyip Erdogan has fulminated against high interest rates, equating them to treason.\n\nThat has put pressure on the central bank, which has kept rates on hold even as economists say it needs to tighten to give the lira a much-needed boost. Instead, it has resorted to tweaking more obscure policy tools, moves that some critics say only reinforce perceptions of its declining independence.\n\nExternal and monetary risk, including a considerable current account deficit, persist, S&P said. Inflation, which is likely to average 7 percent this year remains a problem, as does the tumbling lira, S&P said.\n\n\"We could revise the outlook to stable if economic growth continued to rebalance and depended less heavily on external borrowing,\" it said.\n\n(Reporting by David Dolan; Editing by Susan Fenton)",

Requires the national research center, established under the Act, to engage in evaluation and technical assistance activities that will assist in: (1) collecting information on the industry-recognized credentials awarded to participants in career and technical education programs, and (2) developing the necessary infrastructure to support the state and local reporting of specified related information. Makes it a responsibility of the state agency involved to establish statewide credit transfer agreements aligned to approved career and technical education programs of study. Requires each local plan for career and technical education programs to describe how the eligible recipient of assistance will partner with business and industry to: (1) identify opportunities for experiential and work-based learning opportunities either in-person or virtually, (2) ensure the career and technical education programs of study are responsive to community and employment demands and meet other specified criteria, and (3) ensure funding under the Act is spent in a coordinated manner with other local resources. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to revise the purpose of grants for demonstration projects of innovative practices to require the projects to show the most promise of enabling the children served to meet rigorous, state-identified college and career readiness standards that address both certain academic content and certain career and technical education content.

relative humidity ( % ) ; dew point ( c ) ) ; liquid intake and output production . \n chi - squared test was used to evaluate liquid intake versus output production by using spss version 13 . \n descriptive statistics were used to analyse climate data ( temperature ( c ) ; relative humidity ( % ) ; dew point ( c ) ) ; liquid intake and output production . \n chi - squared test was used to evaluate liquid intake versus output production by using spss version 13 . \n 1 shows in situ hourly climate variation direct from the sugarcane fields while workers harvested the crop . \n as can be seen , temperature and relative humidity values oscillated from 23.5 to 34.5c and from 40% to 64% , respectively , reaching maximum values as early as 810 am . \n this meant that water distribution had to be started at around that time on an hourly basis . \n climate measurements during 160 working hours of follow - up for 22 sugarcane workers at the montelimar farm . \n table 2 shows the amount of liquid intake ( including both regular tap water and specially formulated rehydration drinks ) . \n what is of great concern is that , although temperature increased to maximum values early in the morning , many workers did not follow the rehydration measures and drank less than 6 l , a potentially dangerously low volume . \n comparison between temperature measurements and daily water intake for 22 sugarcane workers at the montelimar farm . \n this showed that 13 workers who had the highest production output ( range 68 tons , average 7.45 tons ) were those who drank more than 6 l of liquid ( regular tap water and/or specially formulated rehydration solutions ) in comparison to those who drank less liquid and had a smaller production output . \n relationship between production output and daily water intake for 22 sugarcane workers at the montelimar farm . \n measurements of heart rate and body weight at the start and end of the working day showed that workers experienced increases in heart rate and loss of body weight as they worked in these hot conditions . \n historically , monitoring of toxins in the work environment has been the primary focus for identifying risks . \n some potential biomarkers linked to cell injury are immunological factors , lymphokines , growth factors , prostaglandins , endothelins , collagen , adhesion molecules , thromboxanes , leukotrienes , platelet activating factors and heat shock proteins ( 10 ) . as mentioned earlier , heat illness is a major cause of preventable morbidity worldwide ( 1 ) and although human beings possess considerable ability to compensate for naturally occurring heat stress , many occupational environments and/or physical activities expose workers to heat loads which are so excessive as to threaten their health and productivity ( 11 ) . \n it is important to remember that the normal human body contains approximately 60% of water , \n the present project evaluated climatic conditions at sugarcane plantations located at sea level , on the southwest coast of nicaragua . \n monitored climate indices ( temperature and relative humidity ) values varied from 23.5 to 34.5c and from 40% to 64% , respectively , reaching maximum values as early as 8 am . according to the nicaraguan institute of territorial studies ( ineter ) ( 13 ) , relative humidity values for the whole month of april varied between 69 and 79% all along nicaragua 's pacific coastline from san juan del sur ( southern region ) to chinandega ( western region ) . \n managua lies between the two regions ; the montelimar sugar farm is located 62 km from managua . \n however , the ineter humidity data are quite different from the relative humidity registered on the farm located in western managua . \n temperature data were not available at ineter 's website . although only 22 subjects were followed - up for a short period of time in this study , important results were obtained . \n other authors have shown the relationship between heat stress health effects and the ability to perform different tasks , as well as the increased risk of suffering work - related injuries ( 14 ) . in this study , the workers drank more liquid as temperature values increased to maximum peaks . \n this was part of a rehydration process which was well planned in advance by the company 's decision makers . unlike during past harvesting seasons , when water and rehydration solutions were distributed quite randomly , during this harvesting season cool water and specially formulated drinks were distributed or intended to be distributed to workers , who received 1 l just before they began their working day and then 500 ml every 30 minutes . \n the basis of this principle is that drinking to satisfy thirst is not enough to keep a person well hydrated . \n most of the people become aware of thirst once they have lost 12 l of body water and persons highly motivated to perform hard work may incur losses of 34 l before serious thirst forces them to stop and drink . \n since dehydration reduces the capacity for absorption from the gut , workers must be educated regarding the importance of drinking enough water during work and continuing generous rehydration during off - duty hours ( 14 ) . \n there was a significant increase of production , with up to 8 tons per worker during the follow - up period compared to the normal 5.5 tons per worker prior to the change in rehydration measures . \n this important change in rehydration policies and increase in production output is the result of various efforts of training workers , foremen and managers on heat stress prevention , proper hydration measures and quality of ( working ) life carried out by occupational health and safety professionals ( physicians and engineers ) , human resources departments and top management at sugarcane farms . \n . often workers rejected the new rehydration measures , most of the time because it was difficult for them to understand thoroughly the dehydration and physiological compensatory mechanisms . \n some of the reasons for this can be attributed to their low educational level , and feeling that  nothing bad has ever happened to me before , etc . \n certainly more effort in terms of intervention strategies and scientific investigation needs to be carried out among workers in nicaragua who perform jobs in which they are exposed to high ambient temperatures . \n these include farm workers , construction workers , miners and fishermen , especially those employed in the informal sector , which occupies about half of nicaragua 's economically active population . \n more funds should also be designated by companies decision makers for improving basic working conditions , in order to increase overall productivity ( and workers satisfaction in terms of better wages ) . \n this would also translate into safer and healthier workers , less absenteeism from sick leave , fewer accidents and other incidents . \n the author has not received any funding or benefits from industry to conduct this study .",
      "summary": "backgroundheat illness is a major cause of preventable morbidity worldwide . \n workers exposed to intense heat can become unable to activate compensation mechanisms , putting their health at risk . \n heat stress also has a direct impact on production by causing poor task performance and it increases the possibility of work - related morbidity and injuries . during the sugarcane harvest period , workers are exposed to excessive sunlight and heat from approximately 6 am to 3 pm . \n a first assessment of heat stress during the 2006/2007 harvesting season served to redesign the existing rehydration measures . in this project , \n sugarcane workers were provided with more rehydration solutions and water during their work schedule.objectiveto assess heat stress preventive measures in order to improve existing rehydration strategies as a means of increasing productivity.methodsa small group of 22 workers were followed up for 15 days during working hours , from 6 am to 3 pm . \n selection criteria were defined : to have worked more than 50% of the day 's working schedule and to have worked for at least 10 days of the follow - up period . \n a simple data recollection sheet was used . \n information regarding the amount of liquid intake was registered . \n production output data was also registered . \n temperature measurements were recorded by using a portable temperature monitoring device (  easylog , model el - usb-2).resultsthe average temperature measurements were above the nicaraguan ministry of labour thresholds . \n seven workers drank 78 l of liquid , improving their production . \n output production increased significantly ( p=0.005 ) among those best hydrated , from 5.5 to 8 tons of cut sugarcane per worker per day.conclusionsproductivity improved with the new rehydration measures . \n awareness among workers concerning heat stress prevention was increased .",

The race and the shiny new $3 million stadium that housed it were a reminder of how the financial success of big-time colege athletics has been mimicked by an intramural event.\n\nThe workmen who were here this morning-sawing, drilling and welding the stadium, together-were evedence of what the race is becoming. The old horseshoe stradium in the middle of the campus, the cozy scene of the first 30 races, was replaced by the nearly finished 23,000-seat stadium on the northeast edge. The stadium was built after four donors gave ,2.75 million to the Indiana University Foundation. That, the level of competition and the fact that students had to pay more to see the race than they would to see an Indiana basketball game have led to criticism in the school newspaper and talk around campus that teams break some rules to succeed.\n\nBut when Bill Brissman of Delta Chi started to chase the team from Wilkie Quadrangle with 9 1/2laps to go, and when he went into his final sprint in the fourth turn of the next-to-last lap to lengthen his lead, the energy fron the overflow record crowd of 27,412 was no less than at a final game of the National Collegiate basketball tournament or a Rose Bowl.\n\nWhen Brissman-the rider who lost at the end of the race in the movie crossed the finish line with both arms in the air for his team's third consecutive victory, that feeling was not much different from the one Indiana's basketball team experienced last month when it won the National Collegiate championship.\n\nThe photographers and the television people with hand-held cameras crowded around the riders as the winning bicycle was passed through the crowd, and a banner was unfuried.\n\nIt said, Winning Isn't Everything. It's The Only Thing.\n\nAnd Brissman said, We didn't know we had it until we had it.\n\nThe history of the 200-lap race(50.98 miles)- the centerpiece to what is modestly referred to as the World's Greatest College Weekend - shows that a bicycle race can also reflect student attitudes. Attendance grow quickly in the 1950's. In 1970, when the 20th race was held five days after the deaths of four students at Kent State, protesters outside the stadium held signs that said, No more business as usual.\n\nBut now the word is fun. Preparations have become more elaborate. Riders, and their coaches, refer to the development of their four-man teams the way as the major-sport participants and coaches do.\n\nThe teams of fraternities and other campus housing organizations are called programs. The programs include conditioning schedules and budgets estimated as high as $5,000 and more including funds for equipment, training trips to warm-weather places and special training-table food and vitamins.\n\nThe new stadium will also be used for the university's soccer team and for summer entertainment events, but the race is responsible for the double-deck press box and V.I.P. entertainment area that will be completed next year.\n\nThe university's news bureau issued 140 press credentials to 50 organizations, and the legal question of exclusivity rights was all that prevented network television coverage by ABC, which has a three-year agreement with an option to renew. The Delta Chi team, which had won six of the last eight races before today, has a house member assigned to the task of screening interview requests. Is the Good Time Gone\n\nThe $3 million dollar stadium, a press secretary for intramural riders and network television coverage of a bicycle race have caused some to ask questions.\n\nSomehow, it doesn't seem like a good time anymore, wrote Janet Graham, sports editor of The Indiana Daily Student in a coloumn published Thursday. Are we running this race to satisfy the moneymakers-Foundation-or are we running it for the enjoyment of the students?\n\nIf you understand the bottom line, said Jerry Tardy, a vice president of the Indiana University Foundation, who watched his 29th race today, the bottom line is much bigger than whether Delta Chi wins the Little 500.\n\nThe student staff that organized this race will continue to work for the foundation on the next fund drive. The bottom line last year was this: 28,500 gifts for a total of $15.7 million, Indiana's most successful effort.\n\nThe prizes for the top riders are basically the same as they were 30 years ago, with the No.1 team receiveing gifts and the top 15 winning trophies. The stakes are now much higher than that.\n\nSuccessor failure in the Little 500 can affect a fraternity house just as a varsity team can affect a university. Alumni relations, fundraising and the attraction of new members can become much easier after a victory. The rules prohibit highly ranked riders from intering, there is a limit of four years of eligibility, and a rider who switches teams must skip a race, as varsity athletes must miss one season after they transfer. But there are no regulations to prohibit recruiting or financial aid, since the foundation considers these areas beyond its jurisdiction. Also, the rules would be unenforceable.\n\nWith the stakes so high, continued success could lead to charges of recruiting, tampering and creative financing to attract top riders.

      "summary": "''Breaking Away,'' the movie that made Indiana University's Little 500 bicycle race not more than a local event, was playing at a theatre here this week as a reminder of what that race, held today, once was.  The race and the shiny new $3 million stadium that housed it were a reminder of how the financial success of big-time colege athletics has been mimicked by an intramural event.   The workmen who were here this morning-sawing, drilling and welding the stadium, together-were evedence of what the race is becoming.  The old horseshoe stradium in the middle of the campus, the cozy scene of the first 30 races, was replaced by the nearly finished 23,000-seat stadium on the northeast edge.  The stadium was built after four donors gave ,2.75 million to the Indiana University Foundation.  That, the level of competition and the fact that students had to pay more to see the race than they would to see an Indiana basketball game have led to criticism in the school newspaper and talk around campus that teams break some rules to succeed.",

      "document": "''WE don't ask for life - we have it thrust upon us,'' says Jo, the impoverished, abandoned 18-year-old heroine of Shelagh Delaney's ''A Taste of Honey.'' True enough, but then what does one do? According to Miss Delaney, you don't feel sorry for yourself, you don't cry, you don't even rage at the heavens. You just keep going on, from dark night to dark night, trying to preserve your sense of humor and dignity as best you can.\n\n''A Taste of Honey,'' which caused a sensation in London and New York in the late 1950's, is the latest modern British drama to be revived by the Roundabout. It may be the most worthy excavation of the lot. Though ''Honey'' bears a few dated mannerisms, it holds up much better than most plays of England's look-back-in-anger period. There's a clear-eyed, unsentimental nobility about Miss Delaney's writing that recalls the spirit of Samuel Beckett - even though her naturalistic theatrical style is as far removed from Mr. Beckett as possible. In Tony Tanner's solid production at the Roundabout's intimate Stage II, the play's virtues are unmistakable.\n\nMiss Delaney was 19 when she wrote ''Honey.'' One can only wonder at the wisdom she possessed at that age. She brings equanimity to a sad, apparently autobiographical tale that would send many another writer crashing into bathos and melodrama. Her play's action is all heartbreak, her characters all misfits. The heroine, Jo (Amanda Plummer), is the plain, illegitimate daughter of a long-vanished, mentally defective father and a now aging tart of a mother (Valerie French). The mother goes off to marry a new fancy man, a mean drunk, leaving her daughter alone in a grimy Lancashire tenement. Jo has her own passing fling, with a black sailor, only to be left pregnant. She turns for friendship to a homosexual art student, who is also fated to disappear.\n\nWhen the playwright is establishing this plot in Act I, she relies somewhat on the clunky contrivances of the well-made play. But from the very beginning, she looks at a miserable world with charity and humor. If the mother, Helen, is uncaring about Jo, she is also funny and likable. She knows what she is, and she's just trying to keep her spiritual infection from spreading to her daughter. ''It's your own life - ruin it your own way,'' Helen explains. ''I've certainly supervised my own downfall.''\n\nMiss French, wearing a tacky fake leopard-skin coat and lots of makeup, is doing some of her best work in this role. Her Helen is as much fading vaudevillian as tired tart or selfish mother; the actress brings sharp, double-edged irony to every line. It's a very honest performance. Even when, at the very end, Helen returns briefly to her pregnant daughter, she remains a guiltless, self-absorbed, buoyant woman. The unmawkish Miss French keeps it clear that the mother has come home for her own practical reasons, not because she has suddenly been overwhelmed by latent maternal affection.\n\nIf Miss Delaney is even-handed about the ostensibly villainous Helen, she's every bit as just in her writing of Jo. The daughter is no teary martyr. While she has limited resources to meet the challenges that life hands her, meet them she does. She taunts her mother's boorish new lover with wounding jokes; she tries to laugh off her mother's callousness as an absurd fact of life. Only once, late in the evening, does she give in to convulsions of emotional pain. And it's a brief explosion at that. Without being a Pollyanna, Jo moves on. Maybe her baby will finally introduce her to love - an emotion she has heretofore ''never been too familiar with.''\n\nJo is on stage throughout; it's a highly demanding role for a young actress. Amanda Plummer is more than up to it - she's stunning. With her messily cropped hair, urchin's posture and devilish grin, she looks just right. More to the point, she reinforces the writing's rich texture by providing a heroine who is part girl, part woman, part working-class street fighter. Angry as she is at her mother, she still has sweetness to give to her sailor. When she enters her sisterly relationship with her homosexual pal later on, she becomes a teasing, testing child who, incongruously enough, happens to be carrying a child in her belly.\n\nAs Miss Plummer's sensitive, brotherly playmate, Keith Reddin is an equal match. A forlorn wastrel who has retreated into Jo's apartment to avoid being laughed at, he is brittle, kind and strong as the text requires. Jo and Helen's respective lovers are adequately handled by Tom Wright and John Carroll, but they're not too fully written. Mr. Tanner's energetic direction smartly prevents us from examining Miss Delaney's occasional failings too closely.\n\nIn any case, the minor infelicities of craft are insignificant next to the authentic, full-bodied voice that cries out at us in this work. ''It's not the darkness outside - it's the darkness inside houses I can't stand,'' says Jo in one particularly affecting passage. In ''A Taste of Honey'' Miss Delaney plunges through that frightening darkness until she reaches its very heart.

pupillary distance . \n in total 77 eyes in 40 children aged 2 to 10 years were evaluated in uijeongbu st . \n this study was conducted according to the guidelines of the association for research in vision and ophthalmology and the 1975 declaration of helsinki . \n children were excluded when they had eccentric fixation , optical media opacity , or exceeded the plusoptix s09 manufacturer 's recommendations of a refractive error of a maximum spherical range of 7.00 to + 5.00 d and a pupil size range of 3 to 8  mm . \n the patients were categorized according to 2 methods : ( i ) 11 eyes with hyperopia +3.0 d and 66 eyes with hyperopia < + 3.0 d , emmetropia , and myopia ; ( ii ) 12 eyes with cycloplegic and noncycloplegic refraction of spherical power +2.0 d and 65 eyes with cyclopegic and noncycloplegic refraction of spherical power \n < + 2.0 d. all refractive errors ( spherical power , cylinder power , and spherical equivalent ) were determined in the following order : ( 1 ) photorefraction without cycloplegia using the plusoptix s09 ; ( 2 ) autorefraction without cycloplegia ( noncycloplegic ) using the cannon autorefractometer ( rk - f1 , canon , tokyo , japan ) ; ( 3 ) cycloplegic autorefractometer using 1% cyclopentolate ( 1% cyclogyl ) . \n all cycloplegic autorefractomery was performed within 30  minutes of the use of 1% cyclopentolate 3 times per 5  minutes . \n comparisons between the measurements were performed using paired t - tests and pearson 's correlation analysis . \n all statistical analyses were performed using the spss statistical package 19 ( spss for windows , chicago , il ) . a value of p  <  0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance . \n there was no statistical difference between the 11 eyes with hyperopia of +3.0 d and the 66 eyes with hyperopia of < + 3.0 d , emmetropia and myopia for age and sex . \n in addition , there was no statistical difference between the 12 eyes with cycloplegic and noncycloplegic refraction of spherical power +2.0 d and the 65 eyes with cyclopegic and noncycloplegic refraction of spherical power < + 2.0 d ( table 1 ) . \n there was no difference between the plusoptix s09 and cycloplegic autorefractometer for both spherical power and equivalent in all of the children . \n in contrast , there was a statistical difference between the plusoptix s09 and noncycloplegic autorefractometer ( p  <  0.001 ) ( table 2 ) . \n pearson 's correlations between the plusoptix s09 and cycloplegic autorefractometer for spherical power , cylinder power , and spherical equivalent were 0.748 , 0.893 , and 0.782 , respectively , whereas between the plusoptix s09 and noncycloplegic autorefractometer these were 0.559 , 0.870 , and 0.580 , respectively . \n these results indicate that the spherical power and spherical equivalent determined using the plusoptix s09 correlated more closely with those determined using the cycloplegic autorefractometer than using the noncycloplegic autorefractometer ( table 3 ) . \n although there was no statistical difference between the plusoptix s09 and cycloplegic autorefractometer in the spherical power and spherical equivalent in all of the patients ( table 2 ) , the mean spherical power and equivalent recorded using the plusoptix s09 was 2.91    0.90 d and 2.22    0.93 d , respectively , whereas these recorded using the cycloplegic autorefractometer were 4.66    0.93 d and 4.25    0.80 d in hyperopia of +3.0 d , respectively . \n there was a statistical difference between the plusoptix s09 and cycloplegic autorefractometer for the spherical power and spherical equivalent in hyperopia of +3.0 d ( paired t - test , p  <  0.05 ) . \n in addition , in patients of cycloplegic and noncycloplegic refraction of spherical power +2.0 d , there was a statistical difference between the plusoptix s09 and cycloplegic autorefractometer for the spherical equivalent ( paired t - test , p  =  0.015 ) ( table 4 ) . \n there was significant difference between the plusoptix s09 and cycloplegic autorefractometer according to the scatter plot for spherical power and equivalent in hyperopia of +3.0 d ( fig . \n cpr  =  cycloplegic refraction , se  =  spherical equivalent , sp  =  spherical power . \n amblyopia is the leading cause of decreased vision among children and affects 2% to 5% of the population . \n early diagnosis and treatment may lead to better visual outcomes and decrease the severity and prevalence of amblyopia . because of the importance of early diagnosis , several screening methods for amblyopia are used . \n however , this method is limited because it requires an experienced examiner , is time consuming , and in general needs sedation of children <3 years old with limited co - operation . in contrast \n , the photo refractor is easy to use in examining younger children without the need for cycloplegic drops or sedation . \n although an ideal screening test would have 100% specificity , 100% sensitivity , and 100% positive predictive value , there is no screening method with this level of accuracy . \n many studies have shown the plusoptix to be a rapid , accurate , and noninvasive refractometer in preschool children and in individuals with intellectual or physical disabilities , and it has excellent specificity and sensitivity . \n the mean spherical power and spherical equivalent recorded using the plusoptix s09 were 1.53    2.01 d and 1.33    1.97 d , respectively , whereas using the cycloplegic autorefractometer they were 0.61    2.02 d and 0.73    2.05 d , respectively , in all the children , which were not significantly different between the 2 devices ( paired t - test , p  >  0.05 ) . \n we observed significant pearson 's correlation coefficients of 0.748 , 0.893 , and 0.782 between the plusoptix s09 and cycloplegic autorefractometer for spherical , cylindrical , and spherical equivalent refractive errors , respectively . \n these values are similar to those of 0.76 , 0.86 , and 0.76 , respectively , reported by rajavi et al . \n in contrast , the mean spherical power and spherical equivalent were significantly different using the plusoptix s09 ( 2.91    0.90 d and 2.22    0.93 d , respectively ) and the cycloplegic autorefractometer ( 4.66    0.93 d and 4.25    0.80 d , respectively ) in hyperopia of +3.0 d , ( paired t - test , p  <  0.05 ) . because accommodative capacity leads to a myopic shift in over - moderate hyperopia , a statistical difference between the plusoptix s09 and cycloplegic autorefractometer for the spherical power and equivalent was expected . \n this shift was reported to be 3.0 d and 1.9 d in some children by erdurmus et al and dahlmann - noor et al , respectively . \n schaeffel et al demonstrated a myopic shift of 2.4 d in children wearing + 3.0 d glasses with noncycloplegic photorefraction . in conclusion \n , the plusoptix s09 can provide a rapid and easy method of refraction for amblyopia screening in young children and detecting risk factors for refractive amblyopia . \n however , when it is used to estimate the refractive error in a child with hyperopia of +3.0 d , the refractive error should be corrected after a comparison of the refractive errors of the plusoptix s09 with those of a cycloplegic autorefractometer .",

The consumer release model is expected to cost less than the $1,500 price of the early Explorer edition.\n\nAdditionally, new information suggests the device may be manufactured in the U.S. The Financial Times has reported that \u201cpeople familiar with the company\u2019s plans,\u201d are saying Google is working with Foxconn to assemble a factory in Santa Clara, Calif. When reached by ABC News, Google would not comment on the \u201cmade in the USA\u201d report.\n\nDomestic manufacturing wouldn\u2019t be new territory for the Google.

      "document": "non communicable diseases are taking an epidemic form and will be a major cause of death in developing countries by the year 2020 . \n studies conducted in india show that every second person above 35yrs of age has periodontal pockets and 30% of total teeth extracted after 35yrs of age are due to periodontal disease . as a result of high prevalence of both coronary artery disease ( cad ) and periodontal disease \n framingham heart study has identified a list of classical risk factors ( hypertension , male gender , age , smoking , diabetes mellitus , and obesity ) . \n however , they were not sufficient to account for the etiology of this multifactorial pathological process . \n although major improvements have been made in primary and secondary prevention of major risk factors of cad , it continues to be highly prevalent . \n around 40% cases of atherosclerosis can not be attributed to the classical risk factors . due to these facts \n , there is an increased interest for considering chronic infections as a risk factor for atherosclerosis . as inflammatory mechanisms play a central role in mediating all phases of atherosclerosis and destructive periodontal disease , when left untreated they become a chronic inflammatory condition leading to an increase in local and systemic inflammatory mediators \n periodontal associated inflammatory process contributes to an increase in inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) , c reactive proteins ( crp ) and interleukin- 6 ( il- 6 ) . \n epidemiological studies have associated plasma levels of il-6 and tnf -  with cardio vascular risk factors and have associated il- 6levels with a risk of cad . \n thus , the purpose of this interventional survey was to see the effect of periodontal treatment on levels of serum inflammatory markers crp , tnf- and white blood cell ( wbc ) counts . \n twenty subjects were recruited from the department of cardiology , csm medical university , lucknow , india , for the survey . \n subjects with a chronic generalized periodontitis having coronary artery disease confirmed by clinical findings and ecg as interpreted by a cardiologist were included in the study . \n exclusion criteria included current smoking , smoking within last 6 months , diabetes and acute / chronic systemic diseases ( e.g. influenza , rheumatoid arthritis , copd , or kidney disease ) , antibiotics or anti inflammatory drug administration within the last 2 months , and pregnancy / lactation . \n probing depth was recorded at six sites per tooth ( mesio buccal , mid buccal , disto buccal , mesio lingual , mid lingual , and disto lingual ) . \n the presence or absence of bleeding was recorded using sulcular bleeding index ( sbi , muhlemann and son 1971 ) . \n oral hygiene instructions were given and the subjects were recalled 1 month after the last treatment visit . \n serum high - sensitivity c reactive protein ( hscrp ) was measured by using particle- enhanced turbidimetric assay ( hscrp , latex , cobas , integra 400 plus , roche , basel , switzerland ) . \n tnf-  serum levels were determined by sensitive enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) using commercially available kit ( r and d systems inc , minneapolis , mn , usa ) . \n the plates were read using an automated microplate reader ( bio rad , hercules , california , usa ) . wbc count ( /10 ) was obtained . all the parameters ( pd , \n bop , hscrp , tnf- , wbc counts ) were obtained at the baseline and 1 month post treatment . \n probing depth was recorded at six sites per tooth ( mesio buccal , mid buccal , disto buccal , mesio lingual , mid lingual , and disto lingual ) . \n probing depth was recorded to the nearest millimeter using unc 15 probe . the presence or absence of bleeding \n oral hygiene instructions were given and the subjects were recalled 1 month after the last treatment visit . \n serum high - sensitivity c reactive protein ( hscrp ) was measured by using particle- enhanced turbidimetric assay ( hscrp , latex , cobas , integra 400 plus , roche , basel , switzerland ) . \n tnf-  serum levels were determined by sensitive enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) using commercially available kit ( r and d systems inc , minneapolis , mn , usa ) . \n the plates were read using an automated microplate reader ( bio rad , hercules , california , usa ) . \n all the parameters ( pd , bop , hscrp , tnf- , wbc counts ) were obtained at the baseline and 1 month post treatment . \n serum high - sensitivity c reactive protein ( hscrp ) was measured by using particle- enhanced turbidimetric assay ( hscrp , latex , cobas , integra 400 plus , roche , basel , switzerland ) . \n tnf-  serum levels were determined by sensitive enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) using commercially available kit ( r and d systems inc , minneapolis , mn , usa ) . \n the plates were read using an automated microplate reader ( bio rad , hercules , california , usa ) . \n all the parameters ( pd , bop , hscrp , tnf- , wbc counts ) were obtained at the baseline and 1 month post treatment . \n  \n bop was reduced by 28% and pd was reduced by 41% at the end of 1 month [ table 1 ] . \n data on periodontal disease markers before and after treatment hscrp and wbc levels were significantly reduced post treatment . \n the hscrp , tnf-  levels and wbc counts reduced by 18 , 2 , and 14% , respectively [ table 2 ] . \n the present study was conducted with the purpose of detecting the role of non surgical periodontal therapy in subjects with coronary artery disease . \n the study clearly showed that there was a significant reduction in the levels of serum inflammatory markers ( hscrp and wbc counts ) after periodontal therapy . \n the study is in agreement with the results of previous studies[610 ] that stated a reduction in systemic inflammatory markers of inflammation associated with periodontitis post treatment . in this study , \n bop is an informative parameter to estimate the severity of gingival inflammation as well as the response to treatment , and it is a clinical indicator of disease progression and stability . bop \n 20% of sites is associated with a lower risk for periodontal attachment loss . in the present study \n , bop was significantly reduced 1 month after treatment , and the number of subjects with bop > 20% of sites at baseline was reduced by almost half after therapy . \n similarly , all subjects experienced significant reductions in pd after the treatment . in this study , \n 1month after mechanical therapy , the circulating levels of hscrp and wbc counts significantly reduced in all subjects . \n crp is a prognostic marker for future cardiovascular events . the release of bacteria and proinflammatory mediators such as bacterial endotoxins and cytokines in the bloodstream that causes the release of acute phase reactants ( such as c reactive protein ) leading to increased inflammatory activity in atherosclerotic lesions may represent the link between periodontal infection and cad . \n wbc count , a crude marker of systemic inflammation associated with the prediction of future cardiovascular events also significantly decreased for subjects with cad . \n tnf- has a role in apoptosis , bone resorption , matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) and il- 6 production . \n however , the role of tnf -  remains disputed as several studies have not been able to recognize its association to cardiovascular events . \n also , in our study there was no significant reduction in the levels of tnf- . large sample size is required to justify the association of tnf-. the observation that cardiovascular risk factors might be influenced by periodontitis may have important clinical consequences . \n first , as inflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of various conditions ( metabolic syndrome , bp , vascular health ) . \n the association of mild chronic inflammation with future serious events in observational studies may be influenced by an underlying severe periodontal infection . \n second , periodontitis may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events because of the pro atherogenic changes ( increased cholesterol ) and increased systolic blood pressure induced in affected individuals . \n cigarette smoking represents the major influential factor with regard to the association between periodontal infections and systemic inflammation , and this preliminary investigation raises the hypothesis of a possible interaction of smoking , periodontal infection and systolic blood pressure on systemic health.third , if periodontitis were the major inflammatory stimulus in at least some patients with periodontitis , severe periodontal infections may represent a major etiologic factor for atherosclerosis , metabolic syndrome , and their sequelae . \n still , the causal relationship between periodontitis and cad can not be established as the sample size was small and the role of other risk factors was not explored . \n on the basis of the data obtained , a large scale interventional study could be conducted in future . \n poor oral health is detrimental to systemic health.inflammatory markers are significantly associated with periodontitis.periodontitis is a modifiable risk factor , which can be prevented and treated .",
      "summary": "background : periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition believed to cause a low but long lasting systemic inflammatory reaction which in turn contributes to the development of atherosclerosis . \n recent data suggests that around 40% cases of coronary artery disease remain unaccounted despite the identification of the classical risk factors.objectives:to evaluate the efficacy of non surgical periodontal therapy on the levels of serum inflammatory markers in subjects with chronic periodontitis and known coronary artery disease.materials and methods : twenty subjects with known coronary artery disease ( cad ) were recruited from the department of cardiology , csm medical university , lucknow , india , for this study . \n periodontal disease was measured through the clinical parameters bleeding on probing ( bop ) and probing depth ( pd ) . \n all subjects received non surgical periodontal therapy that included oral hygiene instructions and meticulous scaling and root planing . \n systemic levels of inflammatory markers such as high - sensitivity c reactive proteins ( hscrp ) , tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) , and white blood cell ( wbc ) counts were measured prior to and 1 month after periodontal therapy.results:subjects experienced significant reductions in bleeding on probing ( bop ) and probing depth ( pd ) , indicating improvement in overall periodontal health . in all subjects , high - sensitivity c reactive proteins ( hscrp ) , and wbc counts \n were reduced significantly , ; however , tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) levels showed no statistically significant reduction.conclusion:in this study , periodontal treatment resulted in a significant decrease in bleeding on probing ( bop ) and probing depth ( pd ) , and this treatment lowered the serum inflammatory markers ( hscrp and wbc counts ) in patients with coronary artery disease . \n this may result in a decreased risk for coronary artery disease in the periodontally treated patients .",

old female presented to her primary care physician with complaints of intermittent epigastric pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting . \n her symptoms did not last longer than 15 minutes per episode and had been occurring 2 to 4 times per week for 2 months . \n the patient was given the diagnosis of biliary colic and scheduled for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy . \n at operation , the procedure was initiated with establishment of pneumoperitoneum and the standard two 12-mm and 10-mm trocars in the midline with two 5-mm ports laterally . \n these adhesions were seen as likely evidence of previous gallbladder inflammation despite no such ultrasound findings . \n immediately visible upon retraction of the gallbladder was a thick tissue band covered in omental remnants extending from the area of the common bile duct towards the infundibulum . initially thought to be the cystic duct , the size and path of this structure was not compatible . \n dissection of adhesions revealed the structure to be an aberrant right hepatic artery adherent to the anterior surface of the gallbladder , enveloped in its peri - toneal covering . \n further dissection revealed the cystic artery to branch laterally off this rha over the gallbladder fundus anteriorly ( figure 1 ) . \n the cystic artery was clipped and ligated and the rha was completely freed from the gallbladder . \n the gall - bladder was then able to be retracted superolaterally allowing dissection of the cystic duct . \n the duct was clipped proximally and left open for insertion of cholangio - catherization ( figure 2 ) . \n after the gallbladder was removed , the aberrant rha was readily visible traveling across the gallbladder bed and entering the liver at an unusually anterior location ( figure 3 ) . \n the remainder of the procedure was completed as an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy . the aberrant right hepatic artery ( above right angle dissector ) adherent to the anterior surface of the gallbladder . \n the cystic artery branches off this rha and wraps laterally around the gallbladder towards the infundibulum . with the cystic artery ligated and the right hepatic artery dissected off the gallbladder , the gallbladder was then able to be retracted laterally , allowing for cystic duct identification and ligation for cholangiography . \n after the gallbladder has been removed , the right hepatic artery is elevated with a probe to illustrate its high site of hepatic entry . \n superiorly , the artery has adherent remains of omental tissue residual from the preoperative inflammation and adhesions . \n the origins and paths of both the cystic and right hepatic arteries have several documented anomalies . \n a single cystic artery with a dominant course originating at the flexure of the right hepatic artery within calot 's triangle passing posteromedially to the cystic duct toward the gallbladder neck is most common ( 70% to 80% ) . in approximately 5% of patients , the cystic artery courses outside of calot 's triangle to the gallbladder . \n frequently seen cystic artery variants include double artery ( 15% to 20% ) , cystic artery originating from an aberrant right hepatic artery ( 5% to10% ) , left hepatic artery origin ( 1% to 3% ) , and gastroduodenal artery origin ( 3% to 7% ) . \n studies of hepatic arterial anatomy during liver harvesting for transplantation provide an excellent database documenting anomalies . \n a replaced rha is seen in 15% to 25% of patients , of which the vast majority reveal the rha branching off the superior mesenteric artery . \n other aber - rant rha sources are the gastroduodenal artery , right gastric artery , and aorta . \n while the rha is seen anterior to the junction of the cystic and common bile ducts in a quarter of patients , these pass posteromedially to the gallbladder and cystic duct before entering the liver . while an rha adherent to the cystic duct and gallbladder neck is described amongst the most rare of anomalies , we \n are unaware of any reports of an rha that transverses the entire neck and fundus of the gallbladder before such an anterior hepatic entry . \n inadvertent right hepatic artery ligation in cholecystectomy has been associated with liver ischemia , sometimes warranting hepatic lobectomy . \n an angiographic study would be needed to confirm the origin of this rha and whether it was an accessory rha or a true single aberrant rha  this , however , was not clinically indicated . \n the size of the vessel ( figures 1 and 2 ) alone is sufficient evidence of its significance . \n based on historically observed patterns , this rha was most likely of superior mesenteric origin . \n this case serves as a striking reminder of the variations in extrahepatic biliary and vascular anatomy . \n ligation of this aberrant rha could have led to intraoperative hemorrhage or potential hepatic ischemia .",

      "document": "Congress plays an overarching role in shaping outdoor recreation throughout the nation through legislation and oversight. Congress's role in outdoor recreation resources, policies, and programs often involves the agencies that manage recreation resources on federal lands and waters. However, Congress also has supported crosscutting legislative, analytic, and planning efforts dedicated to outdoor recreation broadly, and it has established programs that facilitate recreation on nonfederal lands. Legislation, hearings, and congressional reports have indicated the significance of outdoor recreation economic activity as a decisionmaking consideration in many contexts, not just those involving federal lands. As Congress continues to debate outdoor recreation issues\u00e2\u0080\u0094including provision of federal resources, planning efforts, and funding\u00e2\u0080\u0094data on the size, distribution, and relative importance of the outdoor recreation economy may inform these debates. In April 2016, the Secretary of the Interior announced that the Department of the Interior would sign a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Commerce to undertake a feasibility study to analyze outdoor recreation's impact on the U.S. economy. The Secretary noted that \"credible data on the tangible economic benefits of public lands\" would be a valuable resource for stakeholders, including Congress, and that the study would count the contributions of the outdoor recreation economy in a \"comprehensive and impartial\" way. Later that year, Congress explicitly authorized these efforts through passage of the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act. In addition to ensuring the availability of economic data on outdoor recreation, the act ensured methodological uniformity with other statistical activities of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) that analyze the economic impact of private industries. The act directed the Secretary of Commerce, acting through BEA, to assess and analyze the outdoor recreation economy of the United States and its contributions to the economy generally. The act required the Secretary to consider employment, sales, and contributions to travel and tourism, in addition to any other items the Secretary considered appropriate. Consequently, BEA developed the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA), an account using the same data and methods as BEA's gross domestic product (GDP) statistics. BEA released the first ORSA prototype statistics for comment in February 2018, and it released the first official ORSA statistics in September 2018. BEA released the most recent ORSA statistics on September 20, 2019. Congress has indicated general approval of the ORSA and directed BEA to develop regional statistics in future years; BEA included state-level prototype statistics in the 2019 release. The House Appropriations Committee also directed the Department of Commerce, in coordination with the agencies of the Federal Recreation Council, to continue to refine the account and to report on the feasibility of identifying amounts allocated by the federal government to outdoor recreation efforts. BEA prepares the ORSA statistics as required by the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Impact Act. The most recent ORSA statistics, released in September 2019, measured the period from 2012 to 2017. The ORSA \"measures the size of the outdoor recreation economy and the link between outdoor recreation and the broader U.S. economy.\" BEA constructed the ORSA by isolating outdoor recreation spending and production from the broader industries and categories that BEA already tracked. BEA compiles data into industry accounts (e.g., retail trade, manufacturing, construction, and others) and uses all this data to calculate gross domestic product (GDP). The ORSA is a satellite account in that it isolates and combines the parts of many individual industries that are related to outdoor recreation. For example, as described by BEA, existing industry accounts show \"the production of all apparel, whereas the ORSA shows the production of apparel used specifically for outdoor recreation activities, such as wetsuits and hiking boots.\" The ORSA divides outdoor recreation activity into core activities and supporting activities. Core activities include the production and purchase of goods and services used directly for outdoor recreation, such as equipment, fuel, concessions, and fees. Supporting activities are defined as goods and services that facilitate access to outdoor recreation activities, such as travel and tourism expenses, local trips, construction, and government expenditures that support outdoor recreation (including local, state, and federal spending). BEA also organizes its statistics using conventional and broad views of outdoor recreation. The conventional activities include \"all recreational activities undertaken for pleasure that generally involve some level of intentional physical exertion and occur in nature-based environments outdoors,\" such as camping, fishing, hiking, and hunting. Other activities include additional activities undertaken for pleasure that occur outdoors that may not meet the conventional definition (i.e., do not require intentional physical exertion or occur in a nature-based setting), such as outdoor concerts and festivals and games and sports fields. The two categories of activities can be combined to generate a broad view of the outdoor recreation economy. BEA calculates the ORSA from the same data used to calculate GDP broadly. \u00c2\u00a0As such, the ORSA is directly comparable to other BEA products, including other satellite accounts, like those for arts and cultural production. In addition, the estimates used to create the ORSA follow internationally recognized standards for national accounting, including creating GDP, value added, and other measures. Thus, in theory, the ORSA results can be compared to other measures of GDP, gross output, and value added, although differing assumptions, data, and methods may influence to what degree other measures are equivalent to ORSA statistics. As described above, the ORSA combines data from many different BEA industries; thus, although very general comparisons can be made, direct comparisons risk double-counting. For example, comparing the size of the ORSA to the size of the apparel industry would be inaccurate, because some value added from the apparel industry is included in the ORSA. According to the ORSA statistics, in 2017, the current-dollar value added of the outdoor recreation economy was $427 billion. The outdoor recreation economy accounted for 2.2% of GDP. As shown in Figure 1 , supporting activities, such as construction and travel and tourism expenses, accounted for approximately half of outdoor recreation value added in 2017, approximately $213.9 million current dollars. Conventional outdoor recreation accounted for 30.7% of value added. Other recreation accounted for 19.3%. BEA organizes its accounts by industry. BEA reports that the arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services industry was the largest contributor to the outdoor recreation economy in 2017, accounting for $112.9 billion of current-dollar outdoor recreation value added. The second-largest industry in 2017 was retail trade, accounting for $95.7 billion of current-dollar value added. Figure 2 provides a full breakdown of contribution to value added by industry. BEA reported that the outdoor recreation economy generated approximately 5.1 million jobs in 2017. The arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services industry was the largest industry included in the ORSA for both compensation ($67.3 billion current dollars) and employment (2.1 million) in 2017. Retail trade was the second-largest industry for both compensation ($49.8 billion current dollars) and employment (1.6 million) in 2017. The largest amount of value added in 2017 from an individual conventional outdoor recreation activity (as defined by BEA) came from boating/fishing, accounting for approximately $21\u00c2\u00a0billion in current-value dollars, or approximately 5% of value added from outdoor recreation (see Figure 3 ). The activities that generated the most value added are not necessarily the most popular, according to an FS participation survey. For example, although equestrian activities were among the six largest activities in terms of value added, an FS survey found that equestrian activities were among the three smallest activities for number of participants (see \" National Outdoor Recreation Participation \" for more information). Although much of the economic activity tracked by BEA to calculate value added can be linked to a specific activity (see \" About the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account \"), some economic activity cannot. For example, multiuse apparel and accessories (such as backpacks, bug spray, and other items) that can be used for many activities accounted for approximately $48.6 billion in current dollars, or over 11% of value added. In real terms, the outdoor recreation economy grew 3.9% between 2016 and 2017, faster than the 2.4% growth for the overall U.S. economy. Real gross output, compensation, and employment all grew faster in the outdoor recreation economy than in the overall economy in 2017. Between 2012 and 2017, the outdoor recreation economy grew by approximately 9.9%. In 2017, BEA released prototype statistics on the percentage of each state's GDP from outdoor recreation (see Figure 4 ). BEA's preliminary results found that Hawaii, Montana, Maine, Vermont, and Wyoming had the five highest proportions of state GDP from outdoor recreation. However, other measures of economic importance vary considerably by state. For example, California, Florida, and Texas had the highest total outdoor recreation value added. Wyoming, Hawaii, and Alaska and Maine (tied) had the highest percentage of state employment from outdoor recreation. The relative importance of recreation in individual states depends on the size of the outdoor recreation economy, the state's economy generally, and the state's employment and compensation patterns. It is unclear to what extent these estimates may change if BEA adjusts its methods for calculating state statistics. Official state statistics are scheduled for release in fall 2020. Other Estimates of Economic Activity In addition to the estimates created by BEA, researchers, advocacy groups, and industry associations create estimates of the outdoor recreation economy. Many groups estimate impacts of individual activities, sectors, geographic areas, or outdoor recreation areas (e.g., angling, winter snow sports, a given watershed, or a given state). The broadest of these is the Outdoor Industry Association's (OIA's) Outdoor Recreation Economy report, which has been produced annually since 2006. Prior to publication of the ORSA, OIA estimates were sometimes cited to gauge the size of the outdoor recreation economy as a whole. According to OIA's 2017 report, the outdoor recreation economy generated $887 billion in consumer spending, the majority of which ($702 billion) was trip and travel spending, including airfare, lodging, fuel, groceries, tickets, lessons, guides, and other unspecified expenses spent anywhere away from home. OIA estimates that the outdoor recreation economy directly supports 7.6 million jobs. OIA also estimates that the outdoor recreation economy generates $65.3 billion in federal tax revenue and $59.2 billion in state and local tax revenue. OIA's estimates of the size of the outdoor recreation economy, and other estimation efforts, cannot be directly compared to the ORSA. This may be due to differences in method, assumptions, measurement, or statistics reported. Specifically, the OIA reports measure consumer spending and tax revenue, which are not part of the ORSA and are not directly comparable to any statistic reported in the ORSA. OIA's estimate of jobs (7.6 million) is higher than BEA's estimate of jobs (5.2 million), but it is unclear to what extent the data reported are similar in measurement or whether they represent the same year. BEA excluded exports and imports in its calculation, and these figures may be captured in OIA's statistics. BEA states that external reports on the outdoor recreation economy that include \"activities with a high share of spending on imported goods and services (such as apparel) will likely have higher estimates than the ORSA.\" BEA also states that other reports may include spending on items not used for outdoor recreation (for example, bicycles used for commuting). In general, because other reports do not give the same statistics as the ORSA, and due to methodological differences, it is unclear whether (and to what degree) the ORSA and other reports may or may not be in disagreement, despite apparent large differences in results. The results of the ORSA and OIA reports have certain broad commonalities. For example, both reports find that large amounts of economic activity are driven by activities requiring relatively expensive purchases, such as vehicles (for example, boating or off-highway vehicle activities). Both reports also find that expenses related to travel, such as lodging, airfare, and food away from home, constitute large shares of the economic activity generated by outdoor recreation. According to one source, measures of national trends in outdoor recreation participation are based primarily on the National Survey on Recreation and the Environment (NSRE), a population-based survey conducted by the U.S. Forest Service (FS), sampling all areas of the country and participation in 17 outdoor activities. The NSRE measures both participation (the number of respondents who report engaging in the activity at least once over the course of a year) and consumption (the number of times the respondent indicates engaging in the activity). The survey does not estimate the total number of participants in outdoor recreation generally, only participation rates in the 17 activities studied. The most recent NSRE was completed for the period 1999-2009, and an update is ongoing. The NSRE estimated that, for the activities considered, a maximum of 194 million people (visiting developed sites) and a minimum of 8 million people (primitive skiing) participated every year (see Table 1 for additional details). FS estimated that approximately 82% of NSRE respondents participated in visiting developed sites, the activity with the highest participation rate. In terms of the frequency with which participants engaged in each activity (shown as \"Activity Days\" in Table 1 ), FS estimated that participants engaged in the most popular activity (viewing nature) over 32.4 billion times; this activity, however, is a major outlier, and participants engaged in the next several most popular activities between 8.3 billion and 1.8 billion times. Between 1999 and 2009, FS estimated that participation in nature-based outdoor recreation generally increased. The number of U.S. participants in the surveyed activities increased by 7.1% over this period. Certain activities, such as those oriented toward viewing and photographing nature, off-highway vehicle activities, and several physically challenging activities (e.g., kayaking, snowboarding, surfing) had relatively large increases in participation compared to the average over this period. More people overall participate in outdoor recreation in the eastern United States than in the western United States, in large part because most of the U.S. population resides in the East. However, participation rates (measured as the number of participants per hundred people) are higher in the West for all activities except hunting and fishing. In addition to this broad trend, demographic factors, such as population size, age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, and income, are correlated with the rate of outdoor recreation. For example, relative to the general population, people engaging in hunting and fishing are more likely to be rural residents, and people engaging in skiing and snowboarding are more likely to be urban residents. Availability of and proximity to recreation settings also are highly correlated with the rate of outdoor recreation participation. The amount of recreation that occurs on lands of differing ownership\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, federal, state, local, and private\u00e2\u0080\u0094likely varies widely by activity and location (see section on \" Recreation Visits to Federal Lands \" for further discussion of recreation on federal lands). Approximately 60% of lands in the United States are privately owned, and approximately 28% of the total land area is federally owned; the remainder is in a mix of state, local, tribal, and other ownerships. Over 92% of federal land is located in 11 western states and Alaska. The uneven distribution of federal land between the eastern and western United States influences what lands provide outdoor recreation opportunities in different regions of the United States, particularly given that, for some federal land management agencies, at least half of visits to the properties they administer come from people who live within 50 miles. FS found that private lands were a more important recreation setting in the East, with the total number of recreation visits on private lands in the East nearly four times the number in the West. In the West, respondents reported that they spent the majority of activity days in all surveyed activities on publicly owned lands of any kind. In contrast, respondents in the East spent the majority of activity days in some surveyed activities on private lands and some on publicly owned lands. The ORSA statistics measures the state of the outdoor recreation economy generally. From the standpoint of public lands management, there is often congressional interest in how the government's provision of recreational opportunities translates into economic activity in communities around federal recreation resources. Legislation, hearings, and congressional reports have indicated the significance of this economic activity as a policy consideration in contexts involving federal lands. In the past decade, federal agencies and interagency groups have conducted studies measuring economic contributions specific to federal lands. Because these studies examine multiple agencies under a single framework, and because they report value added, the results are comparable to one another. In the sense that value added is a consistent concept, they also may be generally comparable to other measures of value added, such as the ORSA results, although differences in methods, data, and assumptions mean any comparison can be, at best, highly general. According to these studies, in FY2017 dollars, visitors spent approximately $54 billion in the local economies of federal recreation areas in FY2012 and $49.8 billion in FY2016, generating $55 billion in value added in FY2012 and $53.9 billion in value added in FY2016 (see Table 2 ). The studies indicate that outdoor recreation on federal lands directly supported 880,000 jobs in FY2012 and 826,000 jobs in FY2016. The authors of the studies in Table 2 limited their studies of visitor spending to areas within 50 miles of the federal recreation site. The authors state that this limitation provides a conservative estimate. Although research suggests that many visits to federal recreation sites do indeed originate from nearby, the nationwide estimates discussed above (see \" The National Outdoor Recreation Economy \") indicate that a large proportion of economic activity derives from travel-related expenses. If the travel-related portion of economic activity related to federal sites is not being captured in these results because that activity occurs more than 50 miles from the federal recreation site, these studies may undercount the true value. Similarly, results of national studies indicate that activities requiring major purchases (e.g., vehicles) account for a large proportion of the outdoor recreation economy. If visitors do not report such expenditures, it also may result in undercounting. The agencies used different methods to measure visitation and economic activity; thus, estimates may be only generally comparable. Federal lands comprise approximately 640 million acres in the United States, about 28% of the total land area. Approximately 92% (573 million acres) of federal lands are located in 11 western states and Alaska, with over one-third (224 million acres) of all federal land in Alaska alone. The Forest Service (FS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manage the majority of federal land. Nearly all federal land is open and available to the public for recreation. Although there is considerable overlap in the recreation opportunities across agencies, some agencies could be considered to have dominant niches. FS and BLM offer a range of opportunities, from camping, picnicking, and birdwatching in developed settings to activities in undeveloped backcountry, motorized recreation, and others. Opportunities on Fish and Wildlife Service land emphasize wildlife, fish, and birds. The National Park Service (NPS) is associated with \"iconic natural and cultural resources.\" Opportunities on land owned by the Bureau of Reclamation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) tend to center on water and underwater resources. Although some agencies' resources are used mostly by locals, all agencies have resources with regional, national, or international markets. Table 3 presents information from various sources on recreation visits to federal lands from FY2012 to FY2017. In general, these statistics are not comparable to the NSRE estimates given above due to differences in measurement. The statistics indicate that, in general over this period for agencies with complete data, FS and NPS had the most visits. These statistics underscore that size and location are imperfect predictors of recreation resource use; USACE, for example, has higher visitation than several agencies that manage more federal land area. These differences may be due to proximity to population centers, the types of resources available on different lands, and other factors. ",
      "summary": "Congress plays an overarching role in shaping outdoor recreation throughout the nation through legislation and oversight. As Congress continues to debate outdoor recreation issues\u00e2\u0080\u0094including provision of federal resources, planning efforts, and funding\u00e2\u0080\u0094data on the size, distribution, and relative importance of the outdoor recreation economy may inform these debates. Both historical and recent legislative and executive efforts centered on outdoor recreation have identified the economic importance of outdoor recreation. In 2016, Congress passed the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act ( P.L. 114-249 ), which directed the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the Department of Commerce to create an account that would measure the outdoor recreation economy. BEA released the first official Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA) statistics in September 2018 and updated them in September 2019. According to the ORSA statistics, in 2017, the current-dollar value added of the outdoor recreation economy was $427\u00c2 billion, or 2.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). ORSA statistics show that supporting activities, such as construction and travel and tourism expenses, accounted for approximately half of value added. Conventional outdoor recreation activities, as defined by BEA, accounted for another 30.7% of real outdoor recreation gross output; o ther recreation accounted for 19.3%. The outdoor recreation economy grew by 3.9% in 2017, faster than the 2.4% growth for the overall U.S. economy, and has grown approximately 9.9% since 2012. Real gross output, real compensation, and real employment all grew faster in the outdoor recreation economy than in the overall economy in 2016. BEA reports that the \"arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services industry\" was the largest contributor to the outdoor recreation economy in 2017, accounting for $112.9 billion of current-dollar outdoor recreation value added, followed by retail trade. These two sectors were also the largest industries included in the ORSA statistics for both compensation ($67.3 billion) and employment (2.1 million) in 2017. BEA released prototype statistics for states, which found that Hawaii, Montana, Maine, Vermont, and Wyoming had the five highest proportions of state GDP generated from outdoor recreation in 2017. In addition to the ORSA statistics, which are measured for the nation as a whole or for individual states, federal agencies sometimes measure the specific economic impact of federal lands. According to some studies, visitors to federal lands generated $55 billion in value added in FY2012 and $53.9 billion in value added in FY2016 (FY2017 dollars). Differences in methods, data, and assumptions mean any comparison between these figures and the ORSA statistics can be highly general at best. It is difficult to precisely measure the total amount of outdoor recreation that Americans engage in, due to differences in data collection, measurement, definitions, and other factors between sources. One source, the National Survey on Recreation and the Environment (NSRE), measures the number of people who engage in 17 different outdoor activities and how often they do so. According to the NSRE, over 194 million respondents (approximately 82% of respondents) engage in the most popular form of outdoor recreation (visiting developed sites) in a given year. Americans report engaging in the most popular surveyed activity, viewing nature, over 32.4 billion times in a given year, although this activity is a major outlier. Rates of participation in surveyed activities vary substantially and can depend on geographic location, proximity to recreation resources, demographic factors, and other influences. In FY2017, lands managed by the four federal land management agencies (the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, and National Park Service) had approximately 596 million visits. Lands managed by other federal agencies (the Bureau of Reclamation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and United States Army Corps of Engineers) also had significant visitation. Visits to the lands of these other agencies sometimes exceeded visits to lands managed by the four federal land management agencies. Although publicly owned lands (including federal lands) generally have the greatest amount of recreation visits, private lands can dominate certain types of recreation, particularly in the eastern United States.",

      "document": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Quality Incentive Act of \n1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Recent research on early brain development reveals that \n        much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and \n        nurturing care. Research also shows that quality early care and \n        education leads to increased cognitive abilities, positive \n        classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of long-term \n        school success, and greater likelihood of long-term economic \n        and social self-sufficiency.\n            (2) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including \n        6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day in \n        child care. However, a study in 4 States found that only 1 in 7 \n        child care centers provide care that promotes healthy \n        development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care that \n        threatens the safety and health of children.\n            (3) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $10,000 per \n        year.\n            (4) Although Federal assistance is available for child \n        care, funding is severely limited. Even with Federal subsidies, \n        many families cannot afford child care. For families with young \n        children and a monthly income under $1,200, the cost of child \n        care typically consumes 25 percent of their income.\n            (5) Payment (or reimbursement) rates, the maximum the State \n        will reimburse a child care provider for the care of a child \n        who receives a subsidy, are too low to ensure that quality care \n        is accessible to all families.\n            (6) Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care \n        children get and whether families can find quality child care \n        in their communities. In many instances, low payment rates \n        force child care providers to cut corners in ways that lower \n        the quality of care for children, including reducing number of \n        staff, eliminating staff training opportunities, and cutting \n        enriching educational activities and services.\n            (7) Children in low quality child care are more likely to \n        have delayed reading and language skills, and display more \n        aggression toward other children and adults.\n            (8) Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child \n        care as child care providers are able to attract and retain \n        qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional \n        training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and purchase \n        basic supplies and developmentally appropriate educational \n        materials.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the quality of, \nand access to, child care by increasing child care payment rates.\n\nSEC. 3.

Eddie Moore of the Hamilton County Sheriff's Department.\n\nBut he said the items also could have been destroyed by the intense blaze. Officials would not say what evidence they have that the fire was deliberately set.\n\nThe ruins were searched by dogs trained to sniff accelerants like gasoline. Debris collected over several days was tested by a private laboratory.\n\n\"I cannot say what evidence [the dogs] found, but at several locations throughout the house they indicated the possibility of something there,\" Moore said.\n\nThe estate included a gazebo, basketball court and tennis court. The 14,000-square-foot house featured a library, walnut parquet floors and a garden room with a 30-foot ceiling.\n\nLt. Chad Abel said the lack of fire hydrants anywhere near the estate slowed firefighters' efforts.

PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that Federal funding is \nprovided to support and sustain the longstanding Federal mandate \nrequiring Fort Lewis College in the State of Colorado to waive tuition \ncharges for each Indian student it admits to an undergraduate program, \nincluding the waiver of tuition charges for Indian students who are not \nresidents of the State of Colorado.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Fort Lewis College in the State of Colorado is a \n        signature school for Indian students from throughout the Nation \n        and graduates more Indian students than any other baccalaureate \n        institution of higher education;\n            (2) in 2009, Fort Lewis College awarded 95 degrees in \n        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to Indian \n        students, representing 13.5 percent of degrees awarded by \n        baccalaureate institutions of higher education to Indian \n        students, more degrees than any other comparable baccalaureate \n        institution in the Nation;\n            (3) as of the 2010-11 academic year, Fort Lewis College \n        provides federally mandated tuition-free education to \n        approximately 786 Indian students from 124 different Indian \n        tribes and 34 different States, representing approximately 20 \n        percent of the overall student population at this non-tribal \n        institution of higher education that serves Indian students;\n            (4) the Federal mandate to provide tuition-free education \n        to Indian students was first placed upon the State of Colorado \n        under section 5 of the Act of April 4, 1910 (36 Stat. 273, \n        chapter 140), as a condition of the transfer of the land, \n        buildings, and fixtures comprising Fort Lewis School, which had \n        been federally operated;\n            (5) the amount of funds expended by the State of Colorado \n        to meet the waiver of tuition obligations under section 5 of \n        the Act of April 4, 1910 (36 Stat. 273, chapter 140), for all \n        Indian students, both out-of-State and in-State, far exceeds \n        the value of the land, buildings, and fixtures that the State \n        of Colorado holds for the benefit of Fort Lewis College;\n            (6) the State of Colorado has expended more than \n        $110,000,000 in the past 25 years to meet the costs of the \n        tuition waivers for Indian students at Fort Lewis College from \n        44 different States; and\n            (7) the federally mandated tuition waiver program for \n        Indian students at Fort Lewis College is at risk of being \n        reduced by the severe budget constraints of the State of \n        Colorado, thereby jeopardizing the education of many talented \n        Indian students from around the Nation, in present and future \n        classes.\n\nSEC. 3.

specific symptoms at presentation and the often equivocal results of standard first line investigations all contribute to diagnostic difficulty . \n endoscopic and endosonographic images in glomus tumors of the stomach show a solid , submucosal tumor with or without ulceration and do not differentiate it from other important diagnoses , e.g. gist , neuro - endocrine neoplasia ( carcinoid ) , angiomyoma or lymphoma . hence , presurgical diagnostic confirmation is often impossible \n . only immunohistochemical analysis of representative biopsies ( gist : positive reaction with cd-117 antibodies and missing expression of glomus tumor typical actin / vimentin ) can confirm the diagnosis , and hence aid the clinician in determining appropriate therapy and prognosis [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] . \n compounding pre - surgical diagnostic difficulties , there have also been reports of malignant transformation of glomus tumor . \n therefore , surgery or en bloc endoscopic enucleation is in most cases the remaining diagnostic and therapeutic option [ 12 , 13 ] . \n a definite immunohistochemical confirmation of the diagnosis is essential , because the prognosis of a potentially malignant lesion is otherwise unpredictable . in the case \n presented , a patient with recurring epigastric pain and melaena , there was an endoscopic and endosonographic finding of a submucosal tumor of the gastric antrum . \n given the non - diagnostic biopsy result and the ongoing risk of gastrointestinal bleeding , endoscopically assisted laparoscopic wedge - resection of the stomach was performed as a combined diagnostic and therapeutic procedure . \n histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the resected tissue showed an entirely removed ( ro ) glomus tumor . unlike gist , if complete removal of a benign glomus tumor ( ro ) is verified histologically , there is no indication for further specific therapy [ 14 , 15 ] . \n sonographic ( for solid organs ) and endoscopic follow - up for early detection of recurrence or metastasis constitutes the most reasonable postoperative follow - up .",

associated side effects because of the smaller treated volumes [ 2 , 6 , 811 ] . \n however , in this method , the precise target definition and implant quality are crucial for accurate and conformal delivery of the prescribe dose to the ptv with simultaneous sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk ( lung at the treated side and skin ) [ 2 , 3 , 6 , 10 ] . \n a pre - planning procedure which involves different imaging modalities facilitates the localization of the target and provides guidance for implant parameters ( template size , number of planes and catheters ) . \n orthogonal films ( 2d imaging ) and ct simulation ( 3d imaging ) are the guidance techniques which can be used to assure the appropriate catheter position with respect to the marked lesion . in our institute , \n 2d pre -

planning procedure was employed in each group . in the first group the 2d x - ray imaging system ibu - d ( integrated brachytherapy unit by nucletron b.v . ) \n fluoroscopic films were taken before insertion of needles to evaluate the location of the surgical clips and after the implantation procedure to assess the geometric quality of the implant . in the second group \n the 3d pre -

planning than for 2d ( 91.7% vs. 86.1% ) . \n the dose that covers 90% of the ptv ( d90 ) is also higher for 3d pre - planning than for 2d ( 4.2 gy vs. 3.6 gy ) . \n a similar relation can be observed for the values of dose homogeneity index where dhi obtained for 3d pre -

planning were used \n ct - guided implantation allowed the needles to be inserted precisely with respect to the target volume . \n improvement in implant quality increases the dose distribution conformity and homogeneity without extensive use of the optimization algorithms . \n insufficient implant quality may result in lower ptv coverage which needs to be improved with optimization . \n modification of the dwell times may produce overdose areas inside the treated volume ; it reduces the homogeneity of the dose distribution and influences the cosmesis . in brachytherapy planning it \n is highly recommended to deliver at least the prescribed dose to the target with acceptable homogeneity of the dose distribution . \n however , in some situations planning involves finding a balance between homogeneity and sufficient coverage . \n the results of this study show that replacing the 2d pre - planning method with the 3d one seems to be the right solution , resulting in higher values of target coverage and dose homogeneity index simultaneously . \n their study showed a significant increase of all dosimetric parameters when the traditional implantation technique under fluoroscopic guidance was changed to a ct - guided method . \n in the cancer centre in gliwice , apbi with hdr multicatheter implants was introduced in may 2006 . to reach the dosimetric and volumetric goals we are still trying to improve our procedure . \n first we replaced 2d planning with ct - based treatment planning , then 3d pre - planning was introduced into apbi practice . \n the analysis presented in this paper shows that the 3d pre - planning method improves the geometric quality of the implant , which benefits the dosimetry .",

      "document": "ectopic pregnancy ( ep ) is a pregnancy in which fertilized ovum implants other than the endometrial lining of the uterus . \n incidence of ep ranges between 0.25% to 2% of all pregnancies . in 95% of eps , \n fertilized ovum implants in the tubes , but rarely in other organs like abdomen , ovaries , cervix , spleen , omentum , cessarian section scar , and intramural . \n the death rate is about 1 per 2000 eps and 15% of all maternal deaths . \n incidence of ep is nearly double in black women who also have a four times greater risk of ep - related mortality than white women . \n the risk factors for ep include pelvic inflammatory disease , previous tubal surgery , previous tubal pregnancy , progestin contraceptive , assisted reproduction , ovulation induction , induced abortion , salpingitis isthmica nodosa , smoking , and diethyl stilbestrol exposure . \n most of the tubal pregnancies become symptomatic within 12 weeks , but a small number of them progress beyond this gestation and are diagnosed late . \n proper management of ep needs early diagnosis , resuscitation , timely treatment , and follow - up . \n early diagnosis of ep is a difficult task but can be possible with the help of quantitative -human chorionic gonadotropin ( -hcg ) level , transvaginal ultrasonography , and laparoscopy . \n knowledge of the risk factors for ep helps in rapid diagnosis and could reduce the need for surgery and suggest actions to improve prognosis . \n however , several studies assessing risk factors for ep have been published from developed countries . \n saudi women have different characteristics , like cultural , religious , sociodemographic , sexual behavior , beliefs , and contraception practices , than those of developed countries and may have different risk factors for ep . \n the purpose of this study was to highlight the frequency and predisposing factors of ep , and to elucidate the outcome after different treatment modalities in a general hospital . \n this retrospective descriptive study was conducted at hera general hospital , makkah , saudi arabia , over a duration of 18 months from july 1 , 2009 to december 31 , 2010 . \n the study subjects included all females in their reproductive age who were admitted at the obstetrics and gynaecology department with suspicion of ep . \n data were retrieved from the medical record office by exploring the patients files in detail . \n patients files were looked for age ; gravidity ; gestational age ; clinical presenting features ; and ep risk factors , like history of previous abortion , infertility treatment , current use of intrauterine contraceptive device ( iucd ) , history of previous tubal surgery and pelvic surgery , previous ectopic and/or pelvic inflammatory disease . \n peak level of -hcg , transvaginal ultrasonographic findings , mode of treatment , and type of surgical procedure were also retrieved . a woman experiencing several eps during the study period generated multiple case entries , one for each ep episode . in this study , seven women experienced two , and two women experienced three eps . \n the duration from symptoms onset to admission and admission to definite treatment was also recorded . \n numerical data were subjected to descriptive analysis , with mean  standard deviation ( sd ) . \n the institutional review board of hera general hospital , makkah , saudi arabia , granted us permission to conduct this study . \n the institutional review board of hera general hospital , makkah , saudi arabia , granted us permission to conduct this study . \n incidence was 0.58% out of 7654 pregnant women admitted at the department of obstetrics and gynaecology ( 5.8/1000 pregnancies ) . \n the mean age of the women was 27.9  7 years and only 2 ( 4.5% ) were more than 40 years old . \n twenty - five ( 56.8% ) were multigravida whereas 21 ( 47.7% ) presented at 7 - 8 weeks of gestation . \n the range of gestational age was 3 - 9 weeks at presentation . only 24 ( 54.5% ) patients presented within 24 h , 6 patients within 1 - 2 days , and 14 patients presented after 2 days of onset of symptoms of ep . \n the most common presenting feature was amenorrhea ( 41 , 93.2% ) , followed by abdominal pain ( 39 , 88.6% ) and abdominal tenderness ( 38 , 86% ) . \n fluid in pouch of douglas was found in 21 ( 55.3% ) cases and ectopic mass in 13 ( 34.2% ) cases [ tables 1 and 2 ] . \n demography and obstetrical history clinical presentation of ectopic pregnancy sixteen ( 36.3% ) females presented with hemoglobin levels of 8 - 10 gm% , followed by 13 ( 29.5% ) with  10 - 12 gm% , 9 ( 20.5% ) with  12 - 14 gm% , and 6 ( 13.6% ) with  8 gm% . twenty - three ( 52.3% ) patients did not receive any blood transfusion during their hospital stay , but 11 patients received one , 5 received two , 3 received three , and 2 patients received  4 units of blood transfusion . out of 44 patients , \n 25 underwent emergency laparotomy whereas the remaining 19 patients were admitted for observation and further diagnosis . \n when diagnosis was proved , 12 underwent laparoscopy whereas seven received medical treatment by methotrexate ( mtx ) and it was successful in all cases . on the other hand , salpingectomy was performed in 33 ( 89.1% ) cases followed by salpingostomy in 2 ( 5.4% ) , whereas one case underwent salpingotomy and resection of ectopic mass was performed for the remaining one patient . \n pre - operative findings for 37 cases revealed that 35 ( 94.6% ) females had ep in the fallopian tube , whereas one case had within the ovary and one had heterotopic pregnancy , i.e. , combined intra- and extra - uterine . \n average hospital stay after surgery was 4 days in laparotomy and 2 days in laparoscopy . \n eighty percent ( n = 35 ) had some risk factors , whereas previous pelvic surgery was most frequently seen ( 13 , 29.5% ) followed by history of pelvic inflammatory disease ( 10 , 22.7% ) [ table 3 ] . \n the rate of ep was 1.9% as reported by lozeau and potter in usa , and 1.04% and 1% by bangash and ahmad , and waseem , respectively , in pakistan . \n our study was conducted in a secondary healthcare center , which is why we were not receiving referral cases from the whole of the makkah region , and incidence represented the incidence in hera general hospital rather than the general population of the region . \n mtx treatment of ep was safe and effective for selected patients with unruptured tubal ep , with no major side effects as found by dhar et al . \n a paper presented in a conference proceeding highlighted management of advanced ep , i.e. , in bahrain , managements of ep were as follows : laparotomy and salpingectomy ( 84.2% and 5.3% ) , mtx alone ( 5.3% ) and mtx followed by laparotomy and salpingectomy ( 10.5% ) , whereas in qatar it was laparoscopy and salpingectomy ( 77.6% ) , mtx alone ( 19.4% ) , and mtx followed by laparoscopy and salpingectomy ( 3% ) . \n laparoscopy in qatar and laparotomy in bahrain were the treatment of choice to treat advance ectopic cases . \n lozeau and potter reported a success rate of 88% in a single - dose versus 93% in a multiple - dose regimen of mtx . \n salpingostomy was concluded as a better option than salpingectomy regarding the future fertility outcome in one study . \n we tried in our study to increase the clinical knowledge and the degree of suspicion of the physicians to diagnose the ep as early as possible . \n this will avoid delay in presentation and diagnosis , which is vital to avoid morbidity and mortality in patients with ep . \n after a review of the literature and our study results , we are in a position to recommend the following steps at three levels i.e. , public , primary healthcare , and specialist center . \n aim should be early diagnosis and prompt treatment of ep without unnecessary delay in presentation , diagnosis , and treatment . \n we should launch a public awareness program about the risk factors to educate all females through electronic media like tv , radio , or newspapers . \n all these patients should register themselves at a specialist hospital for care of their pregnancy where specialist gynecologists and facilities for diagnosis and treatment of ep are available . \n general practitioners working in primary healthcare centers should be educated to have a high index of suspicion for ep . at specialist - level hospitals , all females ( at their child - bearing age ) presenting with hemodynamic instability or pain in the lower abdomen should be admitted and immediate investigations like pregnancy test , -hcg , and ultrasound ( both trans - abdominal and trans - vaginal ) should be ensured even if there is no history of amenorrhea . \n this study found that previous pelvic surgery , infertility treatment , and pelvic inflammatory disease were the major predisposing factors for ep . \n the most common site was the fallopian tube and the success rate of mtx was found to be 100% . \n to avoid emergency laparotomy that has its own post - operative complications , timely diagnosis of ep should be encouraged .",

      "document": "suprapubic cystostomies are performed for a variety of indications that require either temporary or permanent placement of suprapubic catheters . \n the placement of percutaneous suprapubic catheters using a punch trocar technique involves some risks and should not be considered an innocuous procedure . among the wide variety of complications , the most serious complication is bowel injury . \n bowel injuries include perforation of the ileum [ 2 - 6 ] and colon   as well as small bowel obstruction and volvulus [ 3,7 - 9 ] . \n because the percutaneous tract is blindly made at 3 to 4 cm above the symphysis pubis in the midline , the risk of bowel injury is constantly present . \n therefore , before a percutaneous cystostomy is performed , especially if there has been prior abdominal or pelvic surgery , or if the bladder is not full , it is strongly advised to consider using ultrasound for the detection of interposed bowel along the percutaneous tract , because the bowel may be in close proximity to the tract . however \n , that method does not totally guarantee the nonexistence of bowel crossing the tract , because it may be difficult for the ultrasound to detect a collapsed bowel . despite this clinical setting , \n there has been little study of the risk factors for bowel injury associated with percutaneous cystostomy . \n this may be largely due to the practical limitations in demonstrating bowel injury before and after suprapubic cystostomy . in this study \n , we investigated the risk factors for possible bowel interposition between the bladder and the skin at the routine puncture site of suprapubic cystostomy by computed tomography ( ct ) , assuming that a hypothetical suprapubic cystostomy was performed . \n we retrospectively reviewed 795 consecutive adult abdominopelvic ct scans performed for various reasons in our hospital from september to october 2009 . among them , we selected 226 patients whose bladders were distended more than 6 cm above the upper margin of the symphysis pubis . \n their medical charts at the time of the ct scan were analyzed retrospectively . through the ct scan images \n , we determined whether the bowel was interposed between the urinary bladder and the skin at a point along the midline of the abdomen , 3 cm above the upper margin of the symphysis pubis ( fig . \n we investigated whether the age , gender , height , history of radical pelvic surgery , or the distance between the upper margin of the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus influenced the possibility of bowel interposition between the bladder and the skin at the suprapubic puncture site . \n statistical analyses were performed by applying the chi - square test and multiple logistic regression using commercially available software spss ver . \n 14.0 ( spss inc . , chicago , il , usa ) . a p - value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant . \n the patients ' mean age was 63 years ( range , 26 - 84 years ) . among the 226 patients , 22 ( 9.7% ) had undergone radical pelvic surgery previously . \n the mean distance between the upper margin of the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus was 14.4 cm ( range , 7.2 - 21.0 cm ) ( table 1 ) . \n the univariate analysis showed that sex ( female , p=0.028 ) , obesity ( body mass index [ bmi]25 kg / m , p=0.006 ) , a positive history of radical pelvic surgery ( p<0.001 ) , and a short distance ( 11 cm , p=0.016 ) between the upper margin of the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus were significantly correlated with bowel interposition at the routine suprapubic puncture site ( table 2 ) . among the 22 patients who had a radical pelvic operation , 20 had lower anterior resection , and the other 2 had segmental resection of the rectum due to rectal or colon cancer . in the multivariate analysis , \n obesity ( p=0.019 ) , a positive history of pelvic surgery ( p=0.001 ) , and a short distance ( p=0.016 ) between the upper margin of the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus were independent predictors for the bowel passing through the percutaneous tract ( table 3 ) . \n in our multivariate analysis , obesity , a history of pelvic surgery , and a short distance between the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus were independent predictors of bowel interposition through the percutaneous suprapubic cystostomy tract . \n prior pelvic surgery is a well known risk factor for bowel injury after percutaneous cystostomy . after a pelvic operation , \n the bowel can move downward through the opened space of retzius , and associated postoperative adhesions may develop between the anterior abdominal wall and peritoneum , both of which may increase the probability of bowel injury during a suprapubic cystostomy procedure . in our study , 9 of the 22 patients ( 40.9% ) who had radical pelvic surgery had an interposed bowel at the routine suprapubic cystostomy tract , whereas 17 of the 204 ( 8.3% ) without a history of pelvic surgery had bowel interposition . \n all of the prior pelvic surgeries were opened lower anterior resections because of rectal or colon cancer . \n obesity has also been considered as a risk factor for bowel injury when performing a suprapubic cystostomy because it is difficult to localize the bladder in such patients . \n our study presented the novel hypothesis that obesity itself is an independent predictor for bowel interposition through the cystostomy tract . \n we do not know the exact reason for the above finding , but assumed that because obese patients have relatively larger bowel contents as well as omental fat , the bowel tended to move downward in the limited intra - abdominal space . \n similarly , the correlation of bowel interposition with a short distance between the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus can be understood in the same manner . as we mentioned above , 8.3% of the patients without a history of pelvic surgery had interposition of the bowel through the routine cystostomy tract . \n this was much higher than the general consensus , because the placement of a suprapubic tube for urinary diversion is generally an uneventful procedure . \n for the safe placement of a suprapubic catheter , the most important point is the full distension of the urinary bladder before the procedure . in this study , we considered bladder distension more than 6 cm above the upper margin of the symphysis pubis as a cutoff point on the basis of data from voiding cystourethrograms performed in 20 adult patients with neuropathic bladder . in their films , \n the average distance between the symphysis pubis and the upper margin of the cystogram at full bladder distension was 6.2 cm . \n we therefore defined 6 cm as the assumptive point of full bladder distension . because a fully distended bladder in a normal patient without neuropathic bladder can rise more than 6 cm above the symphysis pubis \n , it seemed likely that our results overdetected the bowel interposition through the cystostomy tract . \n however , we should take into consideration that , clinically , the complications of suprapubic cystostomy are commonly seen in small capacity bladder with neuropathic deficits . in the practical \n setting , although a small capacity bladder itself would be the major risk factor for complications in performing suprapubic cystostomy , the retrospective nature of our study could not reveal that relationship . \n the high exclusion rate ( 71.6% ) was another major pitfall of this study , because patients who underwent abdominopelvic ct scan were not instructed to endure the urge to urinate . \n to our knowledge , this is the first study that attempted to reveal the risk factors of possible bowel injury related to suprapubic cystostomy , even though the study was performed by an indirect approach . \n this study demonstrated the risk factors for the bowel being interposed at the routine suprapubic puncture site as detected by ct scan . \n when performing a suprapubic cystostomy , extreme caution is needed to avoid possible bowel injury in patients who are obese , who have had previous radical pelvic operations , and who have a short distance ( 11 cm ) between the upper margin of the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus .",

      "document": "By late February and early March 2020, the global outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, had entered a new phase, with community spread occurring in many countries and several U.S. states. Concerns grew over the potential for the disease to spread widely, leading to increased hospitalizations and deaths. On March 6, 2020, Congress and the President enacted the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 ( P.L. 116-123 ), to provide emergency supplemental appropriations to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus outbreak. This report provides an overview of appropriations in Division A and relevant policies and requirements pursuant to the supplemental. Funding in Division A is designated as being provided as an emergency requirement. For the purposes of the supplemental, the term \"coronavirus\" refers to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-2019, or another coronavirus with pandemic potential. For an overview of congressional reporting requirements in the act, see CRS Insight IN11236, Oversight Provisions in H.R. 6074, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act , by Ben Wilhelm. Prior to the enactment of P.L. 116-123 , domestic health coronavirus preparedness and response activities were primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) using certain existing funding streams and transfer authorities. For instance, on January 25, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that COVID-19 response activities would be supported by an allotment of $105 million from existing balances in the Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund (IDRRRF; see the \" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \" section of this report). In addition, on February 2, 2020, HHS reportedly notified Congress of its intention to transfer up to $136 million to COVID-19 response efforts from other existing HHS accounts. On February 24, 2020, the Administration asked Congress for emergency supplemental appropriations of $1.25 billion for the HHS Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) to support COVID-19 response efforts. The Administration's request included a number of other proposals, mostly related to repurposing existing funds from across the government, including HHS funds for current Ebola response activities. All told, the Administration estimated needing to allocate about $2.5 billion toward COVID-19 repose efforts. The supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 6074 , was introduced and passed in the House on March 4, 2020; passed in the Senate on March 5, 2020; and signed into law ( P.L. 116-123 ) by the President on March 6, 2020. Division A of P.L. 116-123 provides a total of $7.767 billion in supplemental appropriations to aid in the U.S. and global coronavirus preparedness and response. This total includes $6.497 billion for the HHS (including contingent amounts), $20 million for the Small Business Administration, and $1.250 billion for foreign operations activities provided across several agencies and funding mechanisms. The funding is largely intended to aid in the domestic public health response to the outbreak, with limited amounts available for global health, diplomatic programs, and domestic and international economic assistance activities. Division B, which addresses telehealth services, is covered in CRS Report R46239, Telehealth and Telemedicine: Frequently Asked Questions . Table 1 displays funds appropriated in Division A. The table is organized by each federal department or agency, with funds further broken down by account, program, or activity. The text below the table is organized in the same order and includes more detailed information on the purposes and specified uses of these funds. Titles I and III of P.L. 116-123 provide a total of about $6.5 billion in appropriations to the Department of Health Human Services (HHS) for health emergency response activities related to COVID-19. The funds in these titles are provided to \"prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally.\" Funds largely support domestic activities, but certain accounts have available funding for HHS global health activities. (For information on additional international funding, see the \" Foreign Operations \" section of this report.) Title I provides $61 million to FDA for domestic and international efforts \"to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus\" to be used for activities such as development of medical countermeasures (e.g., therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics), advanced manufacturing for medical products, monitoring of medical product supply chains, and related administrative activities. Title III makes $2.2 billion available to CDC for domestic and international preparedness and response activities, including the following: Not less than $950 million is for grants or cooperative agreements to \"States, localities, territories, tribes, tribal organizations, urban Indian health organizations, or health service providers.\" (The bill calls for HHS to allocate at least half of these funds within 30 days of enactment.) The funds are for core public health functions, including surveillance, laboratory capacity, infection control, and other activities. Per the bill, each grantee that received a Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) grant for FY2019 shall receive 90% of that amount (totaling $561 million). In addition, not less than $40 million shall be allocated to tribes and tribal organizations. The bill requires certain grantees receiving these funds to submit a spend plan to the CDC not later than 45 days after the date of enactment. Several days after enactment, on March 11, 2020, CDC announced almost $600 million in awards to state and local PHEP grantees, additional funding to the cities of Houston and Philadelphia, and $750,000 to the Cherokee Nation, for a total of $605 million. On March 20, HHS announced that the CDC was preparing to provide an additional $80 million in funding to tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations for response activities. In total, the $81 million to tribes and tribal organizations exceeds the required allocation in the supplemental. Based on these initial reports, CRS estimates that, as of the date of this report, about $265 million remains to be used at the CDC Director's discretion to target funds for certain jurisdictions or organizations, research, public health activities, and administrative functions. Not less than $300 million is for global disease detection and emergency response. $300 million shall be transferred to the CDC Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund (IDRRRF). Amounts in the IDRRRF may be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to an infectious disease emergency, as authorized by several titles of the Public Health Service Act, and may be transferred by the CDC Director between CDC, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) accounts. Funds may be used for domestic and global activities. In addition to the activities detailed above, the supplemental specifies that the funds appropriated to the CDC may be used for grants for the construction, alteration, or renovation of nonfederally owned facilities to improve preparedness and response capability at the state and local level. Title III makes $836 million available to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at NIH. These funds are for preparedness and response to COVID-19. NIAID supports scientific research on COVID-19 and other coronaviruses, as well as product development for medical countermeasures (e.g., vaccines) that could be used to curb the spread of the virus and/or to lessen its health impact. The bill specifies that of the total provided to NIAID, not less than $10 million is to be transferred to National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) for worker-based training to prevent and reduce exposure of hospital employees, emergency first responders, and other workers who are at risk of exposure to coronavirus through their work duties. NIEHS is the primary NIH institute for environmental health research. The Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund is an account used in appropriations acts to provide the HHS Secretary with one-time or emergency funding, as well as annual funding for the office of the HHS Assistance Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). Title III of P.L. 116-123 makes $3.1 billion available to the PHSSEF for domestic and international coronavirus preparedness and response. PHSSEF funds may support a variety of activities, including product development and manufacturing for medical countermeasures (vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics) prioritizing platform-based technologies with U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities; the development of manufacturing platforms for such products; the purchase of medical countermeasures and medical supplies; the expansion of medical surge capacity; grants to improve nonfederally owned facilities to improve preparedness and response capabilities at the state and local level; and grants to improve nonfederally owned facilities for the production of medical countermeasures. Title III also states that the HHS Secretary may take actions authorized under current law to ensure that products developed with provided funding will be affordable in the commercial market; however, the Secretary cannot take actions that delay the development of such products. The bill specifies that, out of the $3.1 billion: $100 million is to be transferred to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Bureau of Primary Health Care for grants under the Health Centers Program. Up to $2 million is to be transferred to, and merged with, funding for the HHS Office of Inspector General for the oversight of the activities supported with funds appropriated to HHS in titles I and III. An unspecified amount may be transferred to, and merged with, the Covered Countermeasure Process Fund. This fund may compensate eligible individuals who suffer injuries as a result of a medical countermeasure administered or used under a declaration of the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act). In addition to the $3.1 billion appropriation to the PHSSEF, the supplemental provides another $300 million in PHSSEF appropriations that are contingent upon future actions by HHS. The contingent funds may be used to purchase medical products (e.g., vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics). However, in order for the additional $300 million to become available, HHS must certify to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees that (1) funds from the initial $3.1 billion that had been allotted for purchase of such products will be obligated imminently and (2) the additional funds are necessary to purchase vaccines, therapeutics, or diagnostics in quantities that will adequately address the public health need. Title III contains a number of general and other provisions that provide further guidance or additional requirements associated with the supplemental funds. For example, these provisions give HHS certain hiring and contract flexibilities. In addition, they authorize HHS to use funds to restore certain prior obligations, and they establish certain expectations with respect to spend plans, transfers, and reporting and notifications to Congress. Title III includes general provisions authorizing HHS to use amounts appropriated in this title to restore certain obligations incurred by HHS prior to the date of enactment for activities related to coronavirus preparedness and response. In some cases, HHS is required to reverse these actions. Specifically, HHS is directed to restore any amounts that had been transferred or reprogrammed for these purposes pursuant to a notice to appropriations committees on February 2, 2020. Title III general provisions also specify that funds for certain grant awards or cooperative agreements to states, localities, and other entities are to include amounts to reimburse those entities for costs incurred for relevant public health and other preparedness and response activities between January 20, 2020, and the date of enactment. Titles III includes the following reporting and notification requirements for HHS, generally, and for specific HHS agencies: Spend Plan: HHS must provide a spend plan to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not later than 30 days after the date of enactment. The spend plan must address anticipated uses of all funds made available to HHS in the supplemental. The spend plan must be updated and submitted to these committees every 60 days until September 30, 2024, and must include a list of each contract obligation in excess of $5 million that has not previously been reported. Transfer Authority: HHS must notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees 10 days in advance of a transfer made between CDC, NIH, and PHSSEF accounts. HHS may transfer nearly all amounts appropriated in Title III to these specified agencies and accounts, provided the transfers are made to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally. Contracting: HHS must notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees prior to using funding provided under Title III to enter into contracts with individuals for the provision of personal services to support coronavirus preparedness and response. Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund (IDRRRF): The HHS Secretary, in consultation with the CDC Director, shall provide a report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees every 14 days for a full year after the Secretary has made certain determinations with respect to the IDRRRF. Specifically, these reports must be made if the Secretary, pursuant to Section 231 of P.L. 115-245 , has made IDRRRF funds available (1) after declaring a Public Health Emergency or (2) determining that an infectious disease emergency has significant potential to imminently occur and to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens. In the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, the HHS Secretary issued a determination allowing for the allotment of funds from the IDRRRF on January 25, 2020. The Secretary subsequently declared COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency Public Emergency effective January 27, 2020. The report to the appropriations committees must detail IDRRRF commitment and obligation information in excess of $5 million and upon request of the committees. Title II of P.L. 116-123 provides the Small Business Administration (SBA) with $20 million until expended for administrative expenses to carry out the SBA Disaster Loan Program. Title II also deems the coronavirus outbreak a disaster under Section 7(b)(2)(D) of the Small Business Act. Prior to the amendment, some questioned whether the coronavirus outbreak would meet the Small Business Act's legal definition of a disaster. The amendment addresses this question and clarifies that SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) can be made available. Title II does not provide additional funding to the SBA for disaster loans, including SBA EIDL. Instead, SBA EIDL loan funding in response to the coronavirus outbreak (as well as SBA disaster loan funding for other incidents) is to be funded by roughly $1.2 billion in disaster loan credit subsidy, which includes just over $1.1 billion in disaster loan credit subsidy carried over from previous years. This is possible because the Disaster Loan Account is a \"no-year\" account. No-year funding does not lapse at the end of the fiscal year. Rather, it is carried over to the next fiscal year. A summary of the supplemental released by the House Appropriations Committee noted that the SBA is expected to make $1 billion in credit subsidy available to support the cost of anticipated defaults and related expenses of about $7 billion in EIDL loans. Still, the $1.2 billion in loan subsidy may be of concern to some if EIDL assistance in response to the outbreak becomes significant, if there is an uptick in 2020 disasters, or both. Consequently, Congress could consider providing additional supplemental funding through another appropriations package. In addition, though the coronavirus outbreak is now considered by the SBA to be a disaster, SBA EIDL is not being made automatically available to businesses. Instead, EIDL must be requested by the state or territory governor by requesting one of the following types of declarations: (1) a major disaster declaration under the under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-288 , as amended); (2) an SBA EIDL declaration under the Small Business Act (P.L. 83-163); (3) an SBA EIDL declaration under the Small Business Act based on the determination of a natural disaster by the Secretary of Agriculture; or (4) an SBA EIDL declaration based on the determination of the Secretary of Commerce that a fishery resource disaster has occurred. Title IV of P.L. 116-123 provides a total of $1.25 billion for Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations accounts, $264 million of which is to be managed by the Department of State and $971 million of which is to be managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Title IV designates $264 million for the Department of State's Diplomatic Programs account, which is the department's principal operating account. Generally, the account provides for human resources functions, overseas programs, security programs, and diplomatic policy and support. P.L. 116-123 indicates that the emergency funds for Diplomatic Programs are meant to support consular operations, reimburse evacuation expenses, and bolster emergency preparedness measures. The act specified the provision of $971 million across a number of bilateral assistance appropriations accounts. These include the following: Office of Inspector General. $1 million to USAID's Office of Inspector General to support oversight of COVID-19-related programming. Global Health Programs. $435 million to the Global Health Programs (GHP) account, with which USAID intends to prioritize the following interventions in developing countries affected by and at-risk of COVID-19: screening at points of entry and exit; the purchase of key health commodities (e.g., diagnostics, personal protective equipment, and disinfectants); the prevention and control of infections in critical health facilities; readiness to identify, diagnose, manage, and treat cases rapidly; the identification and follow-up of contacts; awareness-raising in populations through risk-communication and community-engagement; the implementation of health measures for travelers; logistics and supply-chain management; global and regional coordination; and country-level readiness and response. According to USAID, the \"funding will help address the threat of COVID-19 in the following high-priority countries:\u00c2\u00a0The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan; the Republics of Angola, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kenya, South Africa, Tajikistan, The Philippines, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Zambia, and Zimbabwe; the People's Republic of Bangladesh; Burma; the Kingdom of Cambodia; the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; the Kyrgyz Republic; the Lao People's Democratic Republic; Mongolia; the Federal Republic of Nepal; the Federal Republic of Nigeria; the Islamic Republic of Pakistan; the Kingdom of Thailand; and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\" The supplemental specifies that, out of the total appropriated to the GHP account, $200 million is to be transferred into USAID's Emergency Reserve Fund (ERF) to support coronavirus-related programs, including pandemic prevention, preparedness, and control. The ERF was established under the GHP account within final FY2017 appropriations ( P.L. 115-31 ) \"to enable the United States and the international public health community to respond rapidly to emerging health threats.\" International Disaster Assistance. $300 million for coronavirus response efforts through the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account. Broadly, the account is used for relief and recovery efforts in the wake of disasters\u00e2\u0080\u0094both natural and human-induced. Economic Support Fund. $250 million in emergency funds for addressing coronavirus-related \"economic, security, and stabilization requirements\" through the Economic Support Fund (ESF). The ESF account supports myriad objectives, ranging from more traditional development activities to those that advance U.S. political and strategic goals. In the general provisions of Title IV of P.L. 116-123 , Congress primarily offers guidance and requirements on transfer authorities, the Administration's strategy for fighting COVID-19 on an international scale, and the intervals in which Congress requires reporting. Transfer Authorities. The act provides broad transfer authorities across GHP, IDA, and ESF, in an effort to grant flexibility to USAID in its COVID-19 response. However, five days prior to transferring funds, the Secretary of State or USAID Administrator must notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees of the transfer's details. Strategy. The act requires the Secretary of State and USAID Administrator to issue a joint strategy to \"prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus abroad\" within 15 days of the supplemental's enactment. Reporting. In addition to regular reporting requirements for each appropriations account, the act includes a provision that requires additional reporting for the supplemental funds. The act requires the Secretary of State and USAID Administrator to jointly submit to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees a report detailing the use of the supplemental funds within 30 days of enactment. Following submission of the report, it is required to be updated every 60 days until September 30, 2022, and then every 180 days after that until all funds have been expended. This reporting structure is relatively consistent with other SFOPS supplemental appropriations measures that have been enacted in the past decade. Use of Funds to Restore Prior Obligations. The act specifies that supplemental funds appropriated to certain accounts (Diplomatic Programs, GHP, IDA, and ESF) may be used to reimburse accounts administered by the Department of State and the USAID for obligations incurred prior to enactment for activities to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus. (Certain limitations are placed on use of these funds for certain obligations previously incurred by ESF.) ",
      "summary": "In the early months of 2020, the federal government began to express concern over the global outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus. By late January, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had invoked certain authorities to direct existing funds to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. The HHS Secretary declared COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency, effective January 27, 2020. On February 24, 2020, the Trump Administration submitted an initial emergency supplemental appropriations request to Congress. The Administration requested $1.25 billion in new funds for the HHS Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) to support COVID-19 response efforts. The request included a number of other proposals, mostly related to repurposing existing funds from across the government toward response activities. All told, the Administration estimated needing to allocate about $2.5 billion toward COVID-19 response efforts. On March 4, 2020, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 ( H.R. 6074 ), was introduced in the House. The bill was passed by the House (415-2) on March 4 and by the Senate (96-1) on March 5. The bill was signed into law ( P.L. 116-123 ) on March 6. This supplemental appropriations act is the first such act to be enacted in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak. Any subsequent such actions are beyond the scope of the report. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Division A of P.L. 116-123 provides roughly $7.8 billion in discretionary supplemental appropriations. (CBO estimates that provisions in Division B will cost roughly $490 million, but those provisions are not the focus of this report.) The funds in Division A of P.L. 116-123 are primarily intended to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus. (For purposes of the bill, the term coronavirus refers to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-2019, or another coronavirus with pandemic potential.) The majority of the funds in Division A are appropriated to HHS agencies and accounts. In total, the bill appropriates $6.5 billion to HHS, representing 84% of all funds in the bill. In general, these funds are for health emergency prevention, preparedness, and response activities related to COVID-19. Funds largely support domestic activities, but certain accounts include funds that may be allocated for global health activities. The HHS funds are distributed as follows: The PHSSEF receives almost half of all funds in Division A, with appropriations totaling $3.4 billion when including $300 million in appropriations that are contingent upon future actions by HHS. PHSSEF funds are provided for the development of countermeasures and vaccines, as well as for the purchase of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, necessary medical supplies, medical surge capacity, and administrative activities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) receives the next-largest share of all funds in the supplemental: $2.8 billion, accounting for more than a quarter of all funds in Division A. In general, these funds are intended to support core public health functions, including surveillance, laboratory capacity, infection control, and other activities. The funds are also for global disease detection and emergency response, as well as for activities carried out using the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund (IDRRRF). Remaining HHS funds are appropriated to the Food and Drug Administration ($61 million) and the National Institutes of Health ($836 million). In addition to amounts appropriated to HHS, the supplemental provides $20 million in administrative funds for the Disaster Loans Program Account within the Small Business Administration (SBA). The supplemental also includes provisions clarifying that SBA disaster loans and economic injury disaster loans may be made in response to COVID-19. Finally, the supplemental provides nearly $1.3 billion (about 16% of all funds in Division A) to support foreign operations activities across several agencies and funding mechanisms. This includes funding to help the Department of State maintain consular operations, reimburse for evacuation expenses, and support emergency preparedness. Additional funds are provided for global health, international disaster assistance, economic support, and certain oversight activities.",

its highest incidence rate is around the age of 60 - 80   .however , according to a report by yavari and et al . \n iran s highest incidence was between the age of 50 and 70 based on their studied population . \n its prognosis is usually undesirable and median survival after esophagectomy for patients with localized tumor is 15 - 18 months , and 5-year survival rate is 20 - 25% . \n the risk of esophageal cancer increases with constant exposure to stimulants , hot beverages , alcohol and smoking . \n it has a higher incidence rate in society with a low economical state , severe malnutrition , low vitamin , fruit and vegetable intake and also high consumption of alcohol and cigarettes \n in various studies conducted in china , relative risk of patients with a family history of esophageal cancer was around 2.9% of cases . \n its prevention is based on early diagnosis , special attention to modifiable risk factors , particularly tobacco , alcohol and fast food consumption . \n the symptoms of esophageal cancer usually appear 3 to 4 months prior to diagnosis and such symptoms vary depending on initial involved segment of esophagus . \n dysphagia is seen in more than 90% of cases while a weight loss over 5% of body weight occurs in 5% and its presence is associated with a worse prognosis . \n less common symptoms such as hoarseness , cough and progressive lesions with invasion to other organs result in symptoms such as hematemesis , hemoptysis , dyspnea and cough secondary to bronchoesophageal and tracheoesophageal fistula . \n considering most studies on statistic for epidemiologic indexes in esophageal cancer are implemented in other parts of the world , we aim this study which is to determine epidemiologic index of esophageal cancer patients provides better information on epidemiological characteristic of such cases and also a reliable base for future complementary studies . \n this is a cross - sectional prospective study based on medical history and other collected data from 238 esophageal cancer patients referred to omid hospital between 2001 and 2010 . \n no distant metastases , 2 . a karnofski score of 70 and over for the performance status . \n at the beginning of study , informed consent was obtained from patients for neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment . \n the collected data included age , sex , race , occupation , residential location , addiction history , alcohol and smoking habits , dysphagia grading ( i , ii , iii , iv , v ) , weight loss , nausea and vomiting , lack of appetite and paraclinic tests : cbc , liver function tests , sonography or ct scan of abdomen , barium swallow and also anatomic location of tumor , lesion type in endoscopy , lesion length and also type and grade of tumor pathology . \n twenty two point three percent of patients were younger than 50 years and 77.7% were older . \n 63% were fars , 13% were turkmen and 24% were from other ethnic groups . regarding the occupation , 30% were farmers , 45% were housewives and 25% had other jobs ; they came mostly ( 72.3% ) from the rural areas . \n twenty percent ( 33.3% of males and 8.5% of females ) had a history of smoking , 22.3% ( 31.5 of males and 14.6% of females ) were addicted and 1.3% of patients had alcohol consumption ( table 1 ) . \n the most common anatomical site was the middle ( 53.4% ) , lower ( 44.5% ) and upper ( 2.1% ) segment of esophagus ( table 2 ) . \n considering clinical signs and symptoms , most patients ( 93.7% ) complained about dysphagia over an average duration of 3.4 months . also 24% , 53% and 23% of patients had grade i and ii , iii , iv and v dysphagia , respectively ( table 3 ) . amongst patients whom their clinical symptoms were registered completely , 84% had weight loss i.e. 21% ( 1 - 5 kg ) , 17% ( 5 - 10 kg ) and 16% more than 10 kg . \n nausea was recorded in 39% and vomiting in 27.7% . before treatment , anemia , leukopenia and thrombocytopenia \n were detected in 39% , 2.1% and 0.6% of cases , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n barium swallow results were abnormal in 65.5% and normal in 6.4% ; it was not performed in 28.1% of cases . at the beginning of the study , all patients had an abdominal sonography with no metastases . \n on endoscopy , 51.3% of lesions were polypoid , vegetative and fungoid while in 48.7% were ulcerative , ulcerovegetative and infiltrative . \n the mean lesion length according to endoscopy and barium swallow was 5.7 cm ; the tumor length was less than 5 cm in 52.5% and more in 47.5% ( table 2 ) . \n the most common pathology was squamous cell carcinoma with 99.1% prevalence . according to tumor grading , 34.2% \n were well differentiated , 51.3% were moderately differentiated and 14.5% were poorly differentiated ( table 3 ) . \n in this prospective cross sectional study , epidemiologic status of esophageal cancer was evaluated in a specific area i.e. the northeast of iran and cases were selected from patients who were referred to omid hospital for undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment . \n the goal and reason for selecting this study group was to ensure that their data are usually precisely registered in the form of a protocol . \n the reported data in this study included : age , sex , race , location , smoking and addiction history . \n prevalent clinical symptoms including dysphagia ( and its grade ) , weight loss , anemia , nausea and vomiting . \n many esophageal cancer reports belong to regions of the world where this type of cancer is considered prevalent . \n the incidence rate in the northern china , iran , and russia and around the caspian sea is 100 per 100,000 populations . \n the mean age of the patients was 59 years in our study . in recent report from cdc in iran \n the mean age at the time of diagnosis in u.s . is 69 years , whereas in our study the mean age was 10 years lower . \n considering that these patients were candidates for preoperative chemoradiation protocol ; this difference is partially related to bias in patient selection . in another study \n the mean age of 190 esophageal cancer patients chosen for chemoradiation protocol , was 65 years . \n the effect of race on the incidence rate has been investigated in several studies . in cumings \n study which was performed on 1801 esophageal cancer ( scc ) patients in u.s , the incidence rate was 5 and 1.3 in 100,000 in both white and black population respectively . however , adenocarcinoma had a higher incidence rate amongst the whites ( 8 vs. 3.3 in 100,000 ) . despite considerable distance between our center and golestan province , \n various studies have revealed that residents who are living around the caspian sea are at a greater risk for developing this type of cancer . \n possible reasons include a diet deficient in fruits , vegetables and animal proteins as well as dry and thick bread which consists of silica fibers ; hot tea , smoking , drugs and burnt opium . \n smoking , drug and alcohol consumption are the main factors causing this type of cancer in western countries . \n however , few studies have shown no significant correlation between such factors and esophageal cancer . in the current study 19.7% of affected cases were smokers and 22.3% were drug abuser . \n study in babolsar , a northern city of iran , 19.3% had a positive smoking history but only 7.9% were addicts . smoking tobacco and drinking of alcohol \n fortunately in iran due to religious beliefs alcohol consumption is not popular , but smoking and drug abuse are most probably important factors . as reported by heeying kimm and et al . in korean men , alcohol and smoking are indecency associated with increased risk of esophageal cancer but they do not interact synergistically . considering the characteristics of developed tumors \n , it should be noted that adenocarcinoma has a very small portion in comparison to scc in esophageal tumors in our country . \n the incidence rate of adenocarcinoma has increased over the past two decades in western countries and at the moment it is more common than scc , for example only 40% of esophageal cancers in u.s . \n are scc . however in some regions of the world with a high incidence rate for this type of cancer , scc is more prevalent than adenocarcinoma . in developed countries where adenocarcinoma has drastically increased , \n this cancer is associated with reflux and obesity [ 13 , 14 ] . amongst our 238 cases , \n other studies in iran have also confirmed the predominance of scc over adenocarcinoma . according to a study reported by farhoudi et al . \n 86.3 % and 7.3% of cases showed scc and adenocarcinoma respectively . also considering that the current study was performed on patients who had undergone surgery after chemoradiotherapy , only cases with mediastinal esophagus involvement were investigated . in 53.4% of patients \n , tumors were localized in the middle third of esophagus and 43.3% in the lower third as described by hajian studies . in farhoudi study in mashhad \n the lower third was also considered as the most common site . in the current study , the lesion types considered as effective factors of prognosis and they were polipoid , vegetative and fungoid in 51.3% as well as ulcerative , ulcerovegetative and infiltrative in 48.7% of cases . \n in summary , scc comprised more than 99% of all esophageal cancers in our patients and this was also the prominent type in northeast of iran . in our patients ,",

      "document": "esophageal cancer is a devastating disease with rapidly increasing incidence in western . despite important advances in therapy , \n > 50% of patients have incurable disease at diagnosis and only 510% of these patients have life expectancy > 5 years . \n dysphagia is the most common symptom that afflicts these patients , causing 70% of complaints , and leading to severe malnutrition and reduced quality of life [ 1 , 2 ] . \n this factor prevents curative treatment in the majority of them , thus making palliative care a more realistic option [ 1 , 3 ] . \n although surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for early cancers , palliative esophagectomy is not recommended due to high mortality rates . \n however , surgical procedures in order to bypass the dietary route with relief of dysphagia have been reported in the literature but have fallen into disuse because of the morbidity and mortality of the procedure itself and advances in endoscopic treatment . \n this paper demonstrates the use of surgical treatment using the laparoscopic approach in the palliative care of a patient with advanced esophageal cancer . \n a 69-year - old male presented with progressive dysphagia , retrosternal pain and weight loss of 10 kg in 2 months . \n the finding was a circumferential lesion from 19 to 25 cm of the incisors , with biopsy diagnosing squamous cell carcinoma . \n radiological examinations showed lymphadenopathy in the celiac trunk and in the mediastinal area . a bronchoscopy diagnosed tracheal infiltration by neoplasia . \n the patient was treated with external radiotherapy ( 13  250 cgy ) with symptom relief and regained performance status ( from 3 to 1 ) . however , after re - staging exams , the persistence of the disease was diagnosed , with dysphagia worsening . \n the technique , as described by lacerda et al . in a previous report , involves the creation of a gastric tube close to 3 cm in width and with an average length of 30 cm ( fig . \n 1 ) and preservation of the right gastroepiploic vessels by laparoscopy . \n figure  1:gastric tube . \n the tube is then passed along a retrosternal path and end - to - side anastomosis using a circular stapler is performed with the cervical esophagus prepared earlier by left cervicotomy . \n a laminar drain is applied in the cervical incision ( fig .  2 ) . \n the patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth post - operative day with oral intake . no leakage or other complication \n the patient survived for 4 months , gained 10 kg in this period and did not refer any dysphagia after the procedure . \n currently , there are several methods for this purpose , including the esophageal stent , endoscopic dilation , radiotherapy ( both external and endoluminal  brachytherapy ) , chemotherapy and laser recanalization ( yag ) . \n the choice of procedure and the response to treatment should be properly related to life expectancy , which has also been related to performance status , weight loss , tumor extension , clinical stage , sex and age . \n dysphagia from inoperable esophageal cancer is a common and complex management problem , and there is no consensus on the ideal treatment approach . \n all methods have their own advantages and disadvantages in rapid or late onset effect in symptom relief as in recurrence . \n no single intervention palliates dysphagia at all time for every patient ; therefore , healthcare providers must assess the risks and benefits of each palliative intervention for individual patients . \n surgical resection is still cited in the literature as a way to palliate esophageal cancer but is restricted to patients with severe risk of complications ( e.g. perforation or incontrollable tumor bleeding ) due to high morbidity and mortality in relation to non - surgical palliative options . \n that there are no randomized controlled studies to compare the addition of surgery to palliative chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone . \n they also state that such studies may become possible and worthwhile if minimal access surgery can be achieved that has reduced complications and better recovery of health - related quality of life than standard open surgery . in 1979 , postlethwait   proposed a technique for esophageal bypass surgery with an isoperistaltic gastric tube , and this method is still used despite its morbidity . \n this report demonstrates that an update in the technique proposed by postlethwait for palliation of esophageal cancer with the use of minimal access surgery is feasible . \n according to the current literature , the bypass procedure in order to palliate dysphagia could be reserved for patients in which the stent has failed or contraindicated . \n high costs can sometimes make the lesser invasive procedure more prohibitive to the patient than surgery itself .",
      "summary": "esophageal cancer is a devastating disease with rapidly increasing incidence in western countries . \n dysphagia is the most common complication , causing severe malnutrition and reduced quality of life . \n a 69-year - old male with persistent esophageal cancer after radiation therapy was subjected to palliative by - pass surgery using a laparoscopic approach . \n due to the advanced stage at diagnosis , palliative treatment was a more realistic option . \n dysphagia is a most distressing symptom of this disease , causing malnutrition and reducing quality of life . \n the goal of palliation is to improve swallowing . \n the most common methods applied are endoscopic stenting , radiation therapy ( external or brachytherapy ) , chemotherapy , yttrium - aluminum - garnet laser rechanneling or endoscopic dilatation . \n palliative surgery is rarely proposed due to morbidity and complications . \n this paper demonstrates an update in the technique proposed by postlethwait in 1979 for palliation of esophageal cancer .",

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The viability of the domestic steel industry is crucial \n        to the United States economy and national security.\n            (2) The steel and taconite iron mining industries have been \n        severely impacted by the foreign dumping and overproduction of \n        steel and are continually faced with unfair trade practices.\n            (3) In 2014, United States imports of steel and steel \n        products increased by 36 percent and captured 28 percent of the \n        total United States steel market. In 2015, United States \n        imports of steel and steel products continued to increase, and \n        captured 29 percent of the total United States steel market.\n            (4) In 1974, Congress enacted the Trade Act of 1974 (19 \n        U.S.C. 2101 et seq.), which established the trade adjustment \n        assistance program under chapter 2 of title II of that Act (19 \n        U.S.C. 2271 et seq.) to assist workers who have been adversely \n        affected by trade.\n            (5) The trade adjustment assistance program provides vital \n        benefits and services to workers whose employment has been \n        adversely affected by foreign trade. Those benefits and \n        services include education and training, income support, \n        relocation assistance, job search assistance, and the health \n        coverage tax credit.\n            (6) Since the inception of the trade adjustment assistance \n        program, more than 5,000,000 United States workers have been \n        certified as eligible for benefits and services under the \n        program.\n            (7) As of September 30, 2015, the trade adjustment \n        assistance program had served more than 2,200,000 workers.\n            (8) In fiscal year 2015, the Department of Labor certified \n        413 petitions for eligibility for the trade adjustment \n        assistance program, which provided access to trade adjustment \n        assistance benefits for 57,631 workers.\n            (9) In 2015, more than 13,000 new participants were \n        enrolled in the trade adjustment assistance for workers program \n        and the program provided services and benefits to more than \n        47,000 workers.\n            (10) From fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2015, the \n        average processing time for a petition under the trade \n        adjustment assistance for workers program was 49.1 days and the \n        average processing time for fiscal year 2015 was 47.2 days.\n            (11) The trade adjustment assistance program provides vital \n        education and training services to assist trade-affected \n        workers to acquire new skills and prepare for new employment.\n            (12) From 2012 through 2015, more than 9,800 steelworkers \n        and iron ore miners in 17 States lost their jobs as a result of \n        increases in imports of steel and steel products and were \n        certified as eligible to apply for the trade adjustment \n        assistance program.\n            (13) In fiscal year 2015, more than 6,500 steelworkers were \n        certified as eligible for trade adjustment assistance, \n        including workers who were laid off or furloughed in 2014.\n            (14) In order to empower workers who have been adversely \n        affected by foreign trade, States should have the option of \n        providing the funding for vital educational and training \n        programs for workers while their petitions for certification of \n        eligibility for trade adjustment assistance is pending.\n\nSEC. 3.

      "document": "peripheral vascular disease of upper extremity seldom leads to tissue loss because of the relatively low metabolic demand and extensive collaterals of upper limb . \n patients with end - stage renal failure ( esrf ) are more prone to finger gangrene , especially those with multilevel stenosis or calcification involving the forearm vessels , as shown in clinical and autopsy studies.1 this is also particularly important in patients with elbow - based arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis , as there is a danger of arterial steal . \n other differential diagnoses included rheumatological diseases , raynaud s disease , frostbites , or distal emboli . \n many patients with finger gangrene presented to orthopedic surgeons for primary amputation , but there are more reports29 now of revascularization of forearm arteries to be a useful adjunct for finger salvage . \n we report a case of successful angioplasty of forearm arteries in a patient with esrf , and thereby saving her finger , with good clinical and functional outcome . \n a 51-year - old right - handed lady with esrf presented with a 2 months history of progressively worsening infected gangrene involving her right ring finger which developed after a nail clipping injury . \n past medical history was significant for 20 years of esrf due to unknown etiology , currently on hemodialysis via a right neck permcath catheter , hypertension , and percutaneous coronary angioplasty via a right femoral access . on presentation , her right hand was pale and there was infected gangrene of her right ring finger , which was edematous and inflammed and spreading to the proximal pharynx . \n her right radial and ulnar pulses were absent at the wrist , but her brachial pulse was palpable . \n duplex ultrasound ( philips iu22 ; philips healthcare solutions , bothell , wa , usa ) showed severe multilevel stenosis of the forearm radial artery and occlusion of the forearm ulnar artery . \n the ultrasound criteria of moderate stenosis ( 50% ) was at - stenosis and pre - stenosis velocity ratio of more than or equal to 2.0 , or a peak systolic velocity of more than or equal to 200 cm / s . \n criteria of severe stenosis ( 75% ) was velocity ratio of more than or equal to 4.0 , or peak systolic velocity of more than or equal to 400 cm / s . in view of the duplex findings , urgent revascularization of forearm arteries \n brachial access was established at the antecubital fossa , with antegrade insertion of a 4-french sheath ( cordis corporation , fremont , ca , usa ) . \n on - table angiogram showed multilevel mid to distal ulnar artery occlusion and severe mid to distal radial artery stenoses . \n all the lesions were passed intraluminally with 0.018/0.014 terumo guidewire ( terumo medical corporration , somerset , nj , usa ) and angioplastized with 2 mm  25 mm medtronic sprinter legend balloon ( medtronic inc , fridley , mn , usa ) . \n completion angiogram showed satisfactory radiological result with some ulnar artery spasm which improved with 50 g of intra - arterial glyceryl trinitrate ( ucb pharma limited , berkshire , uk ) ( figure 1 ) . \n the wound swab grew citrobacter , and her finger infection was controlled by giving unasyn ( ampicillin and sulbactam ) for 2 weeks . \n clopidogrel and aspirin were given for 3 months and then was advised to continue clopidogrel lifelong . \n apart from clinical and duplex ultrasound outcomes , digital pressure was also a good indicator of revascularization , although this was not measured in our patient . \n angioplasty of forearm arteries is a standard treatment in our territory and this paper does not require the institutional review board of the university of hong kong / hospital authority hong kong west cluster to review . \n digital gangrene due to chronic atherosclerotic disease is rare due to low metabolic demand and extensive collateral circulation,10 except in patients with esrf , rheumatological diseases , raynaud s disease , frostbites , or distal emboli . \n patients with renal failure are more prone to develop occlusive disease of the upper limb . \n acceleration of atherosclerosis , upregulation of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress , and more severe calcification of plaques and the arterial media among esrf patients were possible mechanisms.1 steal from ipsilateral concomitant arteriovenous fistulae also contributed to some cases of hand ischemia.11 there is a relative paucity of literature on endovascular treatment of upper extremity arterial disease compared to lower limb , with medical therapy involving antiplatelet agents and lifestyle and risk factor modifications being the mainstay of treatment.12 many patients with septic digital gangrene had primary amputation by the orthopedic services , without preoperative careful vascular assessment or even consideration for revascularization . \n chang et al13 reported 18 forearm bypass procedures for digital ulceration or gangrene with patency rate of 88.9% at mean follow - up of 18 months . \n systematic review of 16 studies reporting outcomes of distal upper extremity bypass surgery showed an overall patency rate of 87% at an average follow - up of 34 months among 152 bypass grafts performed.14 angioplasty is an alternative option given its minimal invasive nature , but there are only a handful of cases described in contemporary literature . \n search keywords comprised angioplasty , percutaneous angioplasty , revascularization and finger gangrene , ischemia , tissue loss . \n all studies using angioplasty as a treatment for finger gangrene due to various etiologies are included and tabulated in table 1 . \n report on long - term efficacy of more than 1 year , however , was lacking . \n the aim of the treatment in our patient was infection control and the gangrenous fingertip was then allowed to autoamputate . \n with improvements in endovascular technology and wide availability of low - profile small balloons , angioplasty of the forearm arteries should be considered for finger salvage in patients with esrf . \n this report emphasized the importance of specialist vascular care with a combination of expert care and angioplasty of forearm arteries , even in delayed setting , with successful salvage of the patient s finger .",

      "document": "renal clear cell carcinomas represent about 3% of all visceral cancers and account for 85% of renal cancers in adults . \n the tumours occur most often in older individuals , usually in the sixth and seventh decades of life , and are often diagnosed at incurable stages . in western countries \n the frequency of renal cancer remains relatively high , there being approximately 30,000 new cases and 12,000 deaths per year from the disease . \n the causes of kidney cancer are believed to be environmental ( such as cigarette smoking , asbestos , petroleum products , heavy metals , unopposed oestrogen therapy , hypertension and obesity ) , genetic or a mixture of both . \n to date there are 19 hereditary syndromes described in which renal cell cancer may occur ( table 1 ) . \n genetic syndromes characterised by an increased risk of renal cancer ( familial cancer database - facd , http://facd.uicc.org ) the identification of genetic predispositions to renal cell cancer remains a priority since knowledge about the underlying molecular genetic basis of the disease will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms giving rise to the disease and , perhaps more importantly , allow for the identification of individuals who are at risk of disease development . \n there are two aspects of these criteria that can be problematic in the clinical setting with respect to the identification of familial renal cell cancer patients . \n the first is the difficulty in fulfilling criteria in countries where large families and extensive pedigrees are impossible to identify , for whatever reason , even though the incidence of hereditary renal cell cancer may be quite high . \n second , the criteria do not take into consideration the existence of family cancer syndromes where renal cell cancer may occur in association with an extra - gastric malignancy . from a clinical perspective \n , there is a necessity to be able to identify hereditary renal cell cancer families with a minimum set of criteria that will provide a high likelihood of ascertainment . \n the aim of this study was to determine whether a minimum set of criteria could be established to identify suspected hereditary renal cell cancer patients when there is restricted information about the familial occurrence of disease . \n a total of 146 clear cell renal carcinoma ( ccrc ) patients comprising 3 groups were enrolled in the study . \n group a ( familial renal cancer ) : comprising 46 patients affected by ccrc from 22 randomly selected families with at least two renal cancers among first or second degree relatives , independent of age at diagnosis of tumours . \n group a1 ( nuclear pedigree ) : comprising 25 patients affected by ccrc from group a. none of the parents of these patients have been diagnosed as affected with renal cell cancer . \n group b : a total of 100 individuals diagnosed with ccrc between the years 1993 and 1997 irrespective of family history were collected from the city of szczecin ( total population 400,000 ) . \n the following inclusion features ( if ) for the identification of suspected hereditary forms of clear cell renal cancer were used and compared against one another for their sensitivity and specificity : if 1 : at least one of the parents of the patient with ccrc was affected by lung cancer if 2 : at least one of the parents of the patient with ccrc was affected by gastric cancer if 3 : ccrc diagnosed at the age of 45 years or younger if 4 : ccrc diagnosed at the age of 50 years or younger if 5 : ccrc diagnosed at the age of 55 years or younger univariate statistical analysis ( chi - squared , odds ratio ( or ) , and sensitivity and specificity of selection were performed using the sas and logit programs . \n univariate statistical analysis ( chi - squared , odds ratio ( or ) , and sensitivity and specificity of selection were performed using the sas and logit programs . \n the comparison of the five ifs was undertaken to identify the most consistent criteria that can be employed in a clinical setting for the identification of suspected hereditary renal cell cancer , based on nuclear pedigree data . \n the first comparison was between group a ( associated with a genetic predisposition to disease ) compared to unselected cases from group b ( table 2 ) . \n the results indicate that all inclusion features are more frequent in group a ( or 1.62 - 4.88 ) . \n the second comparison was performed between group a1 and group b ( table 3 ) . \n the results indicate that there is a very strong correlation between hereditary ( familial ) predisposition to ccrc and occurrence of at least one of the following ifs : if1 , if2 or if5 - or 13.4 ; p < 0.00001 . \n the recognition of features that can be used for the identification of familial predispositions to ccrc in situations where extensive pedigree analysis is unknown or impossible to ascertain but the prevalence of the disease is relatively high in the population will aid in the identification of individuals at increased risk of developing ccrc . by using the criteria \n described herein and the consequent recognition of significant odds ratios for some of the inclusion features to identify ccrc families , we believe that the identification of additional genes associated with this malignancy will be expedited . \n of particular interest are the odds ratio values for the inclusion features if5 between groups a1 and b and if 1 between groups a1 and b , which were relatively high ( 6.21 and 6.09 , respectively ) . \n since these inclusion features are significant we have a relatively high degree of confidence that the reported observations are not biased and are an accurate reflection of the validity of our approach for the identification of hereditary ccrc families . \n indeed , these criteria have been tested in our outpatient clinics to successfully identify hereditary ccrc . therefore if we have families matching if1 or if2 or if5 , we are confident that a diagnosis of familial ccrc can be made . at present \n it seems reasonable to offer the option of ultrasonography examination to all individuals identified by the use of our inclusion features beginning at the age of 5 to 10 years before the youngest ccrc identified within the patient 's family . \n such surveillance should only be an option and not a recommendation because the efficiency of such management procedures has not been rigorously determined to reduce morbidity and/or mortality . \n with respect to surveillance the real value of this will have to be established by studies on large cohorts of individuals from families matching pedigree and clinical criteria of suspected hereditary ccrc with identified constitutional dna variants associated with genetic predispositions . \n so far , the list of genetic changes associated with ccrc is somewhat limited but should be extended in the near future as more knowledge is gained about the genetic factors associated with altered ccrc predisposition . in summary , we advocate the use of our criteria for suspected hereditary clear cell renal cancer identified in this report in order to : a. offer an ultrasound examination option , b. create repositories of nuclear clear cell renal cancer families for future studies on the efficiency of surveillance for individuals with genetic predispositions to renal cancer , c. perform further studies to aid in the identification of genetic factors associated with ccrc .",

      "document": "tis education forms the common mind ; just as the twig is bent , the tree s inclined  , wrote alexander pope in 1734 . \n this is likely one of the earliest poetic descriptions of a current topic of great interest to psychiatrists and research neuroscientists , namely the impact of early psychosocial factors on subsequent neuronal development and ultimate phenotypic presentation . \n michael meaney and colleagues at mcgill university have demonstrated , in an elegant series of experiments in rats , the effect of early maternal grooming of rat pups on stress resilience via hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression and activation of nerve growth factor inducible - a . \n offspring interactions can dramatically influence the child s behavior as they age.1 the focus of this study is to examine retrospectively the potential relationship between maternal personality characteristics , as measured by the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory ( mmpi ) , and drug dependence in their sons . \n the hypothesis is that certain personality traits in mothers may help predict an at - risk population of their sons for the development of drug dependence . \n this preliminary work is intended to explore a potential translational aspect of the work of meaney and others . \n bucknall and robertson,2 have demonstrated the role of family in the etiology of drug abuse , with an even greater role in the maintenance of an individual s drug dependence . \n andersson and eisemann,3 confirmed that a parental rearing behavior perceived both as rejecting and overprotective represents a link between dysfunctional parenting and the development of maladaptive psychosocial behaviors , like drug addiction . \n drug addicts often come from families where there is frequently expressed ill will and hostility in the home . \n they have weaker family ties than do those who do not take drugs . in families \n in which there was contact with drugs , authority belonged to the mother to a greater degree than the father.4 handlarz et al5 studied drug addicts and their families and observed general characteristics common to all substance - dependent patients . among these were vulnerability of personality and ego weakness , absent father , narcissistic mother , disaggregation of the family , and pathological communication among family members . \n graeven and schaef 6 reported the relationship with the opposite sex parent had the strongest impact on both male and female heroin users . \n kaufamn7 studied the family structure of drug addicts and their families who were in residential treatment at the time of the study . \n the most common familial pattern seen was that of a mother enmeshed with her addicted son . \n the father reported feeling excluded by the dyad and reacted with disengagement , brutality , or increased consumption of alcohol . \n this paper examines the personality of mothers and its relationship to severity of addiction of their sons . \n it is a follow up to our previous work on childhood parenting styles of the substance - dependent patient.8 \n patients were diagnosed according to diagnostic statistical manual ( dsm iv).9 the control group consisted of 35 mothers of non - drug - dependent subjects . \n mothers from both groups fulfilled the following inclusion criteria : \n age between 40 and 60.not suffering substance use disorders or any other psychiatric disorders.not suffering significant medical disorder . \n age between 40 and 60 . not suffering substance use disorders or any other psychiatric disorders . \n all study subjects were informed they were participating in a volunteer study examining the relationship between a mother s personality and drug dependence in their children . \n all study participants provided informed consent to a psychiatrist ( sa ) member of the study team . \n both groups were administered the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory ( mmpi),10 which is a self - reported inventory developed in 1937 by starke hanthaway and charnley mckinley . \n the items of each scale were selected for their ability to separate medical and psychiatric patients from normal control subjects . \n we applied the arabic version prepared by melika et al.10 substance - dependent patients were assessed with the addiction severity index ( asi).11 the asi is a semi - structured interview designed to address 7 potential problem areas in substance use disorder patients : medical status , employment and support , drug use , alcohol use , legal status , family / social status , and psychiatric status . in 1 hour , a skilled interviewer can gather information on recent ( past 30 days ) and lifetime problems in all of the problem areas . \n the asi provided an overview of problems related to substance , rather than focusing on any single area . \n personality profiles of mothers of both groups were compared , and those of mothers of dependent patients were correlated to the 7 dimensions of the asi . \n differences between quantitative variables for the addicts group and the control group were assessed using student s t - test . \n the mmpi scales for mothers were classified into risk grades and differences between the study groups were assessed using pearson s chi - square test . \n the association between the different study scales for mother and their offspring was assessed using correlation analysis . \n the mean age of mothers of patients was 50 , while that of the control was 44.8 years . \n they were age matched ( p = 0.07 ) there were significant differences between both groups on depression , hysteria , and paranoia scales of the mmpi . \n depression scores were higher than 70 ( pathological ) in 8% of study group compared to only 1% of control group . \n depression scores were in the normal range ( 45 to 50 ) in 5% of study group compared to 22% of the control group ( p = 0.003 ) . \n scores on the hysteria scale were higher than 70 in 4% of study group compared to none of the control group . \n negative scores for hysteria were seen in 15% of the study group , compared to 40% of the control group ( p = 0.02 ) . \n paranoia scale scores were positive in 4% of the study group , compared to 1% of controls ( p = 0.03 ) . \n no paranoia was detected in 10% of the study group , compared to 40% of controls . \n no significant differences were reported on any of the other mmpi scales ( table 1 ) . \n significant positive correlations were observed among mothers of substance - dependent patients on scores of depression , hypochondrias , and psychopathic deviance ( p = 0.003 , and p = 0.01 respectively ) . \n a positive correlation was also detected between scores of hysteria , hypochondrias and psychopathic deviance ( p = 0.001 and p = 0.004 , respectively ) , and between paranoia and hypochondrias , depression , and psychopathic deviance ( p = 0.005 , p = 0.01 , and p = 0.01 , respectively ) . \n pearson s correlation coefficient was calculated to measure the degree of association between mmpi scores and the asi . \n results showed significant positive correlation between scores of hysteria and psychopathic deviance and asi legal status impairment ( p = 0.023 and p = 0.019 , respectively ) . \n there was a significant negative correlation between social introversion and asi scores of drug / alcohol use , and family history ( p = 0.007 and p = 0.003 , respectively ) . \n significant positive correlations were observed between scores of social status impairment and those of psychiatric and legal status impairment ( p= 0.005 and p = 0.04 , respectively ) . \n the role of parenting in the development of drug abuse is a widely discussed topic . \n this is best demonstrated by 2,590,000 google hits displayed when  the role of parenting on drug abuse  is searched . \n behavioral scientists appreciated the highly complex nature of parental interactions , particularly maternal , and have demonstrated the role of nurturing in early life to the development of pathophysiologic functioning in later years of the offspring . \n schweitzer and lawton12 and brook et al1 have independently reported mothers assessed as cold , indifferent , controlling , and intrusive were a major risk factor for the development of adolescent drug use . \n similarly , andersson and eisemann3 reported that parenting perceived as rejecting was linked to maladaptive psychosocial behaviors , including drug abuse . \n our previous study confirmed these findings8 and demonstrated that substance - abusing patients had lower maternal protection scores than non - drug - abusing controls . \n this analysis of maternal mmpi scores in addicted offspring demonstrated a statistically significant correlation in the depression , hysteria and paranoia subscales . \n these results have significant health , mental health , and public health and health policy implications . \n the cost of drug abuse and addiction to the patient , their family , and society is enormous . \n any primary interventions which might decrease pathologic drug use would be beneficial . these and other data strongly support the importance of early mother  child assessment and intervention when clinically indicated . although the role of family varies somewhat based on cultural norms , the effect of early maternal nurturing on neuronal development and subsequent phenotypic expression is not affected by socio - cultural variations . \n it is far more effective to work with mothers than to treat drug addiction in their grown children . \n future research needs to focus on identifying cost - effective and clinically effective early intervention strategies through prospective , longitudinal trials . \n clinical translational research drawing on results from pre - clinical reports will also be valuable .",
      "summary": "drug addicts often come from dysfunctional families . \n the prevailing view in the literature is that mothers of drug - dependent patients can be characterized by strong emotional bonds and overprotection . \n studies suggest that maternal rejection could be a major risk factor of developing drug addiction . \n this work is a continuation of our previous study of childhood parenting experiences of substance - dependent patients . \n the aims were to compare the personality profile of mothers of substance - dependent patients and that of mothers of matched control subjects ; and to examine the relation between the personality of mothers of addicts , and severity of their offspring s addiction . \n the study group consisted of 20 mothers of substance - dependent patients and a control group of 35 mothers of non - dependent subjects ; mothers of both groups were age matched . \n patients were diagnosed according to dsm iv criteria . \n personalities of mothers of both groups were assessed using the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory ( mmpi ) . \n substance - dependent patients ( sons ) were administered the addiction severity index ( asi ) . \n the mean scores of the mmpi scales were higher for mothers of dependent patients compared to mothers of non - dependent subjects . \n scores on the depression , hysteria and paranoia scales were significantly higher for mothers of patients ( p = 0.03 , 0.02 , and 0.03 , respectively ) . \n there was a significant positive correlation between scores of hysteria , and psychopathic deviance and the asi ( p = 0.03 and 0.01 , respectively ) . \n there were significant negative correlations between scores of social introversion and the asi drug / alcohol use status ( p = 0.007 ) , and family history dimensions ( p = 0.003 ) . \n mothers of substance - dependent patients showed disturbances in aspects of personalities that might be related to initiation of perpetuation of substance dependence .",

DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee on \n        Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the \n        Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n            (2) Government of sudan.--The term ``Government of Sudan'' \n        means Sudan's Government of National Unity. Such term does not \n        include the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS).\n            (3) SPLM.--The term ``SPLM'' means the Sudan People's \n        Liberation Movement.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Government rightfully declared the \n        atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan to be genocide. More \n        than 450,000 people have been killed and an estimated 2,500,000 \n        people have been displaced since the crisis erupted in 2003.\n            (2) The Government of Sudan continues to commit atrocities \n        against innocent civilians in Darfur. According to a March 25, \n        2008, report by the United Nations Secretary-General, \n        ``increased hostilities in Western Darfur over the reporting \n        period have led to significant displacement and loss of \n        civilian life, while also inhibiting humanitarian access to \n        civilian populations affected by the fighting''.\n            (3) In October 2007, the Government of Southern Sudan \n        suspended the participation of its ministers, state ministers, \n        and presidential advisors from Sudan's Government of National \n        Unity to protest measures taken by the National Congress Party \n        and to demand full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \n        Agreement (CPA).\n            (4) Implementation of the CPA by the Government of National \n        Unity has been selective and at times deliberately slow. The \n        Government of Sudan has not yet implemented the Abyei Boundary \n        Commission (ABC) recommendations. The ABC was mandated to \n        ``define and demarcate'' the area known as the 9 Ngok Dinka \n        Chiefdoms transferred in 1905 to Kordofan in North Sudan.\n            (5) The ABC was chaired by former United States Ambassador \n        to Sudan Donald Peterson, with active international engagement. \n        In July 2005, the ABC submitted its final report to the Sudan's \n        presidency. According to the CPA, ``upon presentation of the \n        final report, the Presidency shall take necessary action to put \n        the special administration status of Abyei Area into immediate \n        effect''.\n            (6) According to a September 2007 report by the United \n        Nations Secretary-General, the lack of administration in Abyei \n        has hampered CPA activities and left gaps in policing, public \n        sanitation, and health services. Continued intransigence on \n        this issue is likely to lead to war.\n            (7) The Government of Sudan is well known to signing peace \n        agreements and make commitments but has consistently failed to \n        honor these agreements.\n            (8) Efforts to hold individuals accountable for the \n        genocide in Darfur have not been successful in large part \n        because the Government of Sudan refuses to cooperate with the \n        International Criminal Court (ICC) and protects indicted \n        individuals by the ICC.\n            (9) In April 2008, Special Envoy Richard Williamson and a \n        Government of Sudan delegation led by Nafi Ali Nafi, a man \n        responsible for many of Sudan's international terror links and \n        domestic atrocities, met in Rome to discuss normalization of \n        relations between Sudan and the United States.\n            (10) Nafi Ali Nafi was the security chief when Sudan gave \n        safe haven to Osama bin Laden in the 1990s, a period when Bin \n        Laden began to build his terror network. Nafi was also a key \n        player in support of Gama'a Islamia, a group that tried to \n        assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The weapons used \n        in the assassination attempt were reportedly flown by Sudan \n        Airways, and after the failed attempt, one of the assassins was \n        flown to Sudan on Sudan Airways.\n\nSEC. 4. CODIFICATION OF EXISTING SANCTIONS IN SUPPORT OF A JUST AND \n              LASTING PEACE IN SUDAN.\n\n    (a) In General.--Sanctions against the Government of Sudan that \nwere imposed pursuant to any provision of law, as in effect on the date \nof the enactment of this Act, including sanctions against the \nGovernment of Sudan that were imposed pursuant to any executive order \nor other administrative action, shall remain in effect against the \nGovernment of Sudan and shall not be lifted pursuant to such provisions \nof law until the President certifies to the appropriate congressional \ncommittees that the Government of Sudan has met the conditions \ndescribed in subsection (b) for a period of not less than one year.\n    (b) Conditions Described.--The conditions referred to in subsection \n(a) are the following:\n            (1) The Government of Sudan fully implements the \n        Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and the Darfur Peace \n        Agreement (DPA).\n            (2) The Abyei Boundary Commission (ABC) recommendations are \n        implemented and oil revenue shares are paid retroactively.\n            (3) The Government of Sudan hands over to the International \n        Criminal Court (ICC) all indicted individuals without any \n        delay.\n            (4) The Government of Sudan ends its atrocities against \n        innocent civilians in Darfur and other parts of Sudan.\n            (5) The Government of Sudan allows the deployment of the \n        United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) forces \n        and allows unhindered access to humanitarian workers.\n            (6) The Government of Sudan ends its ties with known \n        terrorist organizations and individuals.\n            (7) Senior officials in the Government of Sudan are held \n        accountable for crimes committed in the Nuba, South Sudan, \n        Southern Blue Nile, and Eastern Sudan.\n            (8) Senior officials in the Government of Sudan are held \n        accountable for their support for Osama bin Laden and other \n        terrorist groups.\n    (c) Monitoring Mechanism.--The President of the United States shall \nestablish a mechanism to monitor and ensure that the Government of \nSudan is meeting the conditions described in subsection (b).\n    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \nStates Government should not normalize relations with the Government of \nSudan until the conditions described in subsection (b) have been \nimplemented for a period of not less than one year as described in \nsubsection (a).",

      "document": "thalassemia major has long remained in the domain of pediatricians but advances in medical science and improved health care have contributed to the longevity of life and its quality ; to the extent that it now needs attention of the adult physicians too . as of today , most physicians do not have to encounter thalassemics as their patients . \n it is surprising that a medline search reveals less than 10 articles on topics concerning adult thalassemia . \n there is a severe resource data crunch at a time when information needs to be readily available to the physicians , the emphasis being on  evidence - based medicine . \n this study aims to evaluate the clinical profile of thalassemia major patients surviving into adulthood so as to orient the physicians and the general practitioners to adult thalassemia patients . \n the study included all adult patients of thalassemia ( > 18 years old ) who are attending the adult thalassemia care unit ( department of medicine ) for their management . \n the department of pediatrics at our institute , which happens to be a tertiary institute , runs a thalassemia day care unit , wherein about 250 patients regularly receive transfusion and all patients who attain 18 years of age are referred to adult thalassemia care unit ( department of medicine ) for management , from where these data are being reported . \n all patients were evaluated clinically and investigated for complete blood counts , serum urea , creatinine , bilirubin ( total and direct ) , alanine and aspartate transaminases , alkaline phosphatase , total protein and albumin , fasting and postprandial plasma glucose , serum ferritin , and thyroid hormone levels . \n all the patients were receiving packed cell transfusions for at least 15 years with the aim to keep the hemoglobin levels at about 10 g / dl . \n unpaired student 's t - test was used to ascertain difference in clinical features between male and female thalassemia patients . \n a total of 19 thalassemia patients were above the age of 18 years and were availing regular transfusion services at fortnightly intervals . \n as is evident from the table , the height in both the male and female subjects was quite lower than the usual height in indian adults . \n only three males and one female had a height exceeding 150 cm , the maximum height achieved by a male subject being 168 cm and for the female 151 cm . \n the average height in male thalassemics was significantly higher than that in females ( unpaired t - test , p=0.023 ) . despite the fact , the height was below average , the bmi was < 18.5 in eight thalassemia patients ( 42.1% ) and only one ( 5.3% ) had a bmi>25 i.e. 25.44 . \n clinical features of thalassemia patients nearly half of the patients ( 47.4% ) had undergone splenectomy by the time they reached their adulthood . interestingly , \n 72% males had undergone splenectomy as compared to 12.5% female thalassemics ( unpaired t - test , p=0.005 ) . \n average hemoglobin was similar in both male and female subjects but six ( 31.6% ) had their hemoglobin levels < 8 g / dl . \n average leukocyte counts were higher in males ( unpaired student 's t - test , p=0.0058 ) . \n moreover , two ( 18.2% ) males and four ( 50% ) females had total leukocyte counts < 4000/mm . \n surprisingly , no patient had achieved the recommended serum ferritin levels of < 1000 ng / ml . \n in fact , serum urea , creatinine , total proteins , and albumin levels were within the normal range for all patients . \n four patients ( 21.1% ) had serum bilirubin levels > 1.5 mg/ dl with a predominant indirect hyperbilirubinemia . \n one patient was positive for both hepatitis b and c virus infections and three others were only positive for hcv and one other harbored hiv infection . in total five ( 26.3% ) patients were harboring at least one of the three infections . \n four ( 21.1% ) of the patients were receiving a combination of two iron - chelating drugs - deferiprone and desferrioxamine , while the remaining were receiving only deferiprone . \n average dose of deferiprone being administered to each patient was 958 mg / kg body weight daily in divided doses . \n thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and thalassemia major manifests as severe anemia in infancy or childhood and used to be incompatible with life in the absence of regular red cell transfusions . \n however , hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) has offered a prospect of cure with a normal life expectancy and quality of life , relief from life - long blood transfusions and its attendant complications . \n short of hsct , thalassemia major patients need a two - pronged therapy in the form of  transfusion \n it is only thalassemia minor / trait which may be diagnosed in adulthood and does not carry a great clinical significance being asymptomatic in majority of individuals . \n however , with increasing number of thalassemia major patients surviving through their adolescence into adulthood , adult physicians should brace themselves to face the challenge of dealing with thalassemia in their adult patients . \n what adult thalassemics will be like  has been presented in this article . in spite of improvements in transfusion practices and availability of effective iron chelators , the life of thalassemia patients \n the complications relate to inadequate transfusions , inadequate chelation , transfusion - transmitted viral infections , allosensitization , iron overload and its consequences of endocrine , cardiac , hepatic disturbance ; iron - chelator - related drug toxicities ; osteoporosis and psychosocial problems.[24 ] lack of proper and trained medical expertise , periodic requirement of safe and adequate packed red cell concentrates high cost of in - line leukocyte - depleting filters and iron - chelator drugs ; and poor compliance with blood transfusions , periodic monitoring , and regular chelation pose other major hurdles for the thalassemics . \n inadequate transfusions are a rule rather than the exception in india resulting in hypersplenism and greater rates of splenectomy . \n a total of 31.6% patients had hemoglobin levels < 8 g / dl and 47.4% adult thalassemics had undergone splenectomy in the present study . \n however , this finding could not be corroborated because of lack of similar published studies . \n the high total leukocyte counts observed in males can be explained as a consequence to splenectomy . \n the low average height , weight , and the bmi in both males and females are signs of growth failure commonly seen in inadequately chelated beta - thalassemics . \n normal serum protein and albumin levels rule out protein energy malnutrition as a cause of growth failure . \n serum ferritin levels were high in all patients , a testimony to inadequate chelation in this group . \n this is despite the fact that all thalassemics were receiving iron chelation , either deferiprone alone or in combination with desferrioxamine . \n even the average dose of deferiprone while being used as monotherapy was 95 mg / kg / day ( range being 85114 mg / kg / day ) against the recommended dose of 75 mg / kg / day in divided doses . in fact \n , one study citing that deferiprone was not found sufficiently effective at the recommended dose of 75 mg / kg / day , tried a high dose of 100 mg / kg / day for 2 years and found it to be safe and effective . \n however , in the present study in adult thalassemics , deferiprone is not effectively chelating even at this high dose , so a higher dose may need to be tried or patients shifted to alternative iron chelators like deferasirox . \n repeated blood transfusions are associated with the serious risk of transmission of chronic viral infections , which were observed in 26.3% of the cases in the present series . \n antibodies to hepatitis c virus were observed in 21% cases and the same figure has been reported from indian thalassemics . \n average serum transaminase values are higher than normal in the present study and can be attributable to chronic viral hepatitis . \n the absence of diabetes , hypothyroidism , cardiac arrhythmias in the present cohort can possibly be explained by the young age ( early adulthood ) , since these are a consequence of iron overload and the prevalence therefore increases with the number of blood transfusions and so with the age . \n indeed , one indian study did not report diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in chronically transfused patients of thalassemia major between 8 and 15 years of age . \n however , cardiac involvement can not be entirely ruled out since it requires echocardiography and mri to see for the functional and structural effects of iron overload , respectively . \n osteoporosis and osteopenia are extremely frequent in thalassemia affecting from 52% to 96% of patients and the prevalence rises with age . \n echocardiography , mri , and dexa scan were not performed for the thalassemia patients in the preceding 1 year and could not be done as part of the study in view of cost constraints . \n this study presents a profile of the adult thalassemia subjects and provides insight into the problems and complications faced by them despite several medical advances . \n the onus of dealing with these lies squarely with the adult physician and it is imperative for one and all to be aware of these .",
      "summary": "background : effective transfusion and chelation have prolonged the quality and longevity of life in thalassemics , who now survive into adulthood . hence , adult physicians need to be aware of their clinical and laboratory profile and the problems faced by them.aim:the present study was aimed to evaluate the clinical profile of adult thalassemics.materials and methods : adult ( > 18 years ) thalassemia major patients ( n=19 ) were evaluated clinically and fasting pretransfusion blood samples were analyzed for complete blood counts , kidney and liver function tests , plasma glucose , serum ferritin , and thyroid hormone levels.results:average age was 21.652.47 years ( range 1928 years ) , 42.1% had body mass index ( bmi ) < 18.5 . \n splenectomy had been performed in 47.4% before reaching adulthood , males significantly outnumbered females ( 72% vs. 12.5% ) . hemoglobin levels < 8 g / dl were observed in 31.6% and none had serum ferritin levels in the recommended range suggesting inadequacy of both transfusion and chelation . \n indirect hyperbilirubinemia was observed in 21.1% patients although kidney functions , serum protein , and albumin were normal in all patients . \n electrocardiographic abnormalities , diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism were absent . \n five patients ( 26.3% ) had contracted transfusion - transmitted viral infections \n 21.1% and 5.3% respectively had antibodies to hepatitis c virus and hiv , while 5.3% were positive for australia antigen . \n all patients were receiving chelation therapy \n deferiprone alone ( 78.9% ) or along with desferrioxamine ( 21.1% ) . \n average dose of deferiprone being used was 958 mg / kg.conclusion : adult thalassemia major patients present with a distinct clinical profile having low bmi , generalized hyperpigmentation , most are splenectomized , have low hemoglobin , inadequate chelation and harbor transfusion - transmitted infections . \n adult physician needs to be aware of this profile .",

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) When Zimbabwe achieved independence in 1980, its \n        economic and democratic prospects were bright and President \n        Robert Mugabe was hailed as a liberator. However, 27 years \n        later, the economy of Zimbabwe has collapsed as income per \n        capita has fallen below the 1953 level and President Mugabe's \n        Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) \n        government has increasingly and systematically exercised \n        repression of political opposition and engaged in violations of \n        human rights.\n            (2) The Department of State's 2006 Country Report on Human \n        Rights Practices states that Zimbabwe's 2002 presidential \n        election and 2005 parliamentary elections were neither free nor \n        fair, and reports that President Mugabe's government interfered \n        with the campaign activities of the opposition, intimidated \n        voters, and distributed food in a partisan manner.\n            (3) The Department of State Report also finds that the \n        Government of Zimbabwe continues to--\n                    (A) restrict freedom of assembly, movement, and \n                association;\n                    (B) forcibly evict civilians from their land; and\n                    (C) harass and abuse members of the opposition, the \n                media, the religious community, civil society, and \n                organized labor.\n            (4) According to the Freedom House Freedom in the World \n        2007 report, ``In 2006, Zimbabwe suffered from a further \n        deterioration of political rights and civil liberties amid a \n        near-total collapse of the country's economy.''.\n            (5) Zimbabwe is a member of the United Nations, the African \n        Union, the Southern African Development Community, the African \n        Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the \n        World Trade Organization, and a party to the Universal \n        Declaration of Human Rights, the African Charter on Human and \n        Peoples' Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and \n        Political Rights.\n            (6) Section 2 of the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic \n        Recovery Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-99; 22 U.S.C. 2151 note) \n        states, ``It is the policy of the United States to support the \n        people of Zimbabwe in their struggle to effect peaceful, \n        democratic change, achieve broad-based and equitable economic \n        growth, and restore the rule of law.''.\n            (7) In 2002 and 2003, the United States imposed financial \n        and immigration sanctions targeted against selected \n        individuals, a ban on the transfer of defense items and \n        services, and a suspension of nonhumanitarian government-to-\n        government assistance, although the United States remains one \n        of the leading providers of humanitarian assistance to the \n        people of Zimbabwe.\n            (8) The United Nations, the European Union, the United \n        States, human rights organizations, and many others have \n        condemned the security forces of Zimbabwe for the beating, \n        detention, and arrest of opposition and civil society members \n        attending a prayer meeting on March 11, 2007.\n            (9) In March 2007, the heads of state of the Southern \n        African Development Community announced that the President of \n        South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, will mediate between President \n        Mugabe and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change in \n        advance of the 2008 presidential election, but failed to \n        condemn the Government of Zimbabwe for its human rights abuses \n        and restriction of democratic space.\n            (10) On March 30, 2007, it was announced that the ZANU-PF \n        central committee had chosen President Mugabe as the party's \n        candidate for the 2008 election and that the parliamentary \n        elections will also be held in 2008, instead of 2010.\n            (11) A Human Rights Watch report released in May 2007 \n        concluded, ``Arbitrary arrests, detentions, and brutal beatings \n        by police and security forces skyrocketed in March and April, \n        and continue unabated. . . . The Zimbabwean government is \n        violating the human rights of its citizens with impunity.''.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to support the people of Zimbabwe in their efforts to \n        promote democracy and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe; and\n            (2) to call on President Mugabe to immediately restore \n        democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE.\n\n    The following is the sense of Congress:\n            (1) The United States welcomes and commends the \n        announcement by the Southern African Development Community that \n        the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, will lead \n        negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties in \n        Zimbabwe to resolve the political and humanitarian crisis in a \n        way that reflects the will of the people of Zimbabwe and \n        respects international standards.\n            (2) The creation of a level playing field for those who \n        want to participate in the political process in Zimbabwe and \n        the encouragement of transparency in the political process \n        should be priority objectives in the negotiations.\n            (3) All preparations should be made to hold free, fair, and \n        peaceful elections in accordance with international standards, \n        such as the Southern African Development Community \n        Parliamentary Forum Election Norms and Guidelines.\n            (4) Cooperation between the United States, regional players \n        in Africa, and the wider international community is an \n        important component of a proactive strategy to support \n        democratic rule and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe.\n            (5) Normalized relations with the Government of Zimbabwe \n        are desirable, but until the Government of Zimbabwe promotes \n        democracy and the rule of law, the United States will continue \n        to isolate the Government of Zimbabwe and expand financial and \n        travel sanctions targeted against those responsible for \n        repressing the people of Zimbabwe.\n            (6) The United States Permanent Representative to the \n        United Nations should use the voice and vote of the United \n        States in the United Nations Security Council to emphasize the \n        threat to international peace and security posed by the \n        Government of Zimbabwe.\n\nSEC. 5.

      "summary": "Consumer Protection and Choice Act This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit a deferred presentment transaction except as provided under this Act.  A \"deferred presentment transaction\" is one in which currency or other payment is provided to a consumer in exchange for a consumer's check or other payment instrument and an agreement that such check or payment instrument shall be held for a deferment period prior to presentment, deposit, or redemption. If the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) determines that a state has in effect a law that provides for the licensing of deferred presentment providers and the regulation of deferred presentment transactions, and that meets the requirements specified by this Act, any CFPB regulations concerning such transactions and providers shall not apply in such state.  Such a state law must:   require a provider to be licensed by the state; establish a transaction database;  require a provider to verify through such database that a consumer entering into such a transaction does not have an outstanding transaction;  require a provider to report immediately to such database information about each transaction entered into and each transaction paid or settled; require that a transaction agreement be in writing and allow the consumer to rescind the agreement within the first 24 hours;  require a transaction agreement to limit the interest and fees to no more that 10% of the transaction amount, the processing fee to $5, the transaction amount to $500, and the duration of the transaction to no less than 7 days and no more than 31 days; and  allow a 60-day grace period after the contractual repayment date for a consumer to repay the amount due, subject to early termination if a consumer fails to complete a course with a consumer credit counseling agency.  The bill makes these changes effective 24 months after enactment and prohibits the CFPB from establishing or enforcing any regulation governing deferred presentment transactions or payday loans during such period.",

related impairment , medical complications , family support , and \n discharge \n destination predict the length of stay3 . \n in another previous study , impairment , activities of daily living ( adl ) , unplanned \n discharges , and discharge to facilities affected the length of stay4 . on the other hand , \n similarly , patient - related factors were found to affect rehabilitation outcome , whereas \n illness- and intervention - related factors did not6 . \n this behavior pattern \n includes impatience , urgency , aggressiveness , and particularity about details . \n the type a \n behavior pattern is regarded as an independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases7 . \n however , patients with type a behavior \n pattern characteristics may have better compliance with rehabilitation and other forms of \n medical and social support than those with non - type a behavior . \n if patients with the type a \n behavior pattern have better compliance , they would have a shorter length of hospital stay \n than those with non - type a behavior . to examine this hypothesis , in this study , we compared \n the length of stay of patients with the type a behavior pattern with that of patients with a \n non - type a behavior pattern . \n we hypothesized that length of stay of patients with the type a \n behavior pattern would be shorter than that of patients with a non - type a behavior \n pattern . \n fifty - seven patients participated in this study . all patients had stayed in the \n comprehensive rehabilitation unit of omaezaki municipal hospital between april and december \n 2013 . \n the exclusion criteria were as follows : transfer to another hospital , medical \n facility , or welfare facility during the research term and refusal to provide informed \n consent . \n type a behavior pattern was assessed by an abbreviated set of 12 questions developed by \n maeda8 . \n hardly  were scored as 2 , 1 , and 0 points , respectively , for nine \n questions , and the points were doubled for three questions . \n a total score of 17 or greater \n was defined as type a , and the other subjects were defined as non - type a. after the subjects \n were discharged , we counted the number of days between admission and discharge to evaluate \n the length of stay . to evaluate the ability to perform adl at discharge , we measured barthel \n index for all patients . \n we used the student s t - test to examine statistical differences in \n length of stay and barthel index at discharge between subjects with type a behavior and \n those without type a behavior . \n we analyzed these measurements by statistical package for social sciences ( spss ) \n version 19 . \n ultimately , 55 subjects ( 75.311.7  years old , 18 males and 37 females ) were classified into \n either the type a group ( n = 26 ) or the non -

related \n factors5 , especially psychological \n factors6 , affect rehabilitation \n outcomes . \n the subjects in this study were patients who stayed in a comprehensive \n rehabilitation unit . \n patients who stay in a comprehensive rehabilitation unit do not require \n much medical care and are able to focus on rehabilitation . \n hence , our data suggest that \n psychological factors of the patients , such as type a behavior , affect rehabilitation \n compliance . \n length of stay , ability to perform adl at discharge , and patient age influence \n rehabilitation outcome and whether patients can return home or not10 , 11 . \n there was no significant difference in \n barthel index or patient age between patients with the type a behavior pattern and those \n with a non - type a behavior pattern . \n thus , it appears likely that ability to perform adl at \n discharge , patient age , and destination at discharge do not influence length of stay . \n the type a behavior pattern includes impatience , urgency , aggressiveness , and particularity \n about details . \n patients who have higher levels of physical activity during rehabilitation \n were associated with a shorter length of stay12 . because patients with the type a behavior pattern might have good \n compliance with rehabilitation and increase their physical activity \n the type a behavior pattern is well known to be an independent \n risk factor of cardiovascular diseases7 . \n also in the japanese , the type a behavior pattern is associated with an increased risk of \n acute myocardial infarction , especially in women13 . \n so , the type a behavior pattern may be considered not a good \n characteristics in general . \n in contrast , another article reported that the type a behavior \n pattern reduced the risk of coronary heart diseases in japanese men14 . \n japanese men who do not express their anger may have an \n increased risk of high blood pressure15 . \n this previous article indicates that non - type a japanese men may have a higher hypertension \n risk than type a japanese men . in the japanese , the type \n our results also show that patients with the type a \n behavior pattern may be able to return home early . \n finally , the cause of a short length of stay may not \n be rehabilitation compliance . \n in conclusion , our results suggest that the type a behavior pattern shortens the length of \n hospital stay . \n the data show that we should consider the patient s characteristics in \n rehabilitation to protect the patient and for financial benefit .",

Gavin Newsom and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi when he said his former team should be sitting McDonald while the legal process plays out.\n\n\u201cHe should be off that football field,\u201d Rice said to CNN. \u201cHe should not have the opportunity to continue playing right now. Domestic violence \u2014 it\u2019s a very touchy conversation. But it\u2019s something that we have to address and we have to deal with.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, head coach Jim Harbaugh said the organization wouldn\u2019t be swayed by outside pressure.\n\n\u201cOur response would be we have two principles at play here,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cOne is respect for due process, and we\u2019re not going to flinch based on public speculation.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh, general manager Trent Baalke and CEO Jed York have stated the 49ers have a zero-tolerance policy for those who engage in domestic violence. McDonald, who was arrested Aug. 31 and released on $25,000 bond, has not been charged with a crime and the San Jose Police Department\u2019s investigation is ongoing.\n\nIn that sense, McDonald\u2019s situation differs from other domestic-violence cases involving NFL players. Former Baltimore running back Ray Rice, Carolina defensive end Greg Hardy and Arizona running back Jonathan Dwyer have had charges brought against them.\n\nRice has been released by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL. Hardy, who is appealing his conviction, has been placed on the exempt commissioner\u2019s permission list and can\u2019t practice or play for the Panthers. Dwyer, who was arrested Wednesday, has been deactivated by the Cardinals.",

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More than \\2/3\\ of Earth's surface is covered by \n        oceans.\n            (2) The oceans and marine waters contain a greater variety \n        of forms of life than exists on land, and scientists are \n        continually discovering new forms of life in previously \n        unexplored, unique habitats.\n            (3) The earth's human population is dependent upon the \n        products of the oceans for income, nutrition, medicines, raw \n        materials, and valuable natural services such as climate \n        regulation, flood control, and storm surge protection.\n            (4) The practice and technology of bottom trawling and use \n        of other mobile fishing gear on the seabed has increased to the \n        point that an area of seabed twice the size of the contiguous \n        United States is affected by these practices each year.\n            (5) These practices result in a loss of biological \n        diversity, which is detrimental not only to the ocean \n        environment itself but also to the industries and people that \n        depend on that environment.\n            (6) Little is known about the recoverability of the seabed \n        from the effects of bottom trawling and use of other mobile \n        fishing gear on the seabed.

      "document": "Taxpayers who elect to itemize their deductions may reduce their federal income tax liability by claiming a deduction for certain state and local taxes paid, often called the \"SALT deduction.\" The 2017 tax revision (commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, TCJA; P.L. 115-97 ) established a temporary $10,000 limit, or \"SALT cap,\" on annual SALT deduction claims. By limiting the amount of the SALT deduction, the SALT cap increases the tax liability of certain taxpayers, which increases federal tax revenues relative to what otherwise would have been collected without a limitation in place. The SALT cap's effect on tax liability varies significantly with taxpayer income and with state and local tax rates. A number of bills introduced in the 116 th Congress would modify the SALT cap, and federal regulatory efforts responding to related state and local government activity are ongoing. This report discusses the SALT cap's features, analyzes its potential impact, and summarizes recent legislation and regulatory action to modify the cap. Under current law, taxpayers itemizing deductions (in lieu of claiming the standard deduction) may reduce their taxable income by claiming the SALT deduction for certain state and local taxes paid during the tax year. The state and local taxes eligible for the SALT deduction are income taxes, sales taxes (claimed in lieu of income taxes), personal property taxes, and certain real property taxes not paid in the carrying on of a trade or business. For taxpayers who would have itemized deductions without access to the SALT deduction, it generates tax savings equal to the amount deducted multiplied by the taxpayer's marginal income tax rate. For example, a taxpayer with $20,000 of eligible state and local taxes and a top marginal tax rate of 35% would save $7,000 from the SALT deduction (i.e., $20,000*0.35). For taxpayers who would have claimed the standard deduction without access to the SALT deduction, it generates tax savings equal to the difference between their tax liability if they had claimed the standard deduction and their total tax liability with itemized deductions (inclusive of the SALT deduction). (Throughout this report, the tax savings attributable to the SALT deduction is also referred to as the benefit from the deduction.) The TCJA established a temporary SALT cap for tax years 2018 through 2025. The SALT cap is set at $10,000 for single taxpayers or married couples filing jointly and $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately. By limiting the SALT deduction available to certain taxpayers, the SALT cap decreases the tax savings associated with the deduction relative to prior law, thereby increasing federal revenues. The TCJA also changed a number of tax code features (e.g., standard deduction amounts, marginal tax rates) that indirectly affect SALT deduction eligibility and the value of the tax savings it generates. The TCJA roughly doubled the standard deduction and limited other itemized deductions. The TCJA also prohibited SALT deduction claims on taxes paid on foreign real property for tax years 2018 through 2025. The SALT cap, the increased value of the standard deduction, and other tax changes enacted by the TCJA have reduced the number of taxpayers claiming the SALT deduction and the total tax savings from those claims. Table 1 shows the most recent estimates of reductions in federal revenues attributable to the SALT deduction for FY2017, the last full year before enactment of P.L. 115-97 , and FY2019 through FY2023. Revenue losses from the SALT deduction in FY2017 ($100.9 billion) nearly equaled the total losses projected from FY2019 through FY2023 ($117.2 billion). The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) projects that 16.4 million taxpayers will claim a SALT deduction for tax year 2019, compared to 46.6 million taxpayers who the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reported claiming the deduction in 2017. Recent research has estimated the SALT cap's effect on SALT deduction claims independent of other tax changes enacted through the TCJA. A 2019 Treasury Inspector General report examined the SALT cap's hypothetical effect had it been imposed in tax year 2017, prior to the other TCJA changes taking effect. The report found that the cap would have reduced SALT deduction benefits for 10.9 million taxpayers (about 25% of all households claiming the deduction) and reduced deduction amounts by $323 billion, or just over half of the actual amounts deducted in that year. In June 2019, JCT estimated that holding all other portions of the tax code constant, repealing the SALT cap for tax year 2018 would decrease FY2019 federal revenues by $77.4 billion. The SALT deduction provides state and local governments with an increased ability to levy taxes by reducing the after-tax cost of state and local taxes to taxpayers. By limiting the deduction's benefits, the SALT cap increases the cost (or \"price\") of state and local taxes for affected taxpayers. For example, consider a taxpayer with itemized deductions, a 35% marginal tax rate, and $20,000 in eligible SALT payments. Without a SALT cap in place, the net price of those taxes for the taxpayer would be $13,000 (or $20,000*[1-0.35]), as the taxpayer can use all $20,000 of those tax payments to reduce federal tax liability. When a $10,000 SALT cap is imposed, the final price of those taxes rises to $16,500 (or $10,000 + [$10,000*(1-0.35)]). The basic economic law of demand\u00e2\u0080\u0094there is an inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded\u00e2\u0080\u0094suggests that by increasing the price of state and local taxes, a SALT cap would lead to a decline in demand for state and local government activity. The size of the decrease would be a function of the sensitivity of public desire for state and local services, paid for by taxes, to changes in the price of those services (i.e., the elasticity of demand). Research has found indications that state and local governments respond to federal tax changes with shifts in their own tax and spending practices. Response to the SALT cap could be a function of its salience , that is, the public awareness of its effect on tax liability. SALT cap salience may depend on awareness of the state and local taxes themselves, which can vary significantly across tax system features. Salience for taxpayers who take the standard deduction, but who would be better off itemizing deductions if not for the SALT cap, may be particularly low, as the SALT cap's effects may not be apparent in tax filing software. Taxpayers could also have difficulty differentiating SALT cap-related liability changes from other changes enacted through the TCJA. State and local governments are generally limited in their ability to respond to shifts in demand for government services with changes in fiscal outcomes (i.e., increased deficits or reduced surpluses). Unlike the federal government, which has no enforceable balanced-budget requirement, most state and local governments are statutorily required to balance operating revenues and operating expenses over a one-year or two-year period. Governments with a binding balanced-budget requirement would therefore need to match any reduction in SALT revenue resulting from the cap with a reduction in spending on services provided or increases in other revenue sources. This section explores features of localities and households that are likely to influence the distribution and intensity of SALT cap effects on tax liability. The recent enactment and implementation of the SALT cap means that tax return data on its impact by state, locality, and income level are currently unavailable. However, analyzing the SALT deduction's distribution prior to the cap's imposition can provide insight into its likely impact. The data indicate that the SALT cap's effects will vary significantly across state and local jurisdictions and household income. The SALT cap's effect is in part a function of state and local tax policies. For example, greater effective rates levied on taxes that qualify for the deduction (income taxes, general sales taxes, real and personal property taxes) would increase the amount of SALT-eligible tax payments and therefore increase the probability that a taxpayer will have SALT deductions that exceed the cap. State and local tax rates could thus affect both the number of taxpayers with higher tax liability from the SALT cap (sometimes referred to as SALT cap exposure) and the amount of those increases (sometimes referred to as the SALT cap burden). Differences in local incomes and price levels are another determinant of the SALT cap's effect. Wages and prices are the bases against which state and local governments levy SALT-eligible income, sales, and property taxes. Consider two households that are in separate localities and have different incomes but the same tax rates and the same purchasing power. In other words, adjusting for their local price levels, each household is able to purchase the same sets of goods and services. Although each household faces the same set of purchasing options on the public and private markets, the household facing higher price levels is more likely to have SALT payments in excess of the SALT cap. State and local governments raised a combined $1.30 trillion in individual income taxes, general sales taxes, and property taxes in 2017, an average of about $8,500 per federal income taxpayer. Those revenues are divided almost evenly between state governments ($667 billion in revenues), which collected the majority of the income and sales taxes, and local governments ($632 billion), which collected the majority of property taxes. There is considerable geographic variation in the rates at which taxes are levied and in the incomes and prices to which those taxes apply. Figure 1 shows effective state and local tax rates for all SALT-eligible taxes in each state, calculated as the percentage of total adjusted gross income paid in-state and local general sales taxes, individual income taxes, and property taxes. In 2017, New York (17.2% effective tax rate), Washington, DC (16.9%), Hawaii (16.1%), Maine (15.0%), and Nebraska (14.2%) had the highest combined effective state and local tax rates. Delaware (6.8%), Alaska (7.6%), Florida (7.7%), New Hampshire (8.3%) and Tennessee (8.4%) had the lowest combined tax rates. All else equal, states with higher SALT-eligible effective tax rates are likely to experience greater SALT cap effects on tax liability than states with lower rates. Figure 2 plots the average SALT deduction amount for each 2017 congressional district (districts are from the 115 th Congress). The districts with the 20 highest average SALT deductions are located in states with above-average effective tax rates in Figure 1 , including New York, California, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Nineteen of the districts with the 20 lowest average SALT deductions are located in Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Alabama, Nevada, Arizona, and Alaska, all states with below-average effective state and local tax rates. Figure 2 shows the potential significance of local tax and economic activity on the SALT cap's effects. Figure 3 adds a layer of analysis by plotting two variables on each congressional district: (1) average adjusted gross income (AGI) of taxpayers and (2) average effective SALT rates. Each district categorized as having low effective SALT rates in Figure 3 had an average AGI below $75,000, and 13 of these districts had average AGI below $50,000. Nineteen of the 20 districts with the highest effective SALT rates had an average AGI above $100,000, and four of the top five districts had an average AGI above $200,000. The distribution of SALT deductions across household income is discussed further in the next section. Figure 3 demonstrates the importance of considering both tax rates and the tax base when examining potential SALT cap effects. As with other tax deductions, SALT deduction benefits accrue more for higher-income taxpayers than lower-income taxpayers. Two factors explain this pattern: (1) higher incomes directly lead to more state and local income taxes and are correlated with higher sales and property tax payments stemming from greater consumption; and (2) taxpayers with higher incomes are subject to higher marginal tax rates, so each dollar deducted from tax liability results in greater tax savings. Table 2 shows the JCT projections of SALT benefits by income class in tax years 2017 (the last year before the TCJA took effect) and 2019. Taxpayers with more than $100,000 of AGI received the vast majority of SALT benefits in both 2017 (93%) and 2019 (89%). Taxpayers with income between $50,000 and $200,000 received a larger share of total benefits in 2019 (44%) than 2017 (29%), whereas the opposite trend occurs for taxpayers with more than $200,000 (declining from 71% to 56%). Taxpayers with less than $50,000 received relatively little benefit from the SALT deduction in both years. Data from Table 2 suggest that the SALT cap increased the federal tax burden of high-income taxpayers. This occurs because the SALT cap (1) reduced the number of taxpayers claiming the SALT deduction, who disproportionately fell in higher income classes; and (2) reduced SALT benefit levels of taxpayers with more than $10,000 in SALT payments, who were particularly likely to have high levels of income. JCT estimated that were the SALT cap eliminated in tax year 2019, more than half of the additional tax benefits would have been claimed by taxpayers with incomes exceeding $1 million. The SALT cap's total effect on the combined federal, state, and local tax burden across income levels will depend on the state and local government response to the SALT cap, which is uncertain. Figure 4 plots the percentage of all tax returns, the percentage of returns claiming SALT deductions, and the percentage of SALT deduction amounts claimed across income levels in tax year 2017, the latest year for which data are available. (The amount of SALT deduction claimed reflects the dollars deducted and not the tax savings associated with the deduction.) Tax returns with AGI exceeding $1 million represented less than 1% of all tax returns, but claimed over 25% of all SALT deduction amounts. Tax returns with over $100,000 in AGI claimed more than 78% of the SALT deduction amounts claimed, while returns with AGI below $50,000 claimed less than 10% of that total. The composition of state and local taxes also affects the SALT cap's ultimate effect on taxpayers within a local jurisdiction. Table 3 illustrates how SALT cap burden distribution can differ when the composition of state and local taxes changes while holding total tax revenue constant. In both jurisdictions, total tax revenues are $44,000. In Jurisdiction I, relatively high income tax rates generate higher income tax payments, and the SALT cap burden falls on Tax Units A and B, the taxpayers with higher incomes. In Jurisdiction II, property tax rates are higher than income tax rates, and the SALT cap burden instead falls on Tax Units A and C, the taxpayers with high property values. More of the state and local tax revenue in Jurisdiction II is above the SALT cap, meaning that taxpayers in Jurisdiction II are able to deduct less in SALT deductions on their federal income tax returns. This analysis highlights the importance of state and local tax structure in determining the SALT cap's effect on taxpayer liability even when holding the average level of taxes constant. The state and local response to the SALT cap's effect has varied across municipalities. Certain governments in states with relatively high mean SALT deduction values (see Figure 1 ) have either enacted legislation that would appear to make tax changes to reduce the SALT cap's effect on their taxpayers or taken legal action against the federal government. Recent federal and legal responses to some of these actions suggest these efforts will likely be unsuccessful. State and local governments with relatively lower levels of SALT cap exposure have taken little to no action. Following enactment of the TCJA, several state governments made changes to their tax codes with the potential to lower their residents' SALT cap exposure. Certain states enacted laws that provided taxpayers a credit against state taxes for charitable donations to state entities, which would then be eligible for the federal charitable deduction under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS has since issued a final ruling limiting the availability of Section 170 charitable deductions in such a way that would render the new charitable activity ineligible. A legislative proposal that would overturn IRS regulations, S.J.Res. 50 , was rejected by the Senate in October 2019. Some states have tried to use a \"pass-through work around\" to reduce the SALT cap's impact on some of their taxpayers with pass-through business income. Many types of businesses that do not pay corporate income taxes (including S corporations and partnerships) pass through income to their owners, who pay taxes on that income at the individual level. The SALT cap does not limit SALT deductions associated with the carrying on of a trade or business. Hence, taxpayers whose SALT tax payments are associated with pass-through business income may not be subject to the SALT cap in the same manner as other individual income tax payments. Certain state governments have adjusted for this activity by enacting laws that levy or raise taxes on the pass-through business entity itself that are offset (holding total tax rates constant) by tax reductions or tax credits applied to individual income liability for pass-through business members subject to the tax increase . The IRS has not issued guidance on the viability of such legislation or its effect on SALT cap exposure. Several states also took legal action related to the SALT cap following enactment of the TCJA, filing suit against the U.S. government in July 2018 and challenging the cap's constitutionality. A September 2019 federal district court ruling upheld the SALT cap's constitutionality, asserting that it did not unconstitutionally penalize certain jurisdictions. Legislation introduced in the 116 th Congress would modify the SALT cap, including proposals that would (1) repeal the SALT cap entirely; (2) increase the SALT cap's value for all taxpayers; (3) increase the SALT cap's value for some taxpayers; (4) make the SALT cap permanent; and (5) repeal IRS regulations affecting SALT cap liability. Table 4 displays legislation in the 116 th Congress that would directly modify the SALT cap.",
      "summary": "Taxpayers who elect to itemize their deductions may reduce their federal income tax liability by claiming a deduction for certain state and local taxes paid, often called the \"SALT deduction.\" The 2017 tax revision (commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, TCJA; P.L. 115-97 ) made a number of changes to the SALT deduction. Most notably, the TCJA established a limit, or \"SALT cap,\" on the amounts claimed as SALT deductions for tax years 2018 through 2025. The SALT cap is $10,000 for single taxpayers and married couples filing jointly and $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately. The changes enacted in the TCJA will considerably affect SALT deduction activity in the next several years. The increased value of the standard deduction (roughly doubling from its pre-TCJA value for tax years 2018 through 2025), along with the reduced availability of SALT and other itemized deductions, are projected to significantly reduce the number of SALT deduction claims made in those years. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) projected that repealing that SALT cap for tax year 2019 would increase federal revenues by $77.4 billion. The SALT deduction reduces the cost of state and local government taxes to taxpayers because a portion of the taxes deducted is effectively paid for by the federal government. By reducing the deduction's value, the SALT cap therefore increases the cost to the taxpayer of state and local taxes. That may affect state and local tax and spending behavior, as any reduction in state and local revenues from increased sensitivity to SALT-eligible tax rates must be offset by reductions in outlays or increases in other revenue to maintain budget outcomes. The SALT cap's effect on the SALT deduction's value is in part a function of state and local tax policies. Nationwide, there is considerable variation in both the combined level of income and sales taxes levied by states and the property taxes and other charges levied by local governments. Differences in incomes and price levels that serve as the base for those taxes are another source of disparity in SALT cap exposure. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data showed that in 2017, the average SALT deduction claimed in New York ($23,804) was more than four times the average in Alaska ($5,451). The SALT cap predominantly affects taxpayers with higher incomes. State and local tax payments tend to increase with income, both as a direct function of the income tax structure and because higher incomes lead to increased consumption and thus sales and property tax payments. Increased income, therefore, makes higher-income taxpayers more likely to make SALT-eligible tax payments in amounts exceeding the SALT cap value. The benefit of SALT deductions in terms of tax savings is also larger for taxpayers with higher incomes because a federal tax deduction's value is proportional to the taxpayer's marginal income tax rate. JCT projected that more than half of 2019 benefits for the SALT deduction will accrue to taxpayers with incomes exceeding $200,000. Several pieces of legislation introduced in the 116 th Congress would modify the SALT cap, including legislation that would (1) repeal the SALT cap entirely; (2) increase the SALT cap's value for all taxpayers; (3) increase the SALT cap's value for some taxpayers; (4) make the SALT cap permanent; and (5) repeal IRS regulations affecting SALT cap liability. Following enactment of the TCJA, several states proposed or passed legislation that provided possible avenues to reduce the SALT cap's effect on taxpayers without reducing their relevant state or local tax burdens. Subsequent guidance by the IRS, however, makes it unclear or unlikely that those laws will prevent taxpayers from experiencing the SALT cap's effects.",

      "document": "in patients with hf , increased raas contributes to the pathogenesis , and ace inhibitors reduce the activity of the raas by inhibiting the production of angiotensin ii . \n two benchmark randomized controlled trials , namely the cooperative north scandinavian enalapril survival study7 and the studies of left ventricular dysfunction treatment trial,8 demonstrated that ace inhibitors reduce mortality and improved new york heart association class , exercise capacity and cardiac function in patients with hf with reduced ef . \n subsequently , the assessment of treatment with lisinopril and survival study5 investigated whether ace inhibitors had favourable effects on the outcome of patients with hf with reduced ef in a dosedependent manner . in this trial , \n an ace inhibitor , lisinopril , at high dose ( 32.535  mg daily ) significantly decreased death or hospitalization for any cause by 12% ( p  =  0.002 ) compared with that at low dose ( 2.55  mg daily ) , but not significantly decreased death by 8% ( p  =  0.128 ) . \n show that benazepril at supramaximal dose results in prolonged survival by 41% compared with that at low dose [ 95% confidence interval ( ci ) 0.360.98 , p  =  0.042 ] . \n further research should reveal whether ace inhibitors at supramaximal dose reduce the mortality rate in patients with hf compared with those at high dose . \n common side effects of ace inhibitors are hyperkalaemia , hypotension , cough , and impaired renal function . according to the severity of these adverse events , \n it is crucial to manage when to stop uptitration , reduce dose , or discontinue treatment . \n five ace inhibitors , namely ramipril , enalapril , lisinopril , captopril , and trandolapril , are listed for the treatment of hf with reduced ef , and the starting dose and the target dose are also described in the current guidelines.3 however , it remains unclear which ace inhibitor should be administered or if there are differences between the drugs , because headtohead comparisons are still missing . \n angiotensin receptor blockers would be expected to exert beneficial effects on the treatment of hf through the stronger inhibition of angiotensin ii than ace inhibitors . \n the evaluation of losartan in the elderly study ii study9 showed that losartan was noninferior to captopril in reducing mortality in elderly patients with hf with reduced ef ( hazard ratio 1.13 , 95% ci 0.951.35 , p  =  0.16 ) , and the candesartan in heart failureassessment of reduction in mortality and morbidityalternative trial10 showed that candesartan reduces the risk of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for hf in patients intolerant of ace inhibitors compared to placebo ( hazard ratio 0.70 , 95% ci 0.600.81 , p  <  0.0001 ) . \n subsequently , the heart failure endpoint evaluation of angiotensin ii antagonist losartan study6 revealed that losartan at high dose ( 150  mg daily ) reduced death or hospitalization for hf in patients with hf with reduced ef , compared with losartan at low dose ( 50  mg daily ) ( hazard ratio 0.90 , 95% ci 0.820.99 ; p  =  0.027 ) , indicating the doserelated therapeutic effect of arbs on the outcome of hf as well as ace inhibitors . in the swedish heart failure registry,11 the use of losartan was associated with significant increase in mortality in patients with hf compared with that of candesartan ( hazard ratio 1.43 , 95% ci 1.231.65 , p  <  0.001 ) , suggesting the different clinical effects among arbs . \n common side effects of arbs are well known and include hyperkalaemia , hypotension , and impaired renal function , similar to ace inhibitors ; however , arbs are believed to be better tolerated than ace inhibitors . \n reports that 29 patients ( 29% ) at supramaximaldose benazepril withdrew from this study , as did 12 patients ( 12% ) at supramaximaldose valsartan . \n doserelated increase in the development of adverse events in patients receiving both benazepril and valsartan is observed , which is inconsistent with the findings of previous studies using very highdose arb.12 , 13 \n  in view of these findings , arbs are considered second choice in patients with hf with reduced ef who are not tolerated to ace inhibitors or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in the current guidelines . \n because of the different mechanism of action of ace inhibitors and arbs in blocking the raas , combination therapy of an ace inhibitor and an arb was thought to be attractive for the treatment of hf as well as the monotherapy with an arb . in the valsartan heart failure trial,14 the addition of valsartan to conventional therapy for hf resulted in a significant decrease in cardiovascular events compared to placebo ( relative risk 0.87 , 97.5% ci 0.770.97 , p  =  0.009 ) ; however , a post hoc analysis indicated increased mortality and complications in the subgroup taking an ace inhibitor , valsartan , and a betablocker . \n moreover , a recent metaanalysis15 suggested that combination therapy of an ace inhibitor with an arb should not be advocated in patients with hf , because the combination does not seem to reduce mortality or hospitalization and was associated with more adverse events . \n as described earlier , an ace inhibitor , lisinopril , or an arb , losartan , at high dose produced better clinical outcomes in patients with hf compared with each at low dose but did not decrease mortality significantly.5 , 6 on the other hand , he et al . \n reports that supramaximal dose of benazepril or valsartan improves not only cardiac function but also survival in patients with dcm compared with the low dose of each medication,16 which indicates that ace inhibitors or arbs at supramaximaldose might produce better outcomes in patients with ef compared with those at high dose ( target dose ) . \n these unique findings are derived from a singlecentre prospective , randomized , and controlled trial . \n the sample size is small , but the followup period is long enough to detect the statistical difference in the outcomes of hf among the treatment groups . they should be confirmed with doubleblind multicentre randomized controlled studies . \n recently , ivabradine17 and lcz696 , a combination of the new neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril ( ahu377 ) with valsartan,18 have attracted attention for the treatment of hf . \n if the efficacy and safety of supramaximaldose valsartan were well acknowledged in this field , it would be helpful to investigate the appropriate dose of lcz696 more precisely . \n ",

      "document": "the increase in bacterial antibiotic resistance is a serious problem , increasing both in severity and importance . \n therefore , it is necessary to find means of limiting or even preventing the transmission of pathogens within medical facilities . \n surfaces in patients surroundings , including the door knob or handle , are a relevant transmission route for viruses and microorganisms , , , . \n hospital staff , visitors , cleaning services and others are a potential source of contamination for door handles . in particular , the nursing staff  with a hand - disinfection rate of under 50% ,    can spread pathogens , as can other employees , 4.6% of whom have been found to be colonized with mrsa . \n one alternative to avoid this route of transmission is to equip doors with a foot - operated door opener rather than with a door handle . \n a device for opening the door with the foot was fitted flush into the door leaf . a pedal ( figure 1 ( fig . \n 1 ) ) is integrated into the device , which is built into the bottom of the door leaf . to open the door , \n this pedal is pulled out with the foot from the inside of the device , while the foot constantly remains on the surface of the pedal . \n after completely pulling the pedal out , the door can be pushed open or pulled open while keeping light pressure on the pedal with the foot . \n the surface design of the pedal provides the necessary grip of the shoe on the pedal during the movement to be executed . \n subsequently , the door will briefly remain in the open position before the door closer starts to pull the door back into its frame . \n using the foot pedal alone , this device makes it possible to open the door without manual operation . \n after opening of the door , there is ample time to pass through the open door . \n the foot - operated door opener is optionally equipped with a soft - closing mechanism . as a result , while opening the door with the foot door opener , the door latch ( figure 1 ( fig . \n 1 ) ) will be kept inside the door lock by a mechanism integrated into the foot door opener . only after complete closing of the door ( i.e. \n , the door is back in its frame ) is the door latch released by the mechanism : the door latch slowly and quietly returns to its normal position in the counterpart within the door frame . \n the function of the door handle and the door lock itself is not affected . in both cases , opening with the door handle or foot - operated door opener , the door latch is triggered , which means a change in the mechanics of the normal door handle with its lock is not necessary . \n only if the door lock itself is locked is it impossible to open the door with either the handle or   the foot door opener . equipped with the soft closing mechanism , the noise generated by the door latch hitting the door frame \n is completely prevented , and the noise generated by the door latch quickly snapping back into its counterpart in the door frame is almost imperceptible . the foot door opener makes the door handle   superfluous in most cases . \n in addition , the transport of items that must be carried with both hands , e.g. , trays , is facilitated . \n another means of opening doors without using the hands is provided by door handles designed to be operated with the forearm . however \n , this type of handle can still be operated by hand and is thus in danger of becoming contaminated . nevertheless , when used correctly , the forearm - operated door opener reduces the risk of cross - infection . \n where door handles are coated with oligodynamic effective metals such as silver and copper in nanocrystalline form , the antimicrobial action takes effect only many hours later , and a false sense of security is produced . \n based on unproven efficacy within a relevant exposure time , inactivation through protein loading , and the absence of evaluations on possible toxic risks , coating door handles with such compounds is not a reasonable alternative to the foot - operated door opener . if used correctly , the mechanical foot - operated door opener can completely avoid the transfer of pathogens . \n additional advantages include : no electrical energy is necessary for operationno follow - up costs arise , e.g. , from consumablesthe functionality of the existing door lock is not compromised , andnothing protrudes from the plane of the door leaf . \n no electrical energy is necessary for operation no follow -

Of 87 Republican freshmen, just nine have lost their bids for a second term at last count. There is a common perception that the freshman class was stocked with tea partyers, but just 19 of 87 GOP freshmen joined the Tea Party Caucus after the 2010 landslide. Two freshmen Democrats, Reps. Mark Critz of Pennsylvania and Kathy Hochul of western New York, also lost.\n\nOf the 60 members of the Tea Party Caucus, 46 have already clinched victory. Four others, including Bachmann and West, remain in races too close to call. Six Tea Party caucus members were defeated at the polls, plus another seven who retired, lost a primary or sought higher office. Both tea party candidates who ran for the Senate, Reps. Denny Rehberg of Montana and Todd Akin of Missouri lost, while Rep. Mike Pence won his bid for governor of Indiana.\n\nBlue Dog Democrats also saw their numbers shrink from 24 to 15, including six members who retired, sought higher office, or were defeated in primaries earlier this year. Reps. Ben Chandler, Larry Kissell, and Leonard Boswell all lost Tuesday.\n\nOne Blue Dog, Rep. Jim Matheson of Utah, fended off an intense challenge from Mia Love, a small-town mayor who was running to become the first black woman Republican elected to Congress. With 100 percent of the precincts reporting, Matheson defeated Love by nearly 3,000 votes. She issued a statement offering her congratulations to Matheson early Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Jim on a hard fought victory,\u201d Love said. \u201cIt was a close race, but ultimately the voters of Utah have spoken.\u201d",
      "summary": "Some of the Republican Party\u2018s most controversial House members are clinging to narrow leads in races where only a few votes are left to count. Rep. Michele Bachmann, the chairwoman of the Tea Party Caucus, led by almost 2,300 votes with 84 percent of precincts reporting as of early this morning. That race is still too close to call and shifted back and forth all night long. Rep. Allen West of Florida, one of the most outspoken Republicans in the House of Representatives, trailed Patrick Murphy by fewer than 3,000 votes with all precincts reporting. The race is still too\u2026",

      "document": "myoepithelioma is a benign tumor that can originate from any secretory system throughout the body . in the salivary gland , myoepithelioma is rare , accounting for 1% of all salivary gland tumors . \n although myoepithelioma of the salivary gland originates most frequently in the parotid gland , myoepithelioma of the accessory parotid gland ( apg ) is extremely rare , and to date , only 5 cases have been reported in the english literature [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] . \n because the clinicopathological and mri findings of myoepithelioma of the apg have not yet been fully described , and given the rarity of this condition , we hereby describe the clinicopathological and mri findings of an epithelioid myoepithelioma of the apg that was treated in our hospital . \n a 31-year - old woman presented with a 5-year history of a slowly enlarging left mid - cheek mass in the pre - parotid region . upon examination , a mobile non - tender and smooth - surfaced mass measuring 20 mm in the greatest dimension was noted in the left pre - parotid region . \n an unenhanced ct of the neck confirmed a well - circumscribed and homogenous mass measuring 18  10 mm and located anterior to the left main parotid gland and on the surface of the masseter muscle . \n this lobulated mass demonstrated isointensity and hyperintensity relative to the muscle on t1- and t2-weighted mri images ( wis ) , respectively , and homogeneous enhancement on contrast - enhanced t1-wis ( fig . \n c ) . a time - signal intensity curve ( tic ) generated from a dynamic mri study revealed a gradual enhancement pattern ( fig . 1d ) . \n on t2-wis , the mass periphery was surrounded by hypointensity that was suggestive of a fibrous capsule . \n the tumor was most likely considered a pleomorphic adenoma ( pa ) , given the clinical presentation and mri findings . \n the mass and the surrounding salivary tissue were completely separated from the main parotid gland and connected to the parotid duct via a ductule . \n all facial nerve branches and the parotid duct were successfully preserved , and postoperative complications such as facial paralysis and salivary fistula were not observed . grossly , the tumor was well encapsulated , solid , and lobular ( fig . \n microscopically , the tumor primarily comprised cells with round nuclei and a few cells with oval and slightly spindle - shaped nuclei . \n the neoplastic cells were arranged in an epithelial and mostly lattice - like structure with hyalinous and mucinous stroma . \n 2c ) , cam5.2 ( cytokeratin stain ) , s-100 protein , smooth muscle actin ( sma ) , cytokeratin14 , and ae1/ae3 ( pan - keratin stain ) , as well as negativity for carcinoembryonic antigen . based on these results , the final histopathological diagnosis of the tumor was epithelioid myoepithelioma . \n pa is reportedly the most common subtype of benign apg tumors ; in contrast , myoepithelioma represents an extremely rare apg tumor pathology . \n only 5 cases of myoepithelioma of the apg have been reported in the english literature . \n kawashima et al .   reported a case in a 34-year - old woman , isogai et al . \n reported a case of plasmacytoid myoepithelioma of the apg in a 47-year - old woman , and sun et al .   reported a case in a 41-year - old man and one in a 22-year - old woman ; \n recently , xie et al .   described the fifth case in a 65-year - old man who was treated via an endoscopic approach . \n there have been only a few reports on the imaging findings of myoepithelioma of the parotid gland . according to wang et al . \n , myoepithelioma of the parotid gland is characterized by a well - defined and smooth or lobulated mass with homogeneous or inhomogeneous enhancement on the ct . although mri is a widely used modality for evaluating parotid gland tumors because it provides a greater amount of morphological information than ct does , the mri features of myoepithelioma of the apg have not been previously described . \n the typical mri findings of pa , in contrast , have been well described to include a lobulated or oval - shaped well - defined encapsulated mass , a mass with a hypointensity on t1-wis and hyperintensity surrounded by a hypointense capsule on t2-wis   as well as a gradual tic enhancement pattern in dynamic mri studies . in the present case , \n the myoepithelioma of the apg was isointense relative to the muscle on t1-wis , hyperintense relative to the muscle on t2-wis , and well enhanced on contrast - enhanced t1-wis . \n additionally , a tic generated from a gadolinium - enhanced dynamic mri study displayed a gradual enhancement pattern . \n we preoperatively suspected the mass to be pa because the mri findings were completely consistent with those of pa . \n as the name indicates , myoepithelioma comprises neoplastic cells exhibiting myoepithelial differentiation ; these cells display various morphologic patterns such as spindle , plasmacytoid , epithelioid , and clear types . because of this morphologic diversity \n , it is usually difficult to definitively diagnose myoepithelioma by fnac before surgery , although das et al . \n reported a case of a successful preoperative parotid myoepithelioma diagnosis via a cytological examination and immunohistochemistry . \n the main differential diagnoses of myoepithelioma include pa , adenoid cystic carcinoma , other salivary tumors without obvious ductal differentiation , and mesenchymal tumors . \n in particular , we should always consider various low - grade malignant tumors when interpreting the fnac results from salivary tumors . \n a histopathological examination of the resected specimen can yield a definitive diagnosis of myoepithelioma , and immunohistochemical staining plays an important role in the detection of neoplastic myoepithelial cells . \n such cells are typically positive for cytokeratin , vimentin , s-100 protein , calponin , sma , and glial fibrillary acidic protein , but negative for carcinoembryonic antigen . in our case , \n the histopathological findings of an epithelial and lattice - like arrangement of neoplastic cells with hyalinous and mucinous stroma were also characteristic components of pa . \n however , neither cartilaginous myxoid stroma nor a glandular structure was found in our case , and the tumor was entirely encapsulated by connective tissue . \n additionally , positive immunohistochemical staining of the neoplastic cells for cam5.2 , cytokeratin14 , ae1/ae3 , sma , and calponin indicated that these neoplastic cells possessed both epithelial and myoepithelial characters . \n complete resection along with the surrounding salivary tissue is recommended for myoepithelioma management in order to avoid tumor recurrence . in conclusion , a mid - cheek mass could easily be suspected as an apg tumor according to the clinical presentation and imaging findings . \n however , because myoepithelioma is an extremely rare apg tumor subtype and the imaging findings of myoepithelioma resemble those of pa , which is the most common benign apg tumor subtype , we believe that it is nearly impossible to preoperatively distinguish myoepithelioma of the apg from pa of the apg or low - grade malignant tumors , even by using fnac , given that kawashima et al .   also misdiagnosed a myoepithelioma of the apg as a suspected adenoid cystic carcinoma ( after fnac ) . \n ",
      "summary": "tumors of the accessory parotid gland ( apg ) are rare , and pleomorphic adenoma ( pa ) is the most common benign apg tumor subtype . \n myoepithelioma of the apg is much rarer than pa , and to date , only 5 cases have been sporadically reported in the english literature . \n we describe the clinicopathological and mri findings of an epithelioid myoepithelioma of the apg that was treated in our hospital . \n the patient 's only clinical symptom was a slow - growing and painless mid - cheek mass . \n the tumor was suspected to be pa before surgery based on the following mri findings : ( 1 ) a well - circumscribed and lobulated contour , ( 2 ) isointensity and hyperintensity relative to the muscle on t1- and t2-weighted images ( wis ) , respectively , ( 3 ) good enhancement on contrast - enhanced t1-wis , ( 4 ) peripheral hypointensity on t2-wis , and ( 5 ) a gradual time - signal intensity curve enhancement pattern on gadolinium - enhanced dynamic mri . \n the tumor was completely resected via a standard parotidectomy approach , and the postoperative pathological examination of the tumor , including immunohistochemistry , confirmed the diagnosis of epithelioid myoepithelioma . as it is hardly possible to distinguish myoepithelioma from pa and low - grade malignant tumors preoperatively , \n a pathological examination using frozen sections is helpful for surgical strategy - related decisions .",

      "document": "this has been attributed to procedure time , cost , and the known risks , which include arterial puncture , pneumothorax , and infection . \n numerous studies done in the last few years have paid attention to peripheral venous pressure ( pvp ) and more specifically its pressure waveform . \n although controversy still exists concerning the role of peripheral veins and their contribution to the central volume in face of blood loss , many studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s have shown a consistent correlation between central venous pressure ( cvp ) and pvp . \n this implies that in emergency conditions and situations where anatomical sites are inaccessible for central venous catheterization as seen in burns patients , the estimation of cvp is possible via measurement of peripheral intravenous ( iv ) catheter . \n hemodynamic monitoring has been shown to provide valuable additional information if burn resuscitation is not proceeding as planned or volume therapy guided by the typical vital signs is not attaining the desired effect . \n the goal of this study was to determine a reliable association between changes in cvp and pvp in patients with burns and to assess the long - term correlation in varied hemodynamic status during the first 10 h. \n after obtaining institutional ethical committee approval and informed consent from each patient , 30 consecutive patients admitted to our burns intensive care unit ( bicu ) from june to august 2014 were included in our study . \n the exclusion criteria were patients on the mechanical ventilator and untimely death during the study period . \n the sample size was decided after doing a pilot study for a month in our bicu and based on power of analysis . \n central venous pressure access was obtained using a 7 french double - lumen , arrow international catheter placed via the left or right internal jugular or subclavian vein . \n tip of central venous catheter was inserted at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium confirmed by chest x - ray . \n the peripheral measurement of cvp was obtained from a peripheral iv site ( dorsum of the hand , forearm or antecubital region ) using a standard iv catheter ( 18 , 20 or 22 gauges ) . \n cvp was measured from both the central venous catheter and the peripheral iv catheters using philips and spacelab monitors equipped with invasive blood pressure monitoring transducers , which were zeroed at the phlebostatic axis . \n simultaneous measurements of cvp from central and peripheral venous catheters were made hourly for 10 consecutive hours . \n age , weight , height , site of cvp and pvp and peripheral iv catheter size for each patient were recorded . \n the predictability of cvp by pvp was examined using linear regression analysis at a p  0.05 . \n among the 30 patients in this study , there were 20 females and 10 males . \n the age range was from 18 to 65 years , and their weight ranged from 45 to 60 kg . \n the predictability of cvp by pvp was tested by applying the linear regression which is shown in figure 1 . \n this regression formula shows a reliable and significant association between cvp and pvp ( p < 0.001 ) . the overall mean difference between cvp and pvp was 1.628  0.84 mmhg . the mean difference between cvp and pvp in each hour \n we used the bland - altman diagram for estimation of agreement between cvp and pvp during the 10 h period . \n this showed a perfect agreement ( difference of  1.2 with an sd of + 1.96 ) as seen in figure 3 . \n the predictability of central venous pressure by measuring peripheral venous pressure tested by applying linear regression the hourly mean difference between central venous pressure and peripheral venous pressure agreement between central venous pressure and peripheral venous pressure during the 10 h period using bland \n the present study demonstrated reliable agreement between cvp and pvp over a 10 h period , suggesting that pvp monitoring can be used as a simple , cost - effective and less invasive substitute for cvp monitoring in patients admitted to the bicu . \n previous studies comparing cvp measured from central and peripheral access have shown a consistent correlation , but most of these studies were done in surgical patients , and we could not find any similar study in burns patients despite extensive literature search . \n cvp monitoring in the critically ill patients is usually performed by catheterization of either the subclavian or internal jugular veins . in burns \n patients , the site for catheterization of the central veins maybe inaccessible and in such patients monitoring the cvp via a peripheral vein is definitely an attractive option . \n the results of our study show that we can estimate cvp through simultaneous measurement of pvp and the difference between cvp and pvp measurements remain almost in a constant range over a period of time . \n hence , evaluation of hemodynamic changes occurring with dehydration or volume overload can be made by measuring pvp . \n , showed that pvp measured from a peripheral iv catheter in infants and children with congenital heart disease was an accurate estimation of cvp and its changes had good concordance with cvp over a long period of time . \n , however , reported that pvp measurement in critically ill patients did not give an accurate estimate of absolute value of cvp . \n tugrul et al . , also reported that pvp showed strong correlation with cvp and mean difference between pvp and cvp was 2 + 1.8 mmhg , but the upper limit of agreement of pvp - cvp ( 5.6 mmhg ) indicated the difference between two pressures might reach a clinically unacceptable value . \n however , in our study , the overall mean difference between cvp and pvp was 1.628  0.84 mmhg and the upper limit of agreement correlated to the clinically acceptable limits and were comparable with data described in other studies . \n , found the mean difference between pvp and cvp to be 1.6 mmhg in all intraoperative patients and 2.2 mmhg in the postoperative period . \n hoftman et al . , showed that pvp correlated with cvp even under adverse hemodynamic conditions in patients undergoing liver transplantation . \n studies have also shown that neither the peripheral iv catheter size nor the site of catheter placement interfered with the agreement of pvp and cvp . in our study , we used three different sites in the upper limb and three sizes of the peripheral catheter but did not find any statistically significant variations in the agreement of pvp and cvp values . \n although cvp waveforms characteristically showed a - waves , c - waves , and v - waves , pvp waveforms appeared as a more dampened sinusoidal pattern . \n we also noticed that the pvp tracing had more typical cvp waveforms when the peripheral catheter diameter was of a larger gauge and when the site was antecubital but since our subgroup sample size were small , we could not stratify this . \n although by placing the peripheral iv catheter more distally and decreasing its diameter increased the pvp - cvp gradient , these failed to reach statistical significance in the study done by tugrul et al . \n several studies have also demonstrated that the difference between cvp and pvp varies with the value of cvp . in nine patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation , \n hoftman et al . , reported a weaker correlation between pvp and cvp at lower cvp values . \n another study by cave and harvey showed that when cvp increased , the difference between pvp and cvp tended to decrease . \n the number of patients was too small for subgroup analysis with regard to the percentage of burns and to the site and size of peripheral catheters affecting the pvp - cvp gradient . \n we also did not have a protocol for fluid management and its effect on our data . \n hence , the trends in pvp may be useful as an alternative for hemodynamic monitoring in the bicu during emergencies , in situations where central venous site is inaccessible and also to avoid the complications of central venous catheterization in critically ill burns patients . \n further studies are needed to determine the clinical usefulness of pvp as a trend monitor for evaluating the intravascular volume in this patient population .",
      "summary": "background : optimizing cardiovascular function to ensure adequate tissue oxygen delivery is a key objective in the care of critically ill patients with burns . \n hemodynamic monitoring may be necessary to optimize resuscitation in serious burn patients with reasonable safety . \n invasive central venous pressure ( cvp ) monitoring has become the corner stone of hemodynamic monitoring in patients with burns but is associated with inherent risks and technical difficulties . \n previous studies on perioperative patients have shown that measurement of peripheral venous pressure ( pvp ) is a less invasive and cost - effective procedure and can reliably predict cvp.objective:the aim of the present prospective clinical study was to determine whether a reliable association exists between changes in cvp and pvp over a long period in patients admitted to the burns intensive care unit ( bicu).subjects and methods : the cvp and pvp were measured simultaneously hourly in 30 burns patients in the bicu up to 10 consecutive hours . \n the predictability of cvp by monitoring pvp was tested by applying the linear regression formula and also using the bland \n altman plots of repeated measures to evaluate the agreement between cvp and pvp.results:the regression formula revealed a reliable and significant association between cvp and pvp . \n the overall mean difference between cvp and pvp was 1.628  0.84 mmhg ( p < 0.001 ) . \n the bland \n altman diagram also showed a perfect agreement between the two pressures throughout the 10 h period.conclusion:peripheral venous pressure measured from a peripheral intravenous catheter in burns patients is a reliable estimation of cvp , and its changes have good concordance with cvp over a long period of time .",

More than 5,000 of their photos have been uploaded to a nifty interactive map that allows you to select exact locales and view firsthand the state of the beaches -- or at least, the state of the beaches as recorded during Saturday's event.\n\nThe massive public relations effort was orchestrated by Visit Florida, the state's tourism marketing organization. It comes at the start of the winter tourist season when officials are hoping to quell any doubts that the beaches suffered no lingering effects from the spill.\n\nAs an added incentive to draw viewers to the site, Visit Florida is sponsoring a sweepstakes with chances to win a Florida vacation, a Mazda Miata and a $5,000 gift card. Vote for your favorite mile of beach to enter the contest.\n\nPosted Nov 8 2010 6:00AM",

up , for which repeat vertebroplasty was performed . \n our selected patients did not complain of recurrent severe pain and did not undergo repeat vertebroplasty . in that cases , we defined recollapse or gradual vertebral height decrease in our study . \n chicago , il , usa ) . the chi - square test ( pearson ) was used to compare the groups . \n the average follow - up period was 16.5 months ( range , 13 - 29 months ) . \n the fractured vertebrae , included 1 at t11 , 14 at t12 , 20 at l1 , and 9 at l2 ( table 1 ) . \n height decrease of augmented vertebrae occurred in 10 of 26 men ( 38.5% ) and 12 of 18 women ( 66.7% ) . \n the height decrease was more common in women , but the difference was not statistically significant ( p=0.066 ) . \n fourteen were in a group aged less than 75 years , and 30 were aged 75 years or over ( average age , 76.1 years ) . \n they height decrease of augmented vertebrae occurred at the same rate in the two groups ( 50.0% ) . \n we defined severe osteoporosis as a t -

up with statistical significance ( table 2 ) . \n vertebral body height often increases during vertebroplasty , although the clinical significance of restoring height is unknown.7 ) kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty showed similar reduction in pain and disability , with similar safety and complication rates.4 ) vertebroplasty was not associated with increased refracture rates in different vertebrae.2123 ) however , other report showed refracture of different vertebrae in the vertebroplasty group occurred much sooner than that in a conservative treatment group.21 ) recollapse of augmented vertebrae is not relatively common . in our study , \n vertebral body height gradually decreased during the follow - up period in about half of the patients , without reappearance of severe back pain . \n air clefts and greater height restoration of fractured vertebrae were risk factors for recollapse.610 ) air clefts within the vertebrae were also prone to vertebral height decrease in our study . \n non - cemented - endplate - contact was another important predisposing factor for recollapse.10 ) preoperative kyphotic change also influenced recollapse of cemented vertebrae.8 ) cement augmentation restores the strength of treated vertebrae , but leads to an increased endplate bulge and altered load transfer in adjacent vertebrae.16 ) cemented vertebrae had a lower elastic modulus , but there was no significant effect on the frequency or severity of an induced fracture within the vertebrae.15 ) pneumaticos et al.18 ) reported that there is no difference in the compressive load of failure between augmented and non - augmented fractured vertebrae . \n these mechanisms may induce recollapse of augmented vertebrae as well as non - augmented fractured vertebrae . \n recollapse was more common with use of calcium phosphate.17 ) the mechanism of recollapse after vertebroplasty may be thermal necrosis19 ) and mismatch of elastic modulus , stiffness , and strength at the cement - bone interface.11 ) the optimal volume of cement to inject into fractured vertebrae remains controversial . \n vertebral augmentation with appropriate amounts of bone cement does not lead to stress peaks under the endplate.1 ) bone cement increases subsidence in the posterior regions of the treated endplate and the anterior region of the superior caudal endplate.14 ) greater height restoration and solid lump filling cement are risk factors for refracture of cemented vertebrae.313 ) greater volume of injected cement contributed to frequent subsequent fracture.12 ) cement volume was related to recollapse of fractured vertebrae as well as subsequent fracture.9 ) but , other studies showed that there was no correlation between injected cement volume and subsequent fracture.520 ) our study suggested that more than 4 cc of injected cement may induce a gradual vertebral height decrease after vertebroplasty . \n larger cement volume may induce more thermal necrosis and mismatch at cement - bone interface . \n a limitation of our study is that follow - up periods were relatively short and did not define the relationship between gradual vertebral height decrease and the clinical significance . \n so , further studies will be needed about clinical significance of gradual vertebral height decrease . \n more than 4 cc of injected cement and air cleft within the fractured vertebrae on admission induced gradual height decrease of augmented vertebrae . thus , longer \n follow -

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for \n        regulating civil aviation in the United States.\n            (2) Each State is responsible for the regulation of public \n        health planning and protection, patient safety and protection, \n        emergency medical services, the quality and coordination of \n        medical care, and the practice of medicine within its \n        jurisdiction.\n            (3) Helicopter medical services are an essential component \n        of the health care delivery and emergency medical services \n        system in each State and are integral to each State's \n        management of public health planning and protection, patient \n        safety and protection, emergency medical services, the quality \n        and coordination of medical care, and the practice of medicine \n        within the State's jurisdiction.\n            (4) Existing or future regulation of helicopter medical \n        services by the several States is in the public interest.\n            (5) Helicopter medical services represent a unique and \n        discrete area of air transportation because those services \n        present issues involving the adequacy and availability of \n        medical services to patients.\n            (6) Court rulings and statutory interpretations issued by \n        the Secretary of Transportation have imposed limitations on, \n        impeded, or prevented, the ability of States to effectively \n        regulate helicopter medical services in a manner similar to the \n        regulation of other health care services by the States.\n            (7) Those rulings and interpretations have concluded that \n        certain State actions related to public health planning and \n        protection, patient safety and protection, emergency medical \n        services, the quality and coordination of medical care, and the \n        practice of medicine, and related aspects of helicopter medical \n        services, are preempted by Federal law, either pursuant to the \n        preemption provisions of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 \n        (Public Law 95-504; 92 Stat. 1705) or through the application \n        of the ``field occupation'' preemption doctrine.\n            (8) The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 did not \n        contemplate helicopter medical services, and the use of the Act \n        to strike down intrastate health-related regulations overseeing \n        the provision of helicopter medical services that would \n        otherwise be permissible with respect to any other segment of \n        the health care industry is not in the public interest.\n            (9) At the same time, it is also important to ensure that \n        the Federal Aviation Administration's plenary and exclusive \n        jurisdiction over matters of aviation safety is not infringed \n        by any State. Accordingly, any State health-related regulation \n        of helicopter medical services must be harmonized and shall not \n        be inconsistent with Federal regulation of aviation safety \n        because the safe operation of the helicopter medical services \n        flight is of paramount importance.\n            (10) Accordingly, there is a need for clarification of \n        existing Federal law so that States may regulate helicopter \n        medical services with respect to public health planning and \n        protection, patient safety and protection, emergency medical \n        services, the quality and coordination of medical care, and the \n        practice of medicine without infringing on the Federal \n        government's plenary power to regulate aviation safety.\n\nSEC. 3.

p=0.38 ) , rr ( up = 3817 breathsmin , easy = 347 breathsmin , down = 3914 breathsmin ; p=0.45 ) or mrr ( up = 5417 breathsmin , easy = 6425 breathsmin , down = 6420 breathsmin ; p=0.31 ) . \n significant icc was observed for dbp ( r = 0.80 , p = 0.02 ) , rr ( r = 0.98 , p = 0.01 ) , sc ( r = 0.97 , p = 0.01 ) , ca ( r = 0.97 , p = 0.01 ) and rpe ( r = 0.94 , p = 0.01 ) . \n the icc for sbp ( r = 0.65 , p = 0.07 ) , hr ( r = 0.73 , p = 0.14 ) , mhr ( r = 0.65 , p = 0.91 ) , ee ( r = 0.53 , p = 0.25 ) , and maximal rr ( r = 0.68 , p = 0.09 ) were not significant . \n ratings of perceived exertion were not significantly correlated with sbp , average hr , or mhr during any of the hiking stages ( see table 1 ) . \n furthermore , there was no significant correlation between rr and ca in any of the hiking stages ( easy trail r = 0.19 , p = 0.49 ; strenuous uphill r = 0.52 , p = 0.16 ; strenuous downhill r = 0.25 , p = 0.49 ) . \n the primary purpose of this investigation was to pilot test the hxs while obtaining physiological measurements in an outdoor trail hiking setting . \n we hypothesized this technology would allow us to record measures that provided face validity . while measurements of hr and ee demonstrated expected values , it was not the case for mhr , rr , or mrr . additionally , while hxs measurements of rr , sc , and ca were found to be reliable , the measurements of hr , mhr , ee and mrr returned nonsignificant intraclass correlation coefficients . based on the physiological responses that we reported in our previous investigation ( 2 ) , we expected to observe a general increase during strenuous uphill hiking when compared with both the easy - rated trail and downhill portion of the strenuous trail . \n while we did observe this phenomenon for hr and ee ( see figures 1 and 2 ) , it was not consistent for mhr , rr , or mrr . \n the similar response in these variables to the different trail conditions may be due to the subjects self - selecting a slower pace for the strenuous uphill hike . \n evidence for this is suggested by the lower cadence for the uphill hike ( fig . \n 4 ) coupled with a significantly greater rpe . additionally , while not significant , there was a trend for rpe obtained during the uphill strenuous portion of the hike to be correlated with maximal heart rate ( p=0.051 ) . \n we have also observed that the hxs occasionally returned spurious values which could account for the results obtained . \n this should be taken into account for investigators wishing to utilize hxs in the field . while we acknowledge that a great number of subjects are necessary to determine reliability measures for the hxs , the poor iccs in the current investigation are a concern \n this is another factor that should be taken into consideration for researchers using this technology to obtain physiological measures in an outdoor field setting . \n ( 4 ) will be necessary to confirm that the hxs technology is valid and reliable in both laboratory and field - based settings . \n the results of this study indicate that hxs technology may be utilized to provide select physiological data in an applied setting . \n , hr did not register in 5 out of 10 subjects on the easy trail , and 8 out of 10 participants during the strenuous hike . \n due to the nature of field testing , we were not cognizant of this fact until we attempted to download the data at a later time \n . additionally , estimated ee values for the hexoskin appears to be linked to hr intensity . \n while further testing is necessary to determine the validity of this algorithm , the returned ee will not be accurate in cases where hr does not register on the hxs device . \n this study demonstrated there may be issues concerning the hxs s ability to measure and record data in a real - life setting . \n this product should first be validated against established laboratory and field standards in order to confirm the manufacturer s claims that the hxs is indeed a useful tool for  physical training , sleep , and personal daily activities .  in conclusion , we recommend that validity and reliability be established before hxs are utilized for research purposes in a field - based environment .",

      "summary": "American Livestock Protection and Ranching Opportunity Act of 2014 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: the majority of consumers in the United States want to know where animals used to produce the meat eaten are born, raised, and slaughtered; country-of-origin labeling provides information that consumers have a right to know; and country-of-origin labeling facilitates supply chain information critical for food safety. Amends the Animal Health Protection Act to prohibit the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) from allowing or advancing regulations that allow the importation of fresh meat and meat products from a country until the Secretary certifies to Congress that a country is free of foot-and-mouth disease without vaccination. Amends the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 to establish a USDA livestock disease initiative to provide competitive grants for research and development related to surveillance methods, vaccines, vaccination delivery systems, or diagnostic tests for diseases in domestic livestock that present a potential concern to public health and safety. Makes federal agencies, national laboratories, institutions of higher education, research institutions, and state agricultural experiment stations eligible for grants.  Amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to provide eligible livestock producers with assistance for losses due to brucellosis and to alter the payment rates USDA uses to provide agricultural disaster assistance under the Livestock Indemnity Program and the Livestock Forage Disaster Program.

      "summary": "Opioid Addiction Treatment Modernization Act  This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to require a practitioner who administers or dispenses narcotic drugs for maintenance or detoxification treatment in an opioid treatment program to complete training every two years.   The legislation revises the waiver requirements for a physician who wants to administer, dispense, or prescribe narcotic drugs for maintenance or detoxification treatment in an office-based opioid treatment program. Currently, such physician must notify the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and certify that he or she is a qualifying physician, has the capacity to refer patients for appropriate counseling and ancillary services, and will comply with a patient limit. This bill requires a physician to also certify that he or she maintains a diversion control plan and has the capacity to provide directly or by referral all drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of opioid addiction.   The bill modifies the definition of a \"qualifying physician.\" Currently, a qualifying physician must be licensed in a state and have expertise (such as relevant certification, training, or experience). This legislation requires a qualifying physician to also complete training every two years and obtain written consent from each patient regarding available treatment options.&nbsp;   It permits HHS or the Department of Justice to inspect registered practitioners who dispense narcotics to ensure compliance with the requirements of this Act.  All practitioners who are permitted to dispense narcotic drugs to individuals for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment must submit to HHS a certification of compliance with the requirements of this Act.  The Government Accountability Office must review opioid addition treatment services in the United States and report findings to Congress every five years. ",

      "document": "hemorrhage after percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) is a significant complication that occurs in a small percentage of cases . \n however , arterial injuries sometimes require transarterial embolization to control the refractory bleeding . in patient presenting with refractory bleeding , \n pseudoaneurysm formation is the most common cause with a reported incidence of 0.6 - 1% . \n we report a case of early erosion of an embolization coil from the renal vasculature into the urinary collecting system causing urinary tract obstruction and urosepsis . \n a 23-year - old male underwent left urs and pcnl for a left upper ureteric calculus and a 2.5-cm lower pole renal calculus in a community hospital in december , 2010 . \n one week after nephrostomy tube removal , the patient experienced gross hematuria with clot retention . \n the patient underwent endoscopic bladder clot evacuation and dj stent removal in the same hospital . \n two weeks later , again he developed gross hematuria with fever and a significant decrease in hematocrit . \n after resuscitation the patient was referred to our centre . on angiography , there was a pseudoaneurysm in the lower segmental renal artery . \n after 3 months of embolization , the patient presented with high - grade fever , left flank pain and burning micturiton . on x - ray kub 2 coils were seen in left renal area , whereas 1 coil was seen in l3 transverse process area . \n axial noncontrast and contrast - enhanced ct images showed left hydronephrosis with dilated upper ureter and an embolization coil in the upper ureter [ figure 1 ] . \n x ray kub shows 2 coils in left renal area , 1 coil in l3 transverse process area . \n ct urogram shows left hydronephrosis with dilated upper ureter and 2 coils in left kidney & 1 coil in upper ureter \n in 1975 , angioembolization for renal pseudoaneurysm was reported in a human patient when an autologous blood clot was used to embolize a bleeding pseudoaneurysm as a temporary measure before nephrectomy . \n we found only three case reports in which embolization coil migrated to the collecting system.[810 ] in all these case reports the coil eroded after 1 year following embolization . \n all the three patients presented with hematuria and renal colic . in our case , patient presented early ( 3 months ) with complaints of renal colic and persistent fever after coil embolization . hypothetically three mechanisms of coil erosion have been proposed . \n first , the diameter of arteriocaliceal communication might be larger than the embolization coil , and the coil gets extruded through the communication soon after placement . \n second , the arteriocaliceal communication could get dilated over time because of inflammation due to infection or the constant irritation from the indwelling coil itself , leading to eventual erosion into the collecting system . \n finally , rupture of the weakened wall of a pseudoaneurysm exposed to high arterial pressure may lead to erosion . according to the first hypothesis , \n if the arteriocaliceal communication was larger than the embolization coil than all three coils would have extruded through the communication and gross hematuria would have reappeared . \n the third mechanism would have lead to massive hematuria in addition to the coil migration . in this case \n the patient presented with high - grade fever and left flank pain but not hematuria . \n therefore in this case the second mechanism seems to be the most likely cause of erosion of the embolization coil . \n one of the important but rare causes of urinary tract obstruction is the migration of embolization coil into urinary collecting system .",
      "summary": "refractory bleeding following percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) is mainly due to formation of pseudoaneurysm . \n transarterial embolization is required to control the bleeding in such cases . \n we report a case of post - pcnl hematuria in whom angioembolization was done . \n an early erosion of the embolization coil from the renal vasculature into the urinary collecting system occurred , causing urinary tract obstruction and urinary tract infection ( uti ) . \n the coil was retrieved ureteroscopically after control of uti with antibiotics . \n migration of embolization coil into urinary collecting system is a rare but important cause of urinary tract obstruction . \n the treating physician as well as the patient should be aware of this complication .",
