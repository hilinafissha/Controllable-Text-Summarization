It was generating power at low levels, the utility said.\n\nThe plant was put back in service last weekend for the first time since Oct. 17, when the utility discovered a water leak in the reactor containment building. It was shut down again yesterday morning after operators noticed that oil in the non-nuclear turbine system had overheated. The nuclear fission in the reactor continued, but the turbines were disengaged while the utility corrected a restriction in the oil flow.\n\nA utility spokesman, Pat Richardi, said that the plant went back in service at 2:45 P.M. today, but that the 865-megawatt plant was producing only 100 megawatts of electricity. She said the utility hoped to increase the production to 300 megawatts by Sunday.\n\nShe said engineers were gradually increasing the speed of turbine generators to check the turbines' vibrations.",

So, they\u2019re offering big money to buy back their own stock. This year, big US companies have given the go-ahead for $286 billion of buybacks, up 88 percent from the same period last year, according to Birinyi Associates, a research firm. If the pace continues this year, the tally will exceed the record set in 2007.\n\nInvestors like buybacks because they suggest companies think their stock is cheap. They also help reduce the number of shares outstanding, which increases earnings per share. And higher earnings per share often, though not always, lead to rising stock prices.\n\nBut buybacks are also crucial to the rally for a reason that\u2019s not widely known. Companies are one of the few big stock purchasers now. Nearly every other big player in the market has been selling more than they\u2019ve been buying.\n\nHowever much they spend, each dollar of buybacks appears to be having a greater effect on raising the prices of certain stocks. That\u2019s because fewer shares are changing hands.\n\nStocks move up for many reasons, so the exact impact on prices of stocks when companies buy their shares is unclear. In any event, the total amount of buybacks doesn\u2019t appear to be enough to have a big effect on the whole market.\n\nBut some on Wall Street are worried.\n\nGregory Milano, CEO of consultancy Fortuna Advisors, has run studies showing that companies that spend the most on buying back their own stock tend to underperform because they don\u2019t spend enough on opening new factories, research, or otherwise building their business.\n\nAnother problem is that buybacks can give investors a false sense of a company\u2019s true earnings power.\n\nThe dilemma facing buyback skeptics who are thinking of selling is the same one facing those worried the rise in the market has come mostly from the Federal Reserve efforts to stimulate the economy. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t fight the Fed,\u2019\u2019 the old Wall Street saw goes.\n\nTo which should perhaps be added, \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t buck the buybacks.\u2019\u2019",

The second gets shot right after, or even overlaps a little with it, and the movies would hit theaters in December of 2012 and 2013.\u201cExploring Tolkien\u2019s Middle-earth goes way beyond a normal film-making experience,\u201d Jackson says in the release. \"It\u2019s an all-immersive journey into a very special place of imagination, beauty and drama.\" (And, he might have have added, an all-immersive journey into the vagaries of film financing.)There are questions both creative and marketing around the next pictures to be adapted from a J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy novel. The technological scope of Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy was groundbreaking, but in a post-\"Avatar\" world, that bar is now much higher.And while fanboys will scrutinize the movie with their own lens, the reception among the critics and awards community will be almost as interesting. After all, the third \"LOTR\" swept through the Oscars, but it took goodwill accumulated from the two previous movies. Will the first \"Hobbit\" get to build on that or will it need to start from scratch?There also will be an interesting race to the multiplex between \"The Hobbit\" and \"At the Mountains of Madness,\" another large-scale fantasy project, this one from the man who for a long time was going to direct \"Hobbit,\" Guillermo Del Toro. Both movies are expected to start production at roughly the same time, and comparisons and what-ifs inevitably will follow.Today, though, the fans are simply breathing a sigh of relief.

      "document": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Nuclear Nonproliferation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Numerous bi-partisan commissions and study groups, \n        including the Iraq Study Group co-chaired by James A. Baker III \n        and Lee H. Hamilton, a 2004 working group established under the \n        Council on Foreign Relations and co-chaired by Robert Gates and \n        Zbigniew Brzezinski, and a 2001 Atlantic Council of the United \n        States Working Group, co-chaired by Lee H. Hamilton, James \n        Schlesinger, and Brent Scowcroft have called for various forms \n        of dialogue and engagement with Iran in order to achieve United \n        States strategic interests in the Middle East region.\n            (2) Implementing effective strategies to deflect or deter \n        Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or pursuing the \n        development of nuclear weapons capabilities, is an important \n        United States strategic interest.\n            (3) Establishing a diplomatic dialogue with the Government \n        of Iran and deepening relationships with the Iranian people \n        would help foster greater understanding between the people of \n        Iran and the people of the United States and would enhance the \n        stability and security of the Persian Gulf region, including by \n        reducing the threat of the proliferation or use of nuclear \n        weapons in the region, while advancing other United States \n        foreign policy objectives in that region.\n            (4) The Iraq Study Group Report states ``Iran's interests \n        would not be served by a failure of U.S. policy that led to \n        chaos and the territorial disintegration of the Iraqi state'', \n        and therefore, the Government of the United States should build \n        upon this mutual interest to develop a diplomatic dialogue with \n        the Government of Iran concerning deteriorating conditions in \n        Iraq, which can become a basis of broader future United States-\n        Iranian engagement.\n            (5) Given the dispersal of Iran's nuclear program at sites \n        throughout the country and their proximity to urban centers, \n        the use of military force against Iran would be extraordinarily \n        difficult and probably ineffective, the immediate consequences \n        and loss of life would be drastic, and the long-term \n        instability generated would be against long-term United States \n        interests in the region.\n            (6) Any military action designed to eliminate Iran's \n        capacity to produce nuclear weapons would run the significant \n        risk of reinforcing and accelerating the desire of the \n        Government of Iran to acquire a nuclear deterrent and \n        compounding nationalist passions in defense of that very \n        course, and would most likely also generate hostile Iranian \n        initiatives in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n            (7) Together, the ongoing efforts of the International \n        Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) along with corresponding \n        multilateral sanctions recently adopted by the United Nations \n        Security Council offer a viable path for steering Iran's \n        nuclear efforts along peaceful lines, provided that there is \n        close multilateral coordination and steadfastness in the \n        adherence to the sanctions and firm United States leadership in \n        support of the multilateral effort.\n            (8) According to the most definitive United States \n        intelligence reports, Iran is likely a decade away from \n        acquiring the know-how and material to have an option to build \n        a nuclear weapon, and even the most pessimistic analysis by \n        outside experts puts the timeline at least three years away, \n        assuming Iran suffers no setbacks during development, which \n        would be unprecedented.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) full diplomatic, political, and economic relations \n        between the United States and Iran cannot be normalized unless \n        and until enforceable safeguards are put in place to prevent \n        weaponization of Iran's nuclear program and the Government of \n        Iran ends its support for international terrorist groups, but \n        the attainment of these policy objectives should not constitute \n        preconditions for any diplomatic dialogue; and\n            (2) no congressional authorization for the use of military \n        force in any Act of Congress enacted before the date of the \n        enactment of this Act constitutes, either implicitly or \n        explicitly, an authorization for the use of military force \n        against Iran or its nuclear program.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States not to enter into a \npreemptive war against Iran in the absence of an imminent threat, and \nthen only in accordance with international law and constitutional and \nstatutory requirements for congressional authorization.\n\nSEC. 5. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS.\n\n    No funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department \nof Defense or any other department or agency of the Government of the \nUnited States may be used to carry out any covert action for the \npurpose of causing regime change in Iran or to carry out any military \naction against Iran in the absence of an imminent threat, in accordance \nwith international law and constitutional and statutory requirements \nfor congressional authorization.",

4 ] . \n we report a rare case in which intratendinous tophaceous gout within the flexor digitorum superficialis ( fds ) tendon could not be differentiated from tubercular tenosynovitis or neoplasm preoperatively more so as it was seen in a patient with no prior history suggestive of hyperuricemia . \n a 45 years old man presented in our out patient department with complaint of inability to extend middle finger of his left hand along with a mass growing over volar aspect of forearm for over 2 months [ fig 1 ] . \n there was previous history of pain at wrist on finger movement which subsided gradually along with the decline in extension of middle finger . \n there was no associated history of fever , loss of weight or appetite , night sweats , malaise or fatigue . \n there was no history of trauma , pain in other joints of the body , morning stiffness of the back or hand joints , or continuous use of vibratory tools . \n hard mass around 2 * 2 cm was found over volar aspect of forearm just proximal to flexor retinaculam . \n it was non tender , non compressible , mobile at right angle to anatomical axis of forearm . \n movement at wrist was normal with restriction of movement of middle finger in sagittal plane . \n laboratory findings showed all within normal limits except serum uric acid which was 8.6 mg / dl . \n magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showed that the mass was within the fds which on axial t1 [ fig 2 ] appeared as heterogenous isointense lesion while on coronal t2 stir [ fig 3 ] showed heterogenous mixed hypointense  hyperintense lesion . \n clinical suspicion of tubercular tenosynovitis , soft tissue neoplasm and tophaceous gout was made and subsequently surgical exploration was performed . \n an incision along the flexor crease , extending further proximally while maintaining the longitudinal orientation taken . on longitudinal slit of thickened tendon sheath chalky white liquid emanated . \n on futher exploration there was whitish chalky infiltration of tendon of fds [ fig 4 ] , synovial adhesion of other tendons along with median nerve embedded within hypertrophied synovium of flexor tendons . since the mass was noted well proximal to flexor retinaculam that probably could be the reason for flexor contracture and sparing of median nerve . \n patient underwent synovectomy and tenotomy of fds to middle finger because of heavy intratendinous infiltration of the tophus along with destruction of the tendinous tissue . \n histopathological evaluation of the chalky white substance showed fibroconnective tissue showing hyalinized areas with evidence of saponification surrounded by palisades of foreign body type giant cells and chronic inflammatory cells . \n the postoperative course was uneventful with no remarkable functional deficit from the removal of the superficialis endon to the middle finger [ fig 6 ] . \n gout at the wrist as the initial appearance of the condition occurs between 0.8 to 2% of all gout cases . \n gout patients who are not treated have a 1930% chance of developing gout in the wrist during their lifetime . \n these nodules may not be recognized as tophi because the clinical diagnosis of gout in many instances is not straightforward . in the past reports , \n all intratendinous infiltrations of tophaceous gout occurred at the wrist and existed with carpal tunnel syndrome . \n we present an uncommon and unusual case of gout in the flexor tendon of forearm which occurred in isolation in a patient with no prior medical history of the recorded disease . \n measurement of serum uric acid level in chronic tophaceous gout may or may not be conclusive of hyperuricemia as some patients with diabetes or even alcoholics can have normal to lower levels   although fnac prior to definitive intervention would have helped us to achieve the diagnosis preoperatively but rather we had gone for definitive intervention but in no way over riding the role of fnac as the procedure of choice to achieve definitive diagnosis [ 8 ] . \n surgical intervention like tenotomy or tenosynovectomy are required to debulk tophaceous deposits , improve smooth gliding of tendon and decompress nerves but primarily medical management to treat gout remains the gold standard . \n short -

      "document": "If you are planning to rent a car over weekends this spring or summer, be prepared to face a miasma of complexities when searching for the most advantageous rates. You may, despite efforts of the rental agencies to make their peak-season operations more efficient, face long delays in picking up your car. You may end up with a car substantially different in size, features and fuel consumption - an important consideration because you will be paying for the gas - from the one you had reserved. You will certainly face rate structures that are confusing and subject to sudden change.\n\nIn some cases it may pay - in dollars and trouble saved - to pick up your car at an airport, where weekend rates tend to be cheaper than at Manhattan locations. Some people who rent on weekends also find it worthwhile to take the train part way, picking up their rental car at an office near the station. You should also carry employment identification and ask the person who handles travel for your company about corporate discounts that often can be used for personal as well as business rentals. Major rental companies frequently offer discounts but their clerks may not be able to apply them to your bill unless you know the appropriate identification number to be entered into the computer at the pick-up counter.\n\nRental rates can differ sharply from location to location in the metropolitan area, even within the same company. Airport weekend rental rates used to be higher than those offered in midtown or downtown locations; now they tend to be lower because that is where most cars are left at the end of one business week and needed at the beginning of the following one.\n\nMoreover, even if uniform rates are offered at a rental company's own offices, different rates may be charged by its licensees. Among these are gasoline stations that display the Hertz, Avis, National or Budget symbol and use the company's toll-free central reservations number but buy the cars themselves.\n\nFor these reasons, as the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs has pointed out often, it can be extremely difficult to comparison shop for a rental car by toll-free phone. Rates and other conditions quoted by central reservations offices frequently prove wrong, especially for licensees, when you go to pick up a car.\n\nA Hertz reservations agent told me by phone the other evening that her computer often does not show, until the day they become effective, new rates at Hertz outlets, 85 percent of which are company-owned. Dorothy Coffey, an Avis spokesman, said the situation in her company was similar.\n\nA confirmed advance reservation, however, supposedly protects you against any rate increase before you pick up the car. Ask for a written confirmation and allow enough time to receive it. Also, if you are dealing with a national company, ask the ''800'' clerk for the number of your reservation and take it with you to verify your reservation and rate if any dispute arises at the pickup counter.\n\nThe ''big three'' of the industry -Hertz, Avis and National - are competitive and tend to offer similar rates, at least in their own rental stations. Late on the afternoon of March 3l, Avis provided me with a rate structure for the New York area that became effective the following day. Given the rapidity with which rate structures can change, however, it may be out of date by the time you read this.\n\nIn its March 31 set of rates Avis abandoned, except for rentals that involved pick up in one city and drop off in another, the traditional time-and-mileage rates under which you paid so much a day and so much a mile. It has replaced them with structures that allow either unlimited mileage or a certain number of free miles, plus a per-mile charge above that. The company is offering one-day rates, weekend rates, weekly rates and monthly rates, all with different conditions. Different parts of the metropolitan area had substantially different structures.\n\nFor example, a Friday noon to Monday noon rental of a so-called economy-size car such as a Chevrolet Chevette or Ford Pinto was priced at $18.88 a day, with unlimited mileage, when picked up and returned to Kennedy, LaGuardia or Newark Airports. When picked up in Manhattan and returned to the same office there, it cost $31.50 a day but with only 125 free miles, and .25 cents a mile above that. When picked up and returned to Rego Park, Queens, it cost $31.95 a day with unlimited mileage. At company offices on Long Island the rate was $19.50 a day with unlimited mileage. In Westchester and Connecticut it was $16.95 a day with unlimited mileage when returned to the city where the car was picked up. All these rates were quoted on a three-day basis; the rate rises if the rental is only for two days.\n\nIn Queens and the suburbs, it cost from $2 to $5 a day more to rent the next-larger size car, such as a two-door Chevrolet Citation or two-door Oldsmobile Omega. In Manhattan, however, both sizes were priced the same. At the airports, the bigger car cost $15 a day more than the smaller.",

      "document": "LONDON \u2014 The British government backed a set of recommendations on Monday to improve standards in the banking industry, including measures that could have bankers in Britain facing prison time for poor business decisions.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said the government would adopt the wide-ranging proposals presented last month by a parliamentary commission on banking standards. Osborne had asked the commission to come up with ways to improve the banking system and make banking executives more accountable for their actions after the financial crisis and a handful of recent banking scandals.\n\n\u201cThe government is determined to raise standards across the banking industry to create a stronger and safer banking system,\u201d Osborne said in a statement. \u201cCultural reform in the banking sector marks the next step in the government\u2019s plan to move the whole sector from rescue to recovery,\u201d he said.\n\nThe steps are part of the government\u2019s wider efforts to restore trust in the banking sector as a way to support a recovery of the British economy. Osborne said that he hoped a more stable banking system would increase lending to businesses, spur growth, and create more jobs.\n\nA string of trading scandals and continued high pay for some of Britain\u2019s bankers have led to widespread public anger and prompted the government to look into tightening rules on conduct and pay.\n\nThe government plans to make \u201creckless misconduct for senior bankers\u201d a criminal offense. Those found guilty could face a prison sentence.\n\nThe step would be \u201ca helpful deterrent\u201d against senior executives risking giant losses at banks that would result in a government bailout and cost taxpayers billions of dollars, officials say.\n\nBritish lawmakers said the new legislation is aimed at making financiers more cautious when deciding on the bank\u2019s strategy and investments.\n\nPublic anger in Britain has focused on Frederick A. Goodwin, who managed Royal Bank of Scotland when it went on an ill-advised acquisition spree. He left the bank with a large retirement package as the government had to rescue the bank and the banking system from the brink of collapse.\n\nOsborne also pledged to work with the financial regulators to allow bonuses to be deferred for as many as 10 years and for entire bonuses to be clawed back at banks that required government aid.",

      "document": "SAN YSIDRO, Calif., Dec. 10\u2014 The Immigration and Naturalization Service has told border agents to be on the lookout for two assassination squads from Libya, including one headed by the notorious international terrorist known as Carlos and dubbed ''the Jackal'' by the British press.\n\nA seven-page notice, posted in the employees' lunchroom at the nation's busiest border-crossing point on the Mexican border south of San Diego, alerts agents to watch for squads of terrorists reportedly dispatched by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, to assassinate President Reagan and other senior officials in the Administration.\n\nThe document, dated Dec. 6, warns that two ''hit'' teams ''may attempt to enter the United States illegally with the help of established smugglers familiar with the U.S.-Mexican border.''\n\nThe notice says the hit squad reportedly headed by Carlos consists of three Syrians and three Libyans. It also says a second group consists of two Iranians, a Palestinian, a Lebanese and an East German.\n\nThe notice, issued by the Washington headquarters of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, says that Carlos, a 32-yearold Venezuelan whose real name is Illich Ramirez Sanchez, is believed to be traveling on a Lebanese passport under an assumed name. Similar Notice on Clipboard\n\nA border control agent in Nogales, Ariz., said a similar notice had been put on a clipboard available only to employees at the crossing there. The agent, who declined to be identified, said the notice was posted either Wednesday or today.\n\nIt could not be immediately determined if the notice was posted at other stations on the Mexican border or at any other entry points. James O'Keefe, district director of Immigration in San Diego, said today that the border crossing was ''operating normally.'' He and inspectors at the border declined further comment, referring questions to Washington.\n\nReporters were refused admission to the facility today, but no extraordinary precautions could be observed at the entry point, where about 40 million crossings into the United States are made every year.\n\nIn Washington, Vernon Jervis, spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, refused to discuss any aspect of the document.\n\n''It's a matter that's extremely sensitive, involving national security,'' Mr. Jervis said. The notice includes a reproduction of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police poster of Carlos that describes him as a heavyset man who is 5 feet 9 inches tall with thick brown, curly hair and ''skilled at changing appearance and identity.''\n\nBeginning in August 1970, when he underwent commando training in Jordan, Carlos has devoted most of his energies to killing for the Palestinian cause. He is wanted in connection with the slaying of Israeli athletes at the Olympic games in Munich in 1972, the shooting of Edward Sieff, a British Zionist, in 1973, the kidnapping of 11 oil ministers attending the OPEC conference in Vienna in 1975 and the assassination of Ramon Trabal, a Uruguayan military attache. Members of Teams Named\n\nThe notice listed Hasan Al-Khayer, Ali Ahmed and Walid Abdul Rahman as Syrian nationals who are members of the assassination team, and Omar or Umar Ayad and Ali Saghayer as Libyan nationals. It also listed a man variously named Mohamed or Milad Muhammad el-Hadi or Hadi, also known as Milad Muhammad Hadi or Muhamammd Ibraham Al-Hadi on that team.\n\nA second team included Ahmed Jooma, also known as Ahmad Juma or Abase Said or Ahmed Husayn Juma, an Iranian, about 25; Luitz Schewesman, an East German, about 50; Ahmat Abass, or Ahmed Abbas or Mouses Abou Mahmoud, a Palestianian, about 35; Ibrahim El Haya, an Iranian, about 36 and also known as Ibrahim El-Haya, Ibraham ElHaya, Ibrahim Al-Haya, Ibrahim Al Haya, Ali Ben Ali, Ali Ben-Ali; and Ali Chafio, a Lebanese, about 35.",

But biologists concede they are speculating, based on the behavior of similar whales. Members of this species have never been seen or examined in any detail before. The two carcasses have been dug up for further study. Why they beached themselves is a mystery, say the scientists.\n\n\u201cBased on the scarcity of records and the total absence of previous sightings, this species is the least known species of whale and one of the world\u2019s rarest living mammals,\u201d write Constantine and her colleagues in their report in Current Biology.\n\n\u201cThis is good reminder,\u201d said Constantine, \u201cof how large the oceans are, and of how little we know about them.\u201d",

Now new findings may help us better understand how palate cleansers like wine or tea refresh our mouths between courses.\n\nA study, published on Monday in Current Biology, enlisted 21 volunteers to rate the feelings in their mouth after repeatedly sipping either tea or water while eating salami.\n\nWhen subjects ate fatty food, they experienced a \u201cfatty mouth feel\u201d \u2014 a sensation that their mouths felt slippery or coated, said senior author of the study, Paul A.S. Breslin, a professor of nutritional sciences at Rutgers University and member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cIf they are sipping tea while they eat this meat, then that tea helped bring the \u2018fatty mouth feel\u2019 back down again, more so when compared to sipping just water,\u201d he said.\n\nThese findings show that sipping an astringent beverage can counteract the oral sensation of fatty foods during a meal.\n\nPalate cleansers feel astringent or dry in our mouths because they contain compounds that break down the lubricating proteins in our saliva, Breslin said. This is what allows them to provide a sensation of cleanness in our mouths by removing after-tastes and fatty mouth-coating sensations.\n\n\u201cIf you notice how we eat fatty foods in general, we tend to pair them with something astringent,\u201d Breslin said. \u201cThey go together because they balance each other out.\n\n\u201cThis is a principle in cuisines throughout the world.\u201d\n\nOne nutrition expert not involved with the study agreed.\n\n\u201cThe process of dining involves a back and forth interplay of astringency and fat,\u201d said Dr. Jana Klauer, a New York City-based physician who specializes in nutrition, \u201cThe French have long known this.\u201d\n\nIn a typical French meal, she explained, you consume an aperitif \u2014 which is astringent \u2014 then a creamy soup, then a main course with some fat balanced with an astringent wine, then a palate-cleansing sorbet, and lastly, a dessert containing fat.\n\nSo food-lovers around the globe may have another reason to rejoice. Whether you consume a juicy steak with red wine, salad dressing containing oil and vinegar, or sushi with a side of ginger, these and other complementary pairings of fat and astringency may be good for our bodies, Breslin said.\n\n\u201cThis natural tendency for seeking balance in our mouths might have benefits for maintaining a diversity of foods in our diet.\u201d",

Promoters must know that, because they trot out the argument from pure economics only when they want to wring more concessions out of a hard-pressed city, or, having been denied concessions, to go elsewhere. They don't talk like that when they ask for fan loyalty, or when they fight their players' demands for more money.\n\nMr. Burman also dismisses too lightly the argument that poor support for a team is management's fault, not the fans'. I know of no team in any sport not newly established that has failed to get the backing it deserved. But if Mr. Burman's principles are ever openly accepted, such considerations won't matter any more and we'll have lost the last distinction between sports and commodity speculation. JEFFREY M.

A ripening trade battle might put that to the test.\n\nAs part of trade talks, the European Union wants to ban the use of such European names as Parmesan, feta, and Gorgonzola on cheese made in the United States.\n\nThe argument is that the American-made cheeses are shadows of the original European varieties and cut into the sales and identity of the European cheeses. The Europeans say Parmesan should come only from Parma, Italy, not from those familiar green cylinders US companies sell. Feta should be only from Greece, even though feta isn\u2019t a place. The European Union argues it \u2018\u2018is so closely connected to Greece as to be identified as an inherently Greek product.\u2019\u2019\n\nSo, a little \u2018\u2018hard-grated cheese\u2019\u2019 for your pasta? It doesn\u2019t have quite the same ring as Parmesan.\n\nUS dairy producers, cheesemakers, and other food companies are fighting the idea, which they say would hurt the $4 billion domestic cheese industry and confuse consumers.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s really stunning that the Europeans are trying to claw back products made popular in other countries,\u2019\u2019 says Jim Mulhern, president of the National Milk Producers Federation, which represents dairy farmers.\n\nThe European Union would not say exactly what it is proposing or whether it will be discussed this week at a new round of talks on an EU-US free trade agreement.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Roger Waite would say only that the question \u2018\u2018is an important issue for the EU.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s clear from recent agreements with Canada and Central America, where certain cheese names were restricted unless the cheese came from Europe. Under the Canadian agreement, for example, new feta products manufactured in Canada can only be marketed as feta-like or feta-style, and they can\u2019t use Greek letters or other symbols of Greece.\n\nThe European Union is expected to make similar attempts to restrict marketing of US-made cheeses, possibly including Parmesan, Asiago, Gorgonzola, feta, fontina, Muenster, Neufchatel, and Romano.\n\nAnd it may not be just cheese. Other products could include bologna, Black Forest ham, and Valencia oranges.\n\nThe trade negotiations are important for the EU because Europe is trying to protect its share of agricultural exports and pull itself out of recession. The ability to exclusively sell some of the continent\u2019s most famous and traditional products would prevent others from cutting into those markets.\n\nA bipartisan group of 55 senators wrote to US Trade Representative Michael Froman and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack this week, asking them not to agree to any such EU proposals.\n\nCompanies that mass-produce cheese are also fighting. Kraft Foods Group says cheese names are considered generic in the United States. \u2018\u2018Such restrictions could not only be costly to food makers, but also potentially confusing for consumers,\u201d spokesman Basil Maglaris says.",

He wrote the scores for ''Guys and Dolls,'' ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,'' ''The Most Happy Fella,'' ''Where's Charley?'' and ''Greenwillow.'' Out of these came such popular tunes as ''Once in Love With Amy,'' ''Luck Be a Lady,'' ''Big D,'' ''Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat,'' ''Standing on the Corner'' and ''I Believe in You.'' It was Mr. Morse, in fact, who sang ''I Believe in You'' in ''How to Succeed.''\n\n''More of Loesser'' will run through May 1. The early performances, at 9:30 P.M., Monday through Saturday, are dinner shows. There are also late shows Friday and Saturday at 11:30 P.M., with a two-drink minimum. The cover charge is $12.50, Monday through Friday; $15 on Saturday. Call 872-6140 for reservations. TREE CARE\n\nThe care and feeding of trees might seem like a lecture topic more appropriate for suburbia than New York, but the cement-lined city apparently has enough trees to warrant such a discussion. It will take place today at 6 P.M. at the Urban Center, 457 Madison Avenue.\n\nThe free lecture, called ''Take Care of Your Street Trees,'' is sponsored by the Parks Council, a determined group that has been concerned with New York's parks and open spaces for 55 years. Speakers include Jon Hickey, the arborist, who will give tips on helping your neighborhood trees to survive; and Cara Lee, director of educational services for the Environmental Action Coalition, who will describe resources available to help in the care of trees.\n\nCall the Parks Council at 838-9410 for reservations. A cash bar will be open from 5:30 P.M. ANGKOR EXHIBITION\n\nNational Geographic photographs showing the scars and remaining splendors of ancient Angkor after a decade of war and neglect in Cambodia go on show today at the United Nations.\n\nA vast complex of temples and monuments, Angkor is one of the architectural wonders of the world. A dozen Khmer kings made Angkor their royal capital, and it flourished from the ninth to the 13th century. Since 1972, Angkor has been virtually closed to the outside world, and all archeological restoration work there has stopped.\n\nA National Geographic team headed by an editor, Wilbur E. Garrett, who took most of the photographs, made a study of Angkor last fall. The team found that war, vandalism and theft had scarred the temples superficially, but that ''the implacable jungle threatens their very existence.'' The worst problem is water dripping and seeping into the sandstone and brick structures.\n\nThe photographic exhibition, produced by the National Geographic Society under the sponsorship of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco), includes more than 50 color photomurals of Angkor. To dramatize Angkor's immensity, the show features a 50-foot-long photograph of a bas-relief on a wall of Angkor Wat, the most famous temple in the Angkor complex.\n\nThe exhibition, in the General Assembly Public Lobby, First Avenue and 46th Street, is free and open to the public daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. BACH TRADITION\n\nBach's St. Matthew Passion is a Holy Week tradition for Musica Sacra. The organization will perform it tonight at 7:30 at Avery Fisher Hall, with Richard Westenburg, founder of Musica Sacra, conducting.\n\nThe story of Christ's final hours, the St. Matthew Passion was composed in 1728 and 1729 in Leipzig, where it was first performed on Good Friday 1729. In the Musica Sacra presentation, Mr. Westenburg adheres to the intimate scale of the original performance, which Bach himself conducted. There will be two choruses, each with about 18 voices and two orchestras of chamber players. Mr. Westenburg will conduct from the harpsichord.\n\nTickets are $9, $12 and $16.

      "document": "If you are planning to pile into your family car and roam around the Northeast on vacation this year, you may be in for some disappointments. If you do not plan carefully - two words that until recently were rarely in the travel vocabulary of visitors to the region - you may find interminably long lines at some destinations and restaurants, and difficulty in obtaining a convenient motel room.\n\nChanging travel patterns in recent years, among them the startling increase in the numbers of groups traveling by bus, the tendency of Americans to stay closer to home rather than vacation in Europe and the growing number of Europeans visiting the Northeast, have made it harder to travel in the area. Instead of simply selecting a general area of interest, such as central New England, and then piecing your vacation together as you go along, you may have to do substantially more planning. You may have to reserve overnight accommodations weeks in advance and thereby commit yourself to an itinerary. You may have to schedule your sightseeing carefully to avoid crowds that, at some attractions with limited capacity, could grow so large that you might not be able to see them at all. And you might even find it advantageous to take one of those bus tours, rather than travel by car.\n\nThe tourist industry in the Northeast is so highly developed and large that it can accommodate many more visitors than go to the area now. But some widely publicized attractions, such as Old Sturbridge Village in central Massachusetts, Mystic Seaport in northeastern Connecticut and the waterfront mansions of Newport, R.I., seem to be on almost everyone's northeast vacation itinerary.\n\nNot just the itineraries of family groups, but also those of bus tours, which have proliferated this year to an extent that a few years ago seemed beyond imagination. This could mean long lines at popular destinations, especially smaller ones.\n\n''With us, it's first come, first served, regardless of how you arrive,'' said David Wood, curator of the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass. ''It's every man for himself and the Devil take the last.'' He said the museum, which was the home of the late magazine illustrator and now displays about 60 of his paintings, could accommodate 100 visitors at a time. ''Normally we conduct halfhour guided tours,'' Mr. Wood said, ''but sometimes we must suspend them.''\n\nSome of the operators of bus tours, such as Tauck, Maupintour, Four Winds, Casser, Michaud, Trailways, Blue Bird and Talmage, have been in business for years. This year they have been joined by well-known European tour operators, among them Globus-Gateway and Thomas Cook. In addition, the charter bus business - the rental of buses to fraternal lodges, employee associations and other groups - has grown enormously.\n\nSome tour operators' coaches are luxurious, their guides well informed and well trained, their overnight accommodations superior and their meals of the best quality available. For vacationers traveling alone or in pairs, especially those who want to be free of virtually every problem, every decision, a bus tour may be ideal.\n\nIf such be your choice, remember this: Do not be turned off by the wide diversity in prices. Tours are like most things that are for sale: You get what you pay for. If the operator has a good reputation - and your travel agent or friends can tell you about this - you will usually find that added expense means added quality.\n\nAmong the new offerings this year, available through travel agents, is Thomas Cook's eight-day ''New England Sampler'' from New York at $697 a person. The price includes lodgings but only those meals specified in the itinerary, so read the brochure carefully. Globus-Gateway, whose parent company is Swiss, has entered the North American market with programs that include nine days in Canada, the Adirondacks and New England, beginning in Montreal and ending in Boston, at $668 to $688 a person.\n\nThe forces behind the changing patterns in tourism in the Northeast - and elsewhere - start, of course, with the gasoline situation, characterized until recently by steadily increasing prices and occasional shortages. As a result, many vacationers began to forsake the family car in favor of tours, which they often found to be cheaper. Many people who refused to abandon vacations by car, on the other hand, began to forsake long-distance vacations and roam much closer to home. In the last couple of years, again reflecting the soaring cost of energy, fares on public transportation have zoomed, except for a few bargains in highly competitive areas.\n\nUntil the recent strengthening of the dollar, meanwhile, foreign exchange rates resulted in increases in costs for Americans vacationing overseas. Many Americans decided to ''see America first.'' And many foreigners, who found travel in dollar areas to be a bargain, began to flock to the United States, largely on group tours. In short, in popular, scenic, historic regions like the Northeast, both group travel and independent travel burgeoned at the same time.",
      "summary": "If you are planning to pile into your family car and roam around the Northeast on vacation this year, you may be in for some disappointments. If you do not plan carefully - two words that until recently were rarely in the travel vocabulary of visitors to the region - you may find interminably long lines at some destinations and restaurants, and difficulty in obtaining a convenient motel room.    Changing travel patterns in recent years, among them the startling increase in the numbers of groups traveling by bus, the tendency of Americans to stay closer to home rather than vacation in Europe and the growing number of Europeans visiting the Northeast, have made it harder to travel in the area. Instead of simply selecting a general area of interest, such as central New England, and then piecing your vacation together as you go along, you may have to do substantially more planning. You may have to reserve overnight accommodations weeks in advance and thereby commit yourself to an itinerary. You may have to schedule your sightseeing carefully to avoid crowds that, at some attractions with limited capacity, could grow so large that you might not be able to see them at all. And you might even find it advantageous to take one of those bus tours, rather than travel by car.",

      "document": "although in most cases ( 8090% ) the ingested foreign body will pass uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract , sharp foreign bodies such as toothpicks are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding . \n the most common causes of the accidental ingestion of toothpicks include alcoholism , rapid food intake and decreased palatal sensitivity . \n although the complications caused by swallowed toothpicks are more likely to be detected and resolved by surgical procedure in selected cases when it is possible to locate the position of the toothpick , endoscopic removal can result in the rapid relief of symptoms [ 3 , 4 ] . \n a 57-year - old caucasian woman with no previous medical history was admitted to the department of internal medicine , division of gastroenterology , clinical hospital split . \n she complained of fever and abdominal pain located in right upper quadrant for one week . \n vital signs were as follows : blood pressure 120/80 mm hg , pulse rate 100 bpm and core body temperature 39.0c . \n laboratory evaluation revealed a wbc count of 12.5  10/l with a left shift and c - reactive protein concentration of 123.6 mg / l while urinalysis as well as other relevant laboratory data were within reference values . \n abdominal ultrasound examination was performed because of a clinical presentation mimicking acute cholecystitis , but it was within normal ranges . however , contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) scan with three - phase protocol showed an unclearly outlined lesion within the liver parenchyma with a longer diameter of 2.1 cm and which could not be clearly separated from eccentric radiopaque thickening of the stomach antrum in an extension of more than 4 cm ( fig . 1 , fig . \n this finding indicated gastroscopy , which revealed a sharp wooden foreign body protruding from the antrum mucosa and the whole wooden foreign body ( toothpick ) was successfully removed by snare extraction without complications . \n after the extraction of the foreign body the patient remembered that two weeks earlier when consuming lamb she might possibly have swallowed a toothpick . \n the patient was also treated with a proton pump inhibitor ( pantoprasole ) , the intravenous administration of crystalloids and ceftriaxone for seven days . \n impaction , perforation and obstruction most often occur in areas of acute angulation or physiologic narrowing . \n it is difficult to estimate the incidence of accidental ingestion of toothpicks , mostly because the literature covering this issue is anecdotal . \n in contrast to this , it is well known that toothpick lesions to the gastrointestinal tract are often associated with significant morbidity and mortality [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] . \n clinical presentation of toothpick gastrointestinal injury includes generalized or local peritonitis , intestinal obstruction or gastrointestinal hemorrhage . in \n some cases toothpicks migrated outside the gastrointestinal tract and were found in the pleura , pericardium , ureter or bladder [ 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . ingested toothpicks in the esophagus and small intestines are presented by dysphagia or intestinal colic while foreign objects remaining in the stomach are often asymptomatic . early diagnosis and retrieval of \n the toothpick is critical for reducing morbidity and mortality [ 3 , 8 , 9 ] . \n therefore , we think that a patient presenting with gram - positive bacteremia and no sign of free perforation of the gastrointestinal tract is very illustrative because this demonstrates the necessity of thinking of foreign body ingestion as a cause of obscure bacteremias . \n we would like to emphasize how important it is to make a very careful anamnesis in order to determine swallowed foreign objects , such as a toothpick , as a rare cause of bacteremia . moreover , there are no relevant physical or laboratory findings characteristic for a swallowed toothpick . \n ct images are useful in acquiring missing clinical information such as toothpick location . in cases without free perforation ,",

It was packed on Wednesday night for the final program of the fourth season of the Lyric Chamber Music Society of New York.\n\nOne hopes the turnout will not tempt this adventurous society into moving its concerts elsewhere. The gallery is exactly the type of intimate space for which chamber music was intended. Even the genial Saint-Sa\u00ebns Sonata for Clarinet and Piano, which opened the program, sounded like a significant work in that setting.\n\nBeing so close to the excellent clarinetist Vadim Lando and the pianist Richard Bishop made a big difference in the impact of the music, especially Mr. Lando's subdued pianissimo playing. Mr. Lando showcased his virtuosity in the ''Rigoletto'' Fantasia di Concerto for Clarinet and Piano, a pastiche of tunes from that Verdi opera turned into an unabashed display piece by the principal clarinetist of La Scala in Verdi's day.\n\nThe evening's other guest artist was the amazing bassoonist Martin Kuuskmann, who is intent on having a successful solo career, not exactly common among players of his instrument. Mr. Kuuskmann has won considerable notice for his dynamic performances with the Absolute Ensemble, especially his solo turn in Michael Daugherty's ''Dead Elvis,'' which Mr. Kuuskmann performs as an Elvis impersonator, complete with gyrations and glittery costume.\n\nOn this evening he was just himself, that is to say, an easygoing young musician from Estonia.\n\nMr. Kuuskmann played stunningly in Variations Concertantes for Bassoon and Piano by Ida Gotkovsky, who teaches at the Paris conservatory.\n\nThis conservatively modern work explores every tonal and technical potential of the bassoon. Mr. Kuuskmann should be grateful to Mr. Bishop for playing the dauntingly hard piano transcription of the original orchestra part so well. How often will the pianist get to play this curiosity in the future?\n\nMr. Kuuskmann also delivered a gripping account of the Swiss-born composer Daniel Schnyder's restless, perky, jazz-infused 1995 Sonata for Bassoon and Piano, which also gave Mr. Bishop another workout.\n\nBut at least he may get more chances to play it, since the work was intended for soprano saxophone, B-flat clarinet or oboe, and was appropriated for bassoon by the determined Mr. Kuuskmann.",

He said that the American decision to build neutron weapons constituted ''a provocation to all peoples struggling for a peaceful future'' and that Europe ''must achieve arms control and disarmament and needs no new arsenals.''\n\nThe parade commemorated the events of Aug. 13, 1961, when security forces began sealing off the border between East and West Berlin to halt the flow of East Germans who were fleeing their country by the thousands each day.\n\nIn his address to the troops, Mr. Honecker called the building of the wall a victory for Communism, saying it had consolidated and strengthened East Germany and had opened the way to East-West negotiations and detente.\n\nThe Western allies protested the military parade, saying it constituted ''a violation of the demilitarized status of the city laid down by the wartime and postwar agreements.''\n\nThe protest by the United States, Britain and France said the event was all the more deplorable since it was intended ''to commemorate the illegal and inhuman construction of the Berlin wall in defiance of the most fundamental human rights.''\n\nWilly Brandt, the former West German Chancellor, who was Mayor of West Berlin when the wall was built, recalled in a recent interview the shock suffered by most Germans when the wall went up, but he added that it had been clear long before then ''that the Western powers were not going to challenge Soviet rights or fight for German unity.''\n\nMr. Brandt, who is the Social Democratic Party leader, said the final division of Berlin and of Germany had made him reassess the political situation and embark on his policy of seeking detente with West Germany's eastern neighbors. ''After Aug. 13 we had to find new ways to keep up human contacts and make it possible for people to cross the monstrous border line,'' he said.\n\nUnder a 1971 agreement between the Western powers and the Soviet Union, West Berliners can get passes to visit friends and realtives in the East. Most East Germans are still barred from crossing, with the exception of old-age pensioners, who can visit the West several times a year.",

      "document": "twenty - eight post mortem lower eyelids ( 14 right , 14 left ) from 16 japanese cadavers were examined and divided into 2 groups . \n one group of 14 lower eyelids of 7 cadavers ( 7 right , 7 left ; 3 males , 4 females ) with an average age at death of 80.4 years ( range : 73~97 ) , were sagittally incised from the lower lacrimal punctum ( figure 1 ) . \n the other 14 lower eyelids of 9 cadavers ( 7 right , 7 left ; 4 males , 5 females ) with an average age at death of 76.3 years ( range : 69~95 ) were incised from the lower lacrimal punctum with 5 degrees lateral inclination to the sagittal plane ( figure 1 ) . \n all cadavers were registered in the cadaveric service of aichi medical university , with proper consent from our institutional review board and approval to use them for educational purposes and studies . \n all methods for securing human tissue were humane and complied with the tenets of the declaration of helsinki . \n in the first group , which underwent a strict sagittal incision , 10 canaliculi of 7 cadavers ( 6 right , 4 left ; male 5 eyelids , female 5 eyelids ) were interrupted at the halfway point of the vertical portion and so the distal part of the canaliculi were not included ( figures 2a , b ) . \n however , 4 canaliculi of 4 cadavers ( 1 right , 3 left ; male 1 eyelids , female 3 eyelids ) did include the whole length of the vertical portion . in the second group with 5 degrees \n laterally inclined incision , all specimens included the whole length of the vertical portion ( figures 3a , b ) . \n most vertical portions of the lower lacrimal canaliculus examined here demonstrated a laterally inclined course of approximately 5 degrees ( figure 4 ) . \n the course of the laterally directed vertical portion of the lacrimal canaliculus should be considered not only in lacrimal probing , syringing , and trephining but also in eyelid surgeries . \n the 5 degrees lateral inclination of the vertical portion significantly emphasizes the need of a laterally directed insertion and lateral lid traction during the passage of a lacrimal probe , syringing needle or trephine to accord with the true course of the vertical portion . as well , since the vertical portion takes its lateral course within 1 mm laterally from the lacrimal punctum ( whitnall 1979 ; hwang et al 2005 ) , surgeons , during eyelid surgery , need to recognize the area within 1 mm laterally from the punctum as being a zone with a potential for serious lacrimal canalicular injury . \n the vertical portion changes its direction medially because of the inward eyelid movement ( kakizaki et al 2005 ) caused by the contraction of horner s muscle . at this time \n , the closure of the vertical portion may become insufficient , because the relative angle of the muscle of riolan and the vertical portion of the lacrimal canaliculus becomes milder . to maintain the relative perpendicular angle to each other , \n although all the cadavers were in an eye - closed state , and the muscle tonus of the orbicularis oculi had been completely lost , this state would have been similar to the eye - opening state in live humans whose muscle tonus of the orbicularis oculi is little . as the lacrimal probing syringing and trephining \n is usually performed in eye - opening state , the present result is reasonable for the true clinical situations . \n first , as the study samples were all taken from elderly cadavers , we may not be able to apply the results to younger generations . \n confirming our results in a younger patient population through clinical procedures such as lacrimal probing is possible . \n our experience is that the lateral inclination of a probe usually enables easy lacrimal probing , even in young generations . \n second , as we did not examine samples of caucasians or blacks , we can not conclude that they have the same inclination . \n however , to date , racial variations have not been reported with regard to the lacrimal drainage system ; therefore , we may be able to speculate that they have the same inclination . in conclusion , \n most vertical portions of the lower lacrimal canaliculus are directed laterally at approximately 5 degrees . \n surgeons need to recognize the true course so as not to cause injury to the vertical portion of the lower lacrimal canaliculus . \n this anatomical view will be helpful for a better understanding of the lacrimal drainage system .",
      "summary": "the nomenclature of each part of the lacrimal canaliculus , for example the vertical portion , does not always reflect the true course . since we have sometimes observed findings suggesting the so called vertical portion of the lower lacrimal canaliculus inclined laterally , we re - examined the course of the vertical portion . \n twenty - eight postmortem lower eyelids in 16 japanese were examined and divided into 2 groups . \n the first group was 14 lower eyelids of 7 cadavers . \n eyelids were incised sagittally from the lower lacrimal punctum . \n the second group was 14 lower eyelids of 9 cadavers ; these were incised from the lower lacrimal punctum with 5 degrees lateral inclination to the sagittal plane . in the first group , \n 10 canaliculi of 7 cadavers were interrupted at the halfway point of the vertical portion . \n four canaliculi of 4 cadavers included the whole length of the vertical portion . in the second group , \n all specimens included the whole length of the vertical portion . \n most vertical portions of the lower lacrimal canaliculus demonstrated a laterally inclined course of approximately 5 degrees , although some took a completely vertical course .",

      "document": "although great enthusiasm exists for developing skills in laparoscopic urology in the united kingdom , training opportunities are limited . \n this is primarily due to a lack of approved urology / laparoscopy fellowships , as exist in the united states . \n it is an unfortunate fact that many interested urologists do not progress beyond the initial courses stage and indeed a number of urologists who have attended animal laboratory training as well have not proceeded to regular urological laparoscopic practice . \n fellowship , enabling supervised training so that interested urologists could become comfortable and competent with laparoscopic urology . \n the fellowship program is available to those who have completed the 2 initial training steps , ie , basic / advanced training courses and an animal laboratory course . \n prior practice on simulators using laparoscopic instruments is encouraged to enable the trainees to get the most out of their time spent with the mentor in the clinical setting . \n basic training is centered on the development of familiarity with the safe handling of laparoscopic instrumentation and stereoscopic skills in the dry laboratory setting . \n advanced training involves a series of formal lectures followed by practice sessions in the animal laboratory ; attendees are also shown live surgery via video links . \n skills training is assessed by the mentor in these phases by objectively marking the achievement of various predetermined parameters that evaluate safe acquisition of laparoscopic skills like clipping and suturing . \n the fellowship program steps are broadly similar thereafter , but individual variations may occur , depending on the distance that the trainee has to travel and availability of the mentor . \n an honorary contract is raised for the trainee at the mentor hospital ; the trainee then observes the mentor perform 4 or 5 laparoscopic renal procedures and may assist with the same by acting as the camera driver for these cases . \n if possible , trainees then refer cases suitable for laparoscopic surgery to the mentor ; this helps gestate the necessary workload . \n the first 4 cases that are performed by the trainee are usually hand - assisted simple or radical nephrectomies , and the aim is to perform at least a case a week at a dedicated theater session with the possibility of adding in more cases as appropriate . \n the trainee then goes on to perform conventional laparoscopic cases , again under mentor supervision , with the mentor initially acting as camera driver . \n this program duration varies but is approximately 4 to 5 months , primarily due to the paucity of clinical material available in any one unit at a time , and secondly , to fit in with other work commitments . \n mentors are then awarded an honorary contract at the trainees ' hospital to supervise the trainees during their first few cases therein . \n trainees schedule simple cases initially and gradually increase the level of difficulty as their skills and confidence improve . \n six of them are in independent laparoscopic urological practice , and the others are in phase 6 or above . \n trainee one started this program in september 2000 and observed 4 simple nephrectomies and 1 radical nephrectomy before proceeding to phase 6 . \n because of the distance involved , the mentor condensed stages 4 and 5 and performed 12 cases with the trainee at the trainee 's hospital before the trainee entered independent practice . since then , he has performed 14 unsupervised laparoscopic urological procedures . \n trainee two started the program in may 2001 and has performed 10 procedures with the mentor ; he was fortunate to obtain further hands - on training abroad , which helped shorten his training . \n trainee three , four , five , and six started the program in may 2002 and performed 10 procedures each with the mentor , before commencing unsupervised practice . \n trainees seven , eight , and nine are making steady progress , currently performing hand - assisted procedures with the mentor who is offering support and advice without actually being scrubbed in for the procedure . \n it is anticipated that over the next few months trainees seven , eight , and nine will adopt independent practice . \n skills development in all cases was steady , with a progressive increase in dexterity and improvement in spatial orientation . \n for the neophyte laparoscopist , it is indeed a great leap of faith that has to be taken from the animal laboratory to the human arena ; we perceive the main stumbling block to be a lack of direct mentor / trainee supervision . \n this program was designed to allow skill and confidence building under the direct supervision and guidance of experienced laparoscopic urologists , as initially suggested by shalhav . in effect , this reduces the conversion rate and complications that otherwise could be a major issue ; therefore , the transition to independent urological practice appears to be smoother . \n we also believe that the selective use of hand assistance early in the program helps build confidence and aids in development of 3-dimensional spatial orientation ; secondly , the ability to directly apply digital pressure exists in case of unexpected vascular injury . \n once trainees are facile with hand - assisted laparoscopic practice , they are then encouraged to move on towards pure laparoscopic and retroperitoneoscopic procedures ; all trainees agreed that the initial phase helped them make the transition more easily . \n the case load at one particular hospital may not be enough to enable concentrated dissemination of laparoscopic skills . as a result , \n sometimes trainees have had to spend up to 4 weeks on occasion without performing a single laparoscopic case ; this in turn has a bearing on the length of the fellowship program . \n it is not easy to put a finite number onto the number of mentored cases that would have to be performed by trainees before proceeding to independent practice because this appears to depend on innate skills , but 10 cases would seem to approximate an acceptable mean . \n some trainees have had to forfeit other obligations for the duration of the fellowship , which they could not have done without support from their colleagues and the management in their respective hospitals . \n we acknowledge unstinting support from anaesthetic colleagues , given the fact that anaesthetic / procedure time needs to be acceptable ; this has obviously not always been the case when a new trainee joins the fellowship program . \n this program seeks to help safely relocate the teaching of laparoscopy from the lecture hall and animal laboratory to the clinical setting , and , in doing so , we hope to accelerate the training of interested , qualified urologists over the next few years . residents and fellows are being trained in laparoscopic urology now ; as a result , this fellowship may be phased out in the future ; until this noticeable lacuna in training is filled , we would wish to continue to offer this training to interested consultant urologists . \n a one - on - one fellowship program enables rapid , safe , and effective laparoscopic skills acquisition by established urologists .",
      "summary": "objectives : a fellowship training model in laparoscopic urological surgery has been established for interested urologists to help them proceed from the pelvic trainer/ animal laboratory environment to safe clinical practice . \n the objective of the model is to provide trainees with clinical experience under direct mentor supervision before embarking on independent laparoscopic urological surgery at their own base hospitals.methods:the fellowship model incorporates 9 fluid phases : phase 1 to complete basic and advanced training courses . \n phase 2 to practice at home or in the office using pelvic trainers . \n phase 3 to proceed to an animal laboratory course . \n phase 4 to visit centers of international repute to observe high - volume laparoscopic urology . \n phase 5 to observe the mentor perform several major renal laparoscopic cases . \n phase 6 to perform several hand - assisted renal procedures under direct mentor guidance at the mentor hospital . \n phase 7 to perform several laparoscopic or retroperitoneoscopic renal procedures , or both , under direct mentor guidance at the mentor hospital . \n phase 8 to mentor assisted trainees to start laparoscopic surgery at their own hospitals . \n phase 9 to practice laparoscopic urology independently.results:so far , 9 trainees have participated in the fellowship . \n six have reached phase 9 with independent practice , 2 others are in phase 8 , and 1 is in phase 7 . \n skills development has been steady , with progressive acquisition of surgical dexterity and spatial orientation.conclusion:this fluid fellowship model provides urologists with clinically applicable teaching experience to learn a relatively new surgical concept safely and effectively , thereby promoting clinical governance . it may be possible for other centers to establish similar fluid  mini  fellowships to help disseminate laparoscopic surgical skills .",

Mike Honda, a Democrat from San Jose who is facing former Obama administration official and fellow Democrat Ro Khanna in the 2014 election. The Honda campaign has been touting Obama's endorsement.\n\n\"Somebody who works tirelessly on behalf of California every day but also works on behalf of working people and makes sure that we've got a more inclusive America - a good friend of mine, somebody who you guys should be very proud of,\" Obama said of Honda.\n\nThe Atherton fundraisers benefited the Democratic National Committee and were held at the homes of Mark Heising and Liz Simons, and Marcia and John Goldman.\n\nIn his remarks, Obama highlighted the legacy he hopes to leave after his second term, saying he wanted to improve the economy for the middle class, address climate change and push for gay rights.\n\nHe also said he hopes to see immigration reform and new gun-control laws enacted, but that Americans will have to mobilize for such initiatives if the gridlocked Congress is to act.\n\nObama on Wednesday held two fundraisers in San Francisco for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, at which he emphasized his goal to return House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco to the speakership.\n\nObama left San Francisco Thursday afternoon and returned to Washington.\n\nDrew Joseph is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

      "document": "San Francisco's fire chief has explicitly banned firefighters from using helmet-mounted video cameras, after images from a battalion chief's Asiana Airlines crash recording became public and led to questions about first responders' actions leading up to a fire rig running over a survivor.\n\nChief Joanne Hayes-White said she issued the order after discovering that Battalion Chief Mark Johnson's helmet camera filmed the aftermath of the July 6 crash at San Francisco International Airport. Still images from the footage were published in The Chronicle.\n\nFilming the scene may have violated both firefighters' and victims' privacy, Hayes-White said, trumping whatever benefit came from knowing what the footage shows.\n\n\"There comes a time that privacy of the individual is paramount, of greater importance than having a video,\" Hayes-White said.\n\nCritics, including some within the department, questioned the chief's order and its timing - coming as Johnson's footage raised the possibility of Fire Department liability in the death of 16-year-old Ye Meng Yuan.\n\nThe footage shows a Fire Department rig running over the Chinese schoolgirl as she was covered with fire-retardant foam. It also makes clear that Johnson, who was in charge of the firefighting and rescue effort and was directing rig movements, had not been told that Ye was on the ground near the wreckage of the Boeing 777.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department, which is investigating Ye's death, has a copy of the footage, as does the San Mateo County coroner, who concluded that Ye was alive when she was struck. The footage is also in the hands of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is reviewing the circumstances surrounding Ye's death.\n\nHayes-White banned video cameras in \"any department facility\" in 2009. She said Friday that she realized after Johnson's footage became public that she needed to spell out that the order covered helmet cameras.\n\n\"I think it is fairly clear,\" she said. \"Without someone's permission, videos are not to be taken.\"\n\nIt is not clear how many San Francisco firefighters and paramedics have such cameras, but their use has spread in recent years. Paramedics, in particular, say having still and video images can be helpful if patients question how they were treated before arriving at a hospital.\n\nFootage shot with helmet cameras has been used as a learning device to train new firefighters, said Battalion Chief Kevin Smith, president of the employee group that includes Johnson, the Black Firefighters Association.\n\nHayes-White said Johnson \"has been interviewed\" about possibly being in violation of the 2009 policy. Johnson has referred queries about the footage to Fire Department officials.\n\nThe footage raised several questions about the handling of the firefighting and rescue efforts after the Asiana plane slammed into a seawall short of the runway at SFO, spun to a stop and caught fire. Two passengers in addition to Ye died, and 180 were injured.\n\nThe helmet-camera video shows that although Johnson took command of the effort within minutes after the crash, firefighters never told him that Ye was on the ground near the plane's left wing. Johnson arrived just as other injured crash victims were being taken to an initial triage area away from the plane.\n\nSources have said two firefighters had concluded that Ye was already dead - a determination that the coroner's autopsy found was incorrect.\n\nAs the firefighter in charge of the scene, Johnson should have been told of the girl's presence, regardless of whether she was alive or dead, veteran firefighting experts say.\n\nUnaware of Ye's presence, Johnson ordered a foam-spraying rig into the area where the girl lay obscured, the footage shows. The rig ran over Ye, killing her instantly.\n\nSmith said banning helmet cameras now was \"regressive\" and ill-timed, given the publicity over the airport crash footage.\n\n\"The department seems more concerned with exposure and liability than training and improving efficiency,\" Smith said. \"Helmet cams are the wave of the future - they can be used to improve communication at incidents between firefighters and commanders.\n\n\"The department should develop a progressive policy to use this tool in a way that is beneficial and not simply restrict its use,\" Smith said. \"We are public servants, we serve the public - why be secretive?\"\n\nAnthony Tarricone, a lawyer for Ye's family, also questioned Hayes-White's timing and motives.\n\n\"Why would anybody not want to know the truth?\" he said. \"What's wrong with knowing what happened? What's wrong with keeping people honest?\n\n\"That's what the helmet cam did, in effect, in this case,\" Tarricone said.\n\nHe said video recordings increasingly are \"critically important\" in reconstructing first responders' actions at disaster scenes, \"the same way that airplanes have cockpit voice recorders and data recorders. The idea that the Fire Department wants to prevent these cameras from being used, it's really disturbing.\"\n\nArin Pace, a lieutenant with the Jacksonville, Fla., Fire Department who also runs a company that sells helmet cameras to firefighters, said San Francisco is not the first fire department to ban the equipment. At least two other cities, Houston and Baltimore, have also done so, he said.\n\n\"Departments in general are careful about how information is handled, and for good reason,\" Pace said. \"I think a lot of them would prefer we didn't have Facebook and YouTube. For so long, they were able to feed the media what they wanted to feed them. I think a lot of them view the helmet cam thing as kind of scary.\"\n\nHe said as long as patient privacy issues are respected and firefighters are careful not to record grisly accident scenes, helmet-camera footage can help a department.\n\n\"It's good to the watch the tape - like any pro football team, they watch the tape of how they did at the last game,\" Pace said. \"It's better than a live fire exercise, because it's a real fire. It's invaluable. More departments are starting to embrace it - the trend is toward it as opposed to departments running away from it.\"\n\nPace said he understands fire officials' concerns about liability issues, but \"liability doesn't mean you can just keep things quiet and brush them under the rug.\"\n\n\"The camera doesn't lie - it just shows what happened,\" he said. \"In some cases, it shows something that isn't very flattering. In those cases, what are you going to do?\"\n\nHayes-White said the city has no control over what firefighters might do with footage they shoot while on duty, and that the Fire Department could end up being liable for violating privacy law.\n\n\"There's a lot of concern related to privacy rights and the city taping without a person being aware of it while responding to medical calls,\" the chief said. \"A lot of information is sensitive.\"\n\nJaxon Van Derbeken is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Mr. Podhoretz, a prominent neoconservative, was appointed to the post by Charles Z. Wick, director of the International Communication Agency. ''This is all part of a general effort now for the United States to be more active in the war of ideas,'' says Mr. Podhoretz. Other members of the committee include Michael Novak, the author; Bayard Rustin, the civil rights leader, and Edwin J. Feulner Jr., president of the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nT O the theater director Stephen Porter, it seems both fortuitous and ironic that the opening of a new Kennedy Center season Wednesday should start with ''The Physicists,'' the ingenious and provocative drama by Friedrich Duerrenmatt, a Swiss playwright. Fortuitous because the play, written 20 years ago, deals in part with the same antinuclear sentiment that seems to have seized Europe in recent months. Ironic, perhaps, because the play, which centers on the responsibilities and limits of science in a dangerous age, should open within sight of the Pentagon and the White House.\n\nAccording to Mr. Porter, the play, which stars Irene Worth, Brian Bedford, Len Cariou and George Grizzard, is an intriguing blend of ''farce, melodrama, tragedy, allegory.'' Mr. Porter, taking a coffee break in the midst of rehearsals, said: ''It's a very complicated psychological exercise for the actors. It's a work-out.''\n\nMr. Porter, a well-known interpreter of continental drama, said the themes of the play are revealed late in the drama, which is set in a madhouse. ''One of the themes, for me, is the feeling that scientific knowledge can lead to violence. There's no way to hold back that knowledge and it's impossible, utterly impossible to keep the release of that scientific knowledge.''\n\n''The tragedy,'' Mr. Porter observed, ''is that the greatest advances of human knowledge may lead to destruction. And the very people who love humanity may be responsible for creating the weapons to destroy it.''\n\nMr. Porter said ''it shows a kind of courage of sorts for Roger Stevens'' to open the season with a relatively controversial drama which, like the other plays to be offered in 1982, will be heavily underwritten by CBS. Mr. Stevens, chairman of the Kennedy Center, is himself a somewhat controversial figure. His choice of plays in recent years has come under attack by some Broadway producers and others in the theatrical community - plays of often-erratic quality, staid English productions that left their audiences bored.\n\nUpcoming this season is Sidney Howard's ''The Late Christopher Bean,'' with Jean Stapleton and Pat Hingle; ''Medea,'' with Zoe Caldwell and Dame Judith Anderson; Ibsen's ''Ghosts,'' with Liv Ullmann, and Moliere's ''The Imaginary Invalid,'' with Alan Arkin.\n\nMr. Porter said with a smile: ''Actually, most actors adore working here in Washington. Audiences are so responsive. They laugh a lot. Applaud a lot.''\n\nF ORGET the Polish crisis! And unemployment! And inflation! And all the other problems and events darkening the holiday season. In Washington, at least, among the press corps (or among some members of the press corps who are usually concerned about Very Important Matters), the major crisis over the past few days has been the White House Christmas party. Specifically, whether one has been invited to the Monday night party or the Tuesday night party.\n\nFor reasons not entirely clear - except that press people care about this very deeply - rumors surged around town last week that Ronald and Nancy Reagan had invited the ''A'' list of journalists tonight, and the ''B'' list last night. What followed was shock and anger among the Monday-nighters. The press office was flooded with calls, asking for Tuesday invitations. Some threatened to boycott the Monday party. Others were too ashamed to admit that they had actually been invited Monday. Friends were reluctant to ask each other which party they had been invited to.\n\nTo the amazement of the deeply troubled reporters, White House officials failed to take the crisis seriously. ''Actually, when we first heard this we laughed hysterically,'' said Barbara Cook, a press aide to Mrs. Reagan. ''It's untrue. Totally. Absolutely.''\n\nMiss Cook said the White House press office had shaped a list of 600 reporters out of 1,700 accredited to cover the President. The 600, she said, were those who most often visited the White House. List in hand, the press office then sent out invitations, alternating each name on the alphabetical list with the parties.\n\n''Honestly, these parties are the same,'' said Miss Cook. Francis X.

It has been supported by Attorney General Robert Abrams and two commission members, Rosemary S. Pooler and Anne F. Mead.\n\nLast year the commission granted a full $449.5 million revenue increase, or 15.5 percent, sought by Con Edison, and $184 million, or 13.2 percent, for Lilco.

      "summary": "Employee Free Choice Act of 2016 This bill amends the National Labor Relations Act to require the National Labor Relations Board to certify, without an election, an individual or labor organization to be the exclusive representative of the employees in a unit appropriate for bargaining if a majority of the employees has signed valid authorizations designating the individual or labor organization specified in a properly filed petition as their bargaining representative, and no other individual or labor organization is currently certified or recognized as the exclusive representative of any of the employees in the unit. The Board shall develop guidelines and procedures for the designation by employees of a bargaining representative. Whenever collective bargaining is for the purpose of establishing an initial agreement involving a newly organized or certified employee representative, the requirements for bargaining collectively shall be modified. The parties shall meet to bargain collectively within 10 days after the employer receives a written request. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) shall use its best efforts, by mediation and conciliation, to bring the parties to agreement if 90 days lapse without settlement of a dispute. If such efforts fail for 30 days, the FMCS shall refer the dispute to an arbitration panel, whose decision shall bind the parties for two years, unless the parties consent to a different time period.  The preliminary investigation of charges involving employer discrimination or unfair labor practices while employees of that employer were seeking representation by a labor organization shall be made forthwith and given priority over all other cases except cases of like character in the office where the charge is filed or to which it is referred. The Board shall award an employee back pay and, in addition, twice that amount as liquidated damages if it finds that the employer has discriminated against the employee either during the period while the employer's employees were seeking representation by a labor organization, or during the period from the time a labor organization was recognized as a representative until the first collective bargaining contract between the employer and the representative was entered into.  Any employer who willfully or repeatedly commits any unfair labor practice during these periods shall, in addition to any make-whole remedy ordered, be subject to a civil penalty of up to $20,000 for each violation.

appropriate esophageal dilator in place . \n port placement with the robot followed laparoscopic standards with the exception of ports being placed more distant to one another to allow broader external movements . \n in open cases , unless the patient had a previous midline scar , a left subcostal incision was performed . \n regardless of the surgical approach , once the equipment was inside the abdominal cavity , identical steps were taken to dissect the gastroesophageal junction and wrap the gastric fundus around the esophagus . \n descriptive and analytical statistics were applied to compare surgical times , length of hospitalization , and outcomes using kruskal - wallis and tukey tests for continuous data and the chi - square text for nominal data . \n in the 150 nissen cases included in this study , patients were younger and smaller in the open group ( 8555 months , 2417 kg , p<0.05 ) compared with those in the robotic ( 11764 months , 3723 kg ) and laparoscopic groups ( 10771 months , 3324 kg ) ( table 1 ) . \n the most common indication for the procedure was reflux refractory to medical management either as the sole reason or associated with failure to thrive or neurological impairment , or both of these [ r = 39(78% ) , l = 50(100% ) , o = 34(68% ) ] . \n other indications include a failed previous antireflux procedure , reflux associated with oromotor dysfunction , hiatal hernias , aspiration with an acute life - threatening event , and esophageal stricture . \n robot operative times proved significantly longer compared with times for laparoscopic and open procedures ( r 16061 min , l = 107 + 31 min , o = 7327 min , p<0.05 ) . \n the number of gastrostomy tubes done in addition to the nissen fundoplication in the robot group were similar to that of the other groups [ r = 17/50 ( 34% ) , l = 24/50 ( 48% ) , o = 11/50 ( 22% ) , p>0.05 ] . \n the robot group experienced 2 conversions to the open approach ( 2/50 4% ) , comparable to the laparoscopic conversion rate ( 1/50 2% ) . \n open cases resulted in longer hospitalization compared with the robot - assisted cases [ r = 2.944.5 d , o = 3.52.8 , p<0.05 ] . \n complication rates were equivalent between groups , including hiatal hernia , tight wrap requiring dilatation , and wound infection [ r = 7(14% ) , l = 8(16% ) , o = 5(10% ) , p=0.387 ] . the most common complication with the da vinci and laparoscopic approaches was a tight wrap , requiring dilatation [ r = 4/50 , 8% and l = 3/50 , 6% ] , whereas in the open series , wound infections were more common ( 2/50 , 4% ) . on 30-day follow - up , \n the presence of transient symptoms including dysphagia , abdominal pain , feeding aversion , and gas bloating were equivalent [ r = 15 ( 30% ) , l = 14(28% ) , o = 6(12% ) , p=0.06 ] . \n in our experience , the robot proved to be an acceptable approach for laparoscopic nissen fundoplication . \n this parallels the findings reported on early experiences from other centers . as in previous randomized trials , our experience with nissen fundoplication shows comparable efficacy of the robotic and laparoscopic approaches , with similar morbidity . the laparoscopic procedure , whether da vinci assisted or not , demonstrated a slight reduction in hospital stay compared with the open technique . \n patient demographics , surgical times , and complication rates according to surgical approach denotes significant difference between the robot vs. open group . \n of the 2 robot cases that were converted to open , one was due to intraoperative hypotension and arrhythmia and the other due to difficult dissection following failed prior repair . \n postoperatively , the presence of transient symptoms was similar between groups , reaching up to 30% . \n there was a trend towards fewer symptoms in the open group that may be due to achieving a tighter wrap in the robot and laparoscopic groups leading to more gas bloating and abdominal complaints . \n however , in long - term follow - up , all patients achieved symptomatic relief . \n the learning curve for the da vinci system played a key role in our surgical times despite previous reports . \n the 50 robotic cases in our study were distributed among the 3 surgical faculty and 4 pediatric surgery residents during this time . \n in addition to this , the robot requires several extra steps to achieve assembly in a sterile fashion and to change the instruments . \n we believe these factors combined would explain why the robot - assisted procedures resulted in both longer operative and total room times compared with the open series . \n we expect reduced surgical times once the operating surgeons overcome this 10-case learning curve and reduced setup time as well with more practice and repetition of use . therefore , like others , we have found no proven outcome benefits of using the robot in low- or medium - difficulty cases compared with the laparoscopic approach . \n potential benefits over standard laparoscopy include 3-dimensional image quality , camera steadiness , and the dexterity of the instrumentation for dissection and suturing . \n to better delineate cases that benefit most from each one of the 3 techniques , randomized prospective trials utilizing surgeons past the learning curve is required . \n robot - assisted surgery is equivalent to standard laparoscopic surgery in terms of complications and length of stay , with both having significantly increased operation times but reduced length of stay compared with open surgery . \n improved results are expected once the learning curve is overcome . however , potential outcome benefits have yet to be proven .",
      "summary": "background : robot - assisted surgery must be evaluated before its acceptance as an option for standard therapy in the pediatric population . \n our objective is a comparison of results using the robot system with results for the laparoscopic and open approaches.methods:following irb approval , robot - assisted procedures were case - matched with controls , selected from 1994 to 2005 . \n data for 150 nissen cases were divided equally into 3 groups [ robot ( r ) , laparoscopic ( l ) , and open ( o ) ] , comparing surgical times , length of hospitalization , and outcomes.results:the average age ( r = 11764 months , l = 10771 months , o = 8555 months , p<0.05 ) and weight ( r = 3723 kg , l = 3324 kg , o = 2417 kg , p<0.05 ) of the open group were lower comparatively . \n robot operative times proved significantly longer compared with laparoscopic and open time ( r = 16061 min , l = 107 + 31 min , o = 7327 min , p<0.05 ) . \n the robot had 2 conversions ( 2/50 , 4% ) , comparable to the laparoscopic conversion rate ( 1/50 , 2% ) . \n open cases resulted in longer hospitalization [ r = 2.944.5 days , l = 3.547.8 days , o = 3.52.8 , p<0.05 ] . \n complication rates were equivalent between groups . \n the most common complication with the da vinci and laparoscopic approaches was tight wrap requiring dilation [ r = 4/50 ( 8% ) and l = 3/50 ( 6%)].conclusion : robot - assisted surgery is equivalent to standard laparoscopic surgery in terms of complications and length of stay , with both having significantly increased operation times but reduced length of stay compared with open surgery . \n further experience with this technology is needed to overcome the learning curve and reduce operative times .",

old patient was referred to our unit for upper abdominal pain since two week and lost of 6 kg in two months . in his past medical history \n the serum carcinoembyonic antigen and cancer antigen 19 - 9 ( ca ) level was normal . \n transabdominal ultrasonography showed a hepatic steatosis and 5 angiomas . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showed the angiomas and a lesion of 2020 mm of the pancreatic tail with decreased signal intensity on t1-weighted mr images , increased signal intensity on t2-weighted mr images , and discreetly hypovascularized ( figure 1 ) . due to concerns of pancreatic malignancy ( pancreatic adenocarcinoma ) , \n we found a tumor about 5 cm in diameter lacking clear margins in the tail of the pancreas , which was removed via an open distal splenopancreatectomy . \n histological analysis of the resected specimen revealed no malignancy , but dense fibrosis with lymphoplasmositic infiltration and acinar atrophy ( figure 2 ) . \n postoperatively , autoantibodies and immunoglobulin were normal but igg4 was slightly above of the upper limit of the normal range . \n patient was treated by 40 mg / j of corticotherapy with a remarkable improvement . in the follow up , \n because of the past medical history of mellitus diabetes , the young age of the patient , the normalization of the serum igg4 level , the absence of malignancy in histology , and the clinical improvement after corticoid therapy , the diagnosis of aip was made . \n figure 1magnetic resonance imaging shows the affected pancreatic lesion involving tail with decreased intensity on the t1-weighted image ( a ) and increased intensity on the t2-weighted image ( b ) compared with the signal intensity in the liver . \n magnetic resonance imaging shows the affected pancreatic lesion involving tail with decreased intensity on the t1-weighted image ( a ) and increased intensity on the t2-weighted image ( b ) compared with the signal intensity in the liver . \n figure 2the histologic findings of the resected specimen of the pancreas include : dense fibrosis ( black arrow ) , lymphoplasmacytic infiltration , and acinar atrophy ( white arrow ) . \n hematoxylin and eosin ( he , 250 ) . the histologic findings of the resected specimen of the pancreas include : dense fibrosis ( black arrow ) , lymphoplasmacytic infiltration , and acinar atrophy ( white arrow ) . \n although diagnostic criteria were established for aip , there remains no practical strategy to differentiate pc from aip . \n making a correct differential diagnosis between the two conditions is of paramount importance as the treatment approaches are different . \n the common presenting symptoms of the pseudo tumoral autoimmune pancreatitis are mild abdominal pain , jaundice , and weight loss . \n cholestatis was seen in 75100% of a japanese series , mild pancreatitis , acute recurrent pancreatitis , biliary duct strictures are a various clinical forms of aip . \n it is made by radiologic computed tomography scan finding of a narrowing of the pancreatic duct and parenchymal edema of the pancreas ( a sausage shape ) . \n isolated focal pancreatic mass is difficult to be diagnosing without doubt as a focal aip . \n it can show focal aip as a low - attenuation or an iso - attenuation mass . \n on the other hand , features highly suggestive of pancreatic cancer were a pancreatic low density mass , main pancreatic duct obstruction , distal pancreatic atrophy , and metastases . \n endoscopic ultrasonography provides the opportunity for fine needle aspiration , but does not have pathognomonic findings on its own . \n immunological abnormalities include hypergammaglobulinaemia , elevated serum igg4 levels and the presence of autoantibodies including antinuclear antibody , anti smooth muscle antibody , rheumatoid factor , antilactoferrin antibody and anticarbonic anhydrase antibody ii . \n the specificity and sensitivity of a high serum igg4 level in the diagnosis of aip are > 90% . \n after resection , histological changes in aip show predominantly periductal inflammation consisting of a dense interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate , thus causing duct obstruction with acinar tissue fibrosis . \n in addition , aip has been seen in association with retroperitoneal fibrosis , kidney involvement and lung nodules . \n these features are considered as extrapancreatic signs of aip and might be helpful to diagnose especially in focal form . \n our patient had no extrapancreatics features . because of the difficulty of the diagnosis , several types of diagnosis criteria have been proposed . since there is currently no diagnostic serological marker for aip , and approach to the pancreas of histological examination is generally difficult , aip is currently diagnosed on the basis of presence of a combination of abnormalities unique to aip . for practical purposes , the revise japanese clinical diagnostic criteria ( 2006 ) and hisort criteria from the mayo clinic and in 2011 international consensus diagnostic criteria for aip were proposed . \n in this set of diagnostic criteria , the diagnosis of aip is made using one or more positive criteria on : i ) imaging criteria : diffuse enlargement of the pancreas and diffuse or segmental irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct ; ii ) laboratory criteria : elevated levels of igg and/or igg4 or the presence of autoantibodies ; iii ) histopathologic criteria : fibrosis and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration ; iv ) association with other autoimmune diseases ; and v ) response to steroid therapy . despite all these investigations procedures and the existence of these criteria , \n 35% of patients undergoing pancreatic resection for presumed pc in fact has aip , as was the case of our patient . \n reported that 7 of 37 ( 18.9% ) aip patients had surgery because they were misdiagnosed as having pc or bile duct cancer . \n this treatment may represent a diagnosis test , considered as one of the main diagnosis criteria . \n extrapancreatic features , igg4 level , endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration and corticotherapy are helpful to evoke aip . \n the preoperative diagnosis should prevent unnecessary surgery causing a high morbidity comparing to medical treatment ( corticosteroid ) of aip .",

FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The purchase of government goods and services is an \n        important means through which the government fulfills its \n        constitutional duties to provide for the common defense and \n        promote the general welfare of the United States.\n            (2) American taxpayers expect that government procurement \n        serves the interests of all Americans.\n            (3) The United States and several of its trading partners \n        are signatories to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement, \n        which holds that signatories agree to certain restraints with \n        regard to government procurement.\n            (4) However, the People's Republic of China is not a \n        signatory to the Agreement on Government Procurement, and that, \n        accordingly, it is not a violation of that agreement for the \n        Congress to establish procurement policies as best suit the \n        American public interest with regard to Chinese goods.\n            (5) China has structured its government procurement law to \n        favor its domestic goods, as noted in article 10 of such law.\n            (6) China has also recently announced a plan to favor so-\n        called ``indigenous innovation'' under which the Chinese \n        Government would expressly favor locally developed products and \n        technologies.\n            (7) American companies have had little or no success in \n        accessing Chinese Government procurement contracts, while \n        Chinese companies have had great success in selling goods for \n        United States Government projects.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--Accordingly, it shall be the policy of \nthe United States to limit the total value of Chinese goods that may be \nprocured by the United States Government during a calendar year to not \nmore than the total value of United States goods procured by the \nChinese Government if any during the preceding calendar year.\n\nSEC. 3. CERTIFICATION; PROHIBITION AND LIMITATION ON UNITED STATES \n              PROCUREMENT OF CHINESE GOODS.\n\n    (a) Certification.--Not later than March 1 of each year beginning \nin 2012, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit to Congress a \ncertification in writing that contains the following:\n            (1) A determination of whether or not the Chinese \n        Government has prohibited the procurement of United States \n        goods by the Chinese Government during the preceding calendar \n        year.\n            (2) If the Chinese Government has not prohibited the \n        procurement of United States goods by the Chinese Government \n        during the preceding calendar year, an identification of the \n        total value of United States goods procured by the Chinese \n        Government during the preceding calendar year, as determined by \n        the International Trade Administration under section 4.\n    (b) Prohibition.--If the Secretary determines and certifies to \nCongress under subsection (a)(1) that the Chinese Government has \nprohibited the procurement of United States goods by the Chinese \nGovernment during the preceding calendar year, then--\n            (1) the head of each executive agency may not award a \n        contract for the procurement of Chinese goods during the \n        succeeding calendar year; and\n            (2) the Secretary of Transportation shall prohibit a State \n        or other entity from using funds made available from the \n        Highway Trust Fund or the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for the \n        award of a contract for the procurement of Chinese goods during \n        the succeeding calendar year.\n    (c) Limitation.--\n            (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines and certifies \n        to Congress under subsection (a)(1) that the Chinese Government \n        has not prohibited the procurement of United States goods by \n        the Chinese Government during the preceding calendar year, then \n        the total value of Chinese goods that may be procured by the \n        United States Government during the succeeding calendar year \n        may not exceed the total value of United States goods procured \n        by the Chinese Government during the preceding calendar year, \n        as identified under subsection (a)(2).\n            (2) Rule of construction.--For purposes of determining the \n        total value of Chinese goods that may be procured by the United \n        States Government during a calendar year under paragraph (1), \n        the total value of Chinese goods procured by a State or other \n        entity using funds made available from the Highway Trust Fund \n        or the Airport and Airway Trust Fund during the preceding \n        calendar year shall be deemed to be Chinese goods procured by \n        the United States Government.\n\nSEC. 4.

      "document": "a 17-year - old girl presented with painless swelling of the right neck and supraclavicular lymph nodes accompanied with fever and fatigue in february 2007 . \n the pathology report after lymph node biopsy indicated that the normal lymph node structure had disappeared and scattered distributions of reed -

barr virus ( ebv ) , and negative for cd15 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( alk ) . \n treatment with 4 cycles of abvd was conducted as induction chemotherapy followed by bilateral neck and supraclavicular radiation therapy ( 36 gy ) . \n the patient achieved complete remission ( cr ) but , after about 1 year , relapsed with inguinal and mediastinal lymph node involvement , as detected by positron emission tomography ( pet)/computed tomography ( ct ) scan . \n afterwards , 8 cycles of salvage chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide , vindesine , epirubicin , and prednisone ( chop ) were performed , and the patient achieved cr again . \n a pet / ct scan in april 2010 indicated relapse , with mediastinal , left axillary , retroperitoneal , pelvic cavity , and inguinal lymph node involvement and multiple nodules at the thoracolumbar vertebrae , right iliac crest , and right ischium . \n the patient was diagnosed with hl of nodular sclerosis subtype after a left inguinal lymph node biopsy . \n she then underwent 2 cycles of salvage chemotherapy with rituximab , cyclophosphamide , vindesine , epirubicin , prednisone , and etoposide ( r - chope ) and underwent asct in december 2010 . \n a pet / ct scan in june 2011 subsequently demonstrated relapse once more , with nodules in the liver , spleen , and lung ( figure 2a ) . \n consequently , 2 cycles of salvage chemotherapy with gemcitabine , dexamethasone and nedaplatin ( gdp ) were given , but the disease persisted at the end of therapy . \n on october 20th , 2011 , results of ct scan showed that the number and size of nodules in the lung significantly increased ( figure 2b ) . \n the patient exhibited persistent fever and systemic failure , and showed an eastern cancer oncology group ( ecog ) score of 3 . in october 2011 , \n the patient began brentuximab monotherapy , with a dose of 1.8 mg / kg , once every 3 weeks . \n following the first course of brentuximab , the patient 's body temperature dropped gradually after 4 days of treatment and returned to normal 1 week later . because of bone marrow involvement , white blood cell , hemoglobin , and platelet counts decreased markedly before treatment . \n however , the patient continued with brentuximab therapy without interruption under the support of granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( g - csf ) , thrombopoietin ( tpo ) , and interleukin-11 ( il-11 ) . following the first course of brentuximab \n , ct scan showed that the lung nodules were significantly reduced in size and number ( figure 2c ) . \n after the second treatment , the patient began to recover from pancytopenia and regain physical strength , and her condition improved significantly . after the third course of treatment , the patient was capable of self - care , indicating an ecog score of 2 . \n pet / ct scan suggested partial remission ( pr ) . after the fourth course of treatment , anemia began to improve , with hemoglobin increasing from 60 to 100 g / l . \n after physical activity palpitations disappeared , the patient 's heart rate fell from 110130 to 7080 beats / min . \n shrinkage was noted in multiple nodular shadows in double lung fields ( figure 2d ) . \n after the sixth course of treatment , hemoglobin count had nearly returned to normal , and lesions in the lungs , liver , spleen , bones , mediastinum , and abdomen significantly decreased . \n a pet / ct scan showed that the lung nodules had disappeared , and the maximum standard uptake values ( suvmax ) of thoracolumbar vertebral nodules and liver and spleen nodules had decreased to normal ( figure 3 ) . \n the patient encountered reversible adverse reactions during treatment , including peripheral neuropathy , elevated aminotransferases , hair loss , and dry cough , and these adverse effects were controlled with symptomatic treatments . at the time this paper was submitted \n tissue specimens were collected after lymph node biopsy , sectioned , and stained to detect cd30 and pax5 . \n a , reed -

drug conjugate which consists of the anti - cd30 monoclonal antibody cac10 conjugated with the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin e ( mmae ) . as a monoclonal antibody \n moreover , chemotherapeutic drugs can also be coupled to the monoclonal antibody to directly target tumor cells , resulting in more specific and effective anti - tumor action . \n this new drug has shown dramatic efficacy on a number of relapsed and refractory hl patients . \n our data showed that brentuximab 's efficacy on this refractory and relapsed case appeared quickly . \n further , after 6 courses of brentuximab , all lesions disappeared and cr was achieved . \n adverse effects including peripheral neuropathy , elevated aminotransferases , hair loss , and dry cough appeared but could be controlled with symptomatic treatments .",

called secretory pituitary adenomas , but most are clinically inactive.3 classically , the nonsecretory tumors present with vision loss,4 whereas patients with secretory tumors are usually referred to ophthalmologists for evaluation due to hormonal imbalances that affect bodily functions.5 in patients with long -

resolution , t1 weighted , gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.10 other secretory tumors may secrete corticotropin , growth hormone , gonadotropins , or thyroid - stimulating hormone.11 adenomas remain confined to the pituitary gland , but when a pituitary adenoma is 10 mm it is called a macroadenoma . \n macroadenomas can compress the rest of the pituitary gland and surrounding structures , such as the crossing retinal ganglion cell axons in the optic chiasm , resulting in bitemporal visual field loss.4 as the tumor enlarges , it has been shown to induce uncrossed axons loss , resulting in nasal field defects and reduced visual acuity . in these cases , there is atrophy of the nasal and temporal portions of the optic disc with relative sparing of the superior and inferior parts where the majority of temporal fibers enter . \n the optic atrophy occupies a horizontal band across the disc , called bowtie or band atrophy.12,13 oct is a noninvasive technique that allows cross - sectional imaging of the retina and quantifies the thickness of the rnfl around the optic nerve head . \n a number of studies have demonstrated that oct is able to identify rnfl loss in eyes with band atrophy of the optic nerve.6,7 the degree of rnfl thickness reduction has been shown to correlate with that of visual field defects using goldmann perimetry4 and automated static perimetry.14,15 this fact gives oct prognostic value regarding the visual outcome , as demonstrated in different studies.16,17 oct is a useful tool to assess the structural and functional damage of ganglion cells , objectively and quantitatively.4 in our case the sd - oct demonstrates a symmetrical loss of the rnfl and the ganglion cell layer in both eyes , indicating important optic nerve damage . \n sd - oct can help in the diagnosis of adenomas in equivocal situations in which there is only subtle optic nerve pallor in the setting of nonspecific visual complaints or visual field defects , or when patients are referred to screen for subclinical compressive optic neuropathies .",

DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) First Declaration of Policy.--\n            (1) Need for comprehensive regional security plan.--\n        Congress declares that it is critical that a comprehensive \n        security plan is developed for Iraq and the region that accepts \n        the necessity for a deliberate redeployment of United States \n        forces from Iraq.\n            (2) Supporting details.--\n                    (A) A comprehensive security plan is necessary for \n                both the safety of United States forces in Iraq and the \n                overall national security of the United States.\n                    (B) Redeployment would allow large numbers of \n                members of the United States Armed Forces to return to \n                the United States, while some forces could be deployed \n                to areas, such as Afghanistan, where terrorists pose a \n                threat to the national security of the United States or \n                could remain at existing bases in Kuwait, Bahrain, the \n                United Arab Emirates, or Qatar and on aircraft carrier \n                and amphibious groups, to protect United States \n                interests in the region.\n    (b) Second Declaration of Policy.--\n            (1) Iraqi assumption of responsibility.--Congress declares \n        that a planned end to United States involvement in Iraq will \n        serve to force Iraqi leaders to assume responsibility for the \n        security and governance of their country while providing Iran \n        and Syria the incentive to prevent violence otherwise caused by \n        the redeployment of United States forces.\n            (2) Supporting details.--\n                    (A) The United States intelligence community has \n                found that Iran and Syria, currently involved \n                destructively in the fighting in Iraq want stability in \n                Iraq following redeployment, and can play a \n                constructive role in improving security and stability \n                in Iraq.\n                    (B) Because the redeployment of United States may \n                take up to 20 months, there is an opportunity for a \n                strategic approach to work diplomatically for political \n                accommodation in Iraq with Iran and Syria (as well as \n                Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region) during \n                that timeframe.\n    (c) Third Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that while a \n``date certain'' deadline for the redeployment of United States forces \ncould force Iraqi leaders to assume responsibility and provide Iran and \nSyria the incentive to prevent violence that could result from the \nredeployment, a ``goal'' for the redeployment's end instead of a ``date \ncertain'' is a necessary compromise in order to ensure a strategic \napproach for United States security and create a greater level of Iraqi \nstability in the aftermath of the redeployment.\n\nSEC. 4. REDEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Redeployment Required.--\n            (1) Requirement.--Redeployment of United States Armed \n        Forces serving in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom shall \n        begin within three months after the date of the enactment of \n        this Act. Within six months after the date of the enactment of \n        this Act, troop levels shall be at least 15,000 below the pre-\n        surge level of 130,000 troops.\n            (2) Goal.--Except as provided in subsection (b), not later \n        than twenty months after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n        the goal is that all United States Armed Forces serving in Iraq \n        as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom shall be deployed outside of \n        Iraq, to locations within the Middle East or Southwest Asia \n        regions or to other regions or nations, or returned to the \n        United States.\n            (3) Purpose and pace of redeployment.--The redeployment \n        required by this subsection shall be carried out for the \n        purposes of both enhancing global security interests of the \n        United States and improving the military readiness of the \n        United States. The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the \n        redeployment is carried out at a deliberate, orderly pace that \n        allows for the full security of members of the Armed Services.\n    (b) Exceptions to Redeployment Requirement.--The redeployment \nrequired by subsection (a) shall not apply to the following:\n            (1) Special operations forces and counter-terrorism \n        operations.--Special operations forces assigned outside of Iraq \n        that conduct either targeted counter-terrorism operations or \n        periodic support operations of the Iraqi security forces in \n        Iraq.\n            (2) Military liaison teams.--Military or civilian personnel \n        on military liaison teams involved in military-to-military \n        contacts and comparable activities between the United States \n        and Iraq, as authorized under section 168 of title 10, United \n        States Code.\n            (3) Air support.--Members of the Air Force, Navy, and \n        Marine Corps assigned to locations outside Iraq for purposes of \n        conducting air operations in Iraq (including air operations in \n        support of combat operations) to support the Iraqi security \n        forces.\n            (4) Security for united states diplomatic missions in \n        iraq.--Members of the Armed Forces providing security for the \n        United States Embassy and other United States diplomatic \n        missions in Iraq.\n            (5) Defense attache.--Personnel conducting routine \n        functions of the Office of Defense Attache.\n\nSEC. 5. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS.\n\n    Effective six months after the date of the enactment of this Act, \nfunds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of \nDefense under any provision of law for Operation Iraqi Freedom may not \nbe obligated or expended to support more than 115,000 members of the \nUnited States Armed Forces within Iraq, with a goal of no funding for \ntroops in Iraq within twenty months after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 6. DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    (a) United States Leadership.--The United States should take a \nleadership role in diplomatic efforts and negotiations necessary for \ncountries in the region, including Iran and Syria, to work together to \nensure the long-term stability of Iraq, which is in the best interests \nof such countries and the United States.\n    (b) International Conference.--The United States should convene an \ninternational conference to bring together countries throughout the \nworld to provide economic aid for rebuilding the infrastructure of Iraq \nand other reconstruction efforts in Iraq that are essential to ensure \nthe long-term stability of Iraq and America's national security.",

most of these are managed entirely in the outpatient setting [ 13 , 14 ] . \n minor infections are usually managed on outpatient basis while complicated wounds require readmission with the possibility of surgical interference . \n this is usually accompanied by delay in wound healing and consecutively delays of the start of postoperative adjuvant therapy . \n most of our patients who developed ssi were readmitted for management of their complicated infections ( including reoperation ) adding extra cost on the healthcare settings and may worsen the patient outcome . \n we believe that the rate of ssi in our study may be higher than we reported . \n as the postoperative length of stay is decreasing , the follow up of the patient is mainly carried out on an outpatient basis . during outpatient visits , \n when the ssi develops and requires no readmission , surgeons may not document the infection in the patient 's records and may not request microbiological sampling of the wound . \n this is primarily due to fear of medical malpractice claims or negligence especially in a surgery classified as a \n one like breast surgery . in the present investigation , despite the fact that s. aureus ( mssa and mrsa ) was the primary pathogen isolated from ssis , gram negative bacteria were isolated in 40% of cases representing a significant finding . \n however , mukhtar et al .   reported gram negative bacteria as the most common isolated pathogens . \n these findings support the importance of the use of empirical broad - spectrum antimicrobial ( not only targeting s. aureus ) coverage ( if any ) until culture results become available . \n ",

      "document": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Gunfire rang out in the mall food court, instantly transforming a casual afternoon of holiday shopping into a nightmare. The shooter, armed with a rifle, was dressed in dark clothing and wore a hockey-style face mask.\n\nAs panicked shoppers fled for cover, workers ushered some into hiding places within stores, or helped them to the exits. The first officers to arrive formed groups and rushed into the chaos, rather than waiting for the more heavily armed SWAT team.\n\n\"If we would have run out, we would have ran right into it,\" said Kaelynn Keelin, who saw a window get shot out and, along with other Made In Oregon co-workers, pulled customers into the store for shelter.\n\nThe quick mobilization of mall workers and police reflects the reality that, while mass shootings are rare, they have forced authorities to rehearse for such outbreaks of violence as if they are the norm.\n\n\"This could have been much, much worse,\" Clackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts said.\n\nRoughly 10,000 people were inside the Clackamas Town Center on Tuesday afternoon, when police say Jacob Tyler Roberts, 22, armed himself with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle he stole from someone he knew, and went on a rampage that left two people dead.\n\nThe sheriff said the rifle jammed during the attack, but the shooter managed to get it working again. He later shot himself. The sheriff and Roberts are not related.\n\nAs authorities tried to determine a motive for a shooting they said had no specific targets, details emerged about Roberts from acquaintances and neighbors. They described him as relaxed, friendly and outgoing.\n\n\"Jake was never the violent type,\" Roberts' ex-girlfriend, Hannah Patricia Sansburn, told ABC News. \"His main goal was to make you laugh, smile, make you feel comfortable. You can't reconcile the differences. I hate him for what he did, but I can't hate the person I knew because it was nothing like the person who would go into a mall and go on a rampage.\"\n\nSansburn said Roberts had recently quit his job at a gyro shop in Portland and sold all of his belongings, telling her that he was moving to Hawaii. He was supposed to take a flight Saturday but told her he got drunk and missed it.\n\n\"And then this happens. ... It makes me think, was he even planning on going to Hawaii?\" Sansburn said.\n\nSansburn did not return phone messages left by The Associated Press, and no one answered the door at her home Wednesday.\n\nA former neighbor of Roberts said that he liked to play video games and never seemed troubled.\n\n\"He was like a rapper. He would rap all the time,\" said Samantha Bennett, who said she went to middle school with Roberts but wasn't close to him until he moved in with a girlfriend across the hall from her at an apartment complex in summer 2011.\n\nHis dining room was decorated like a jungle, Bennett said, with vines on the walls and a monkey. He once showed her a black handgun that she believed he purchased legally. He dropped out of sight earlier this year, and his phone was disconnected, she said.\n\nOn a Facebook page that a friend identified as Roberts', a few photos show Roberts hanging out with friends, while the cover photo is of a wall painted with the message \"Follow Your Dreams\" with the word \"Canceled\" stamped across the message.\n\nIn the public portion of his page, Roberts wrote, \"I may be young but I have lived one crazy life so far.\"\n\n\"I'm the kind of person that is going to do what I want,\" he wrote. \"There is no reason for another person to tell you what to do, I'm the conductor of my choo choo train.\"\n\nHe added he was \"a bit of an adrenaline junkie\" who is \"just looking to meet new people and see the world.\"\n\nRoberts rented a basement room in a modest, single-story Portland home and hadn't lived there long, said a neighbor, Bobbi Bates. She said she saw him leave at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday wearing a dark jacket and jeans, carrying a guitar case.\n\nRoberts had several fully loaded magazines when he arrived at the mall, the sheriff said. He parked his 1996 green Volkswagen Jetta in front of the second-floor entrance to Macy's and walked through the store into the mall and began firing randomly in the food court.\n\nHe fatally shot Steven Mathew Forsyth, 45, and Cindy Ann Yuille, 54, the sheriff said. Kristina Shevchenko, 15, was wounded and in serious condition Wednesday, police said.\n\nOn average, there are about 20 mass murders every year, and the trend has been steady since the 1970s, said James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University in Boston and author of five books on mass murder.\n\nThe typical mass murderer is a socially isolated white man in his 30s or 40s. He has no criminal record, but his life has been marked by failure and frustration, and he decides that his family, boss or co-workers must pay with their lives, Fox said.\n\n\"The rarest form of mass murder is the completely random shooting,\" Fox said. \"Those perpetrators tend to be younger (in their 20s). They are more likely to have profound mental health issues, as opposed to the older guy who is quite sane, knows exactly what he is doing, and just decides that life is miserable.\"\n\nThe random shooter, Fox said, feels \"the whole world is unfair, someone has to pay, and it doesn't matter who.\"\n\nAmid Tuesday's gunfire, employees helped shoppers get into backrooms.\n\n\"Basically, in a situation like this it's either stay right where you're at and lock yourself down, or get to the nearest exit,\" said Dennis Curtis, the mall's senior general manager.\n\n\"We've done drills with the sheriff's office,\" including one earlier this year, he said.\n\nThe first 911 call came at 3:29 p.m. Tuesday, and officers arrived a minute later. Instead of waiting for SWAT teams, police immediately entered the crowded mall.\n\nPolice told people inside to put their hands in the air, to make sure an armed person was not among them. Police spent hours clearing the 1.4-million-square-foot mall, as some workers and shoppers continued to hide in fear.\n\nRoberts fled along a mall corridor and into a back hallway, down stairs and into a corner where police found him dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot, authorities said.\n\nFamilies of the victims released brief statements through the sheriff's office.\n\nRelatives of Yuille described her as \"everybody's friend\" and a caring person. Forsyth was a loving husband, business owner and a youth sports coach, his family said.\n\nAs for Shevchenko, it was her second brush with death this year. In August, a man veered his car into the opposite lane and crashed head-on into a van she was in.\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press writers Jonathan J. Cooper, Nigel Duara, Anne M. Peterson, Tim Fought and Sarah Skidmore in Portland, Jeff Barnard in Grants Pass, Ore., Michelle Price in Phoenix, Pete Yost in Washington and Manuel Valdes in Seattle, and researcher Rhonda Shafner.",

Yet the Federal Government spends only about one-tenth as much, they said, in relevant basic agricultural research as it does in health-related studies. They estimated that the total Federal support of basic gene-splicing research related to agriculture was currently $6 million a year.\n\nThe two concerns, the Policy Research Corporation of Chicago and the Chicago Group Inc., made the results of their survey public yesterday at a briefing. Growth Predicted for Market\n\nThe survey was made from November 1980 to January 1981, according to the presidents of the two concerns, Lester Teichner of the Chicago Group and Dr. James R. Murray of Policy Research. The groups, which have had Government agencies, health-related organizations and industrial concerns as clients, said that the gene-splicing study was done as a joint venture without outside support.\n\nThe consulting concerns have published the details of their report in a 457-page volume entitled ''An Assessment of the Global Potential of Genetic Engineering in the Agribusiness Sector,'' which will be sold for $1,250 per copy.\n\nThe concerns' spokesmen said that the worldwide market resulting from the application of gene-splicing technology to agriculture might be as large as $50 billion to $100 billion a year by the end of the century, while estimates for the market from medical and pharmaceutical applications of gene-splicing have been in the $5 billion to $10 billion range.\n\nThe field of research and development known technically as recombinant DNA technology is sometimes described as genetic engineering, or gene-splicing, because it depends on selective transfer of genes from one type of organism to another to give the recipient desirable new characteristics. Among its therapeutic benefits, the technology has begun to result in the production of human hormones in large quantity.\n\nDiscussing the potential of the field at the seminar yesterday, Dr. Richard Meagher of the University of Georgia said that the first agricultural products of gene-splicing were likely to be available in three to five years. He said the first of these would probably be a single crop plant that has been genetically altered to make it resistant to a particular herbicide so that it can be grown in the presence of the herbicide.",

Bernie Sanders, among the most liberal of Democrats vying for the party's nomination, said Sunday he doesn't have a specific number in mind when it comes to how many Syrian refugees the United States should accept.\n\nHis comments come a week after a fellow Democratic challenger, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, said the U.S. should accept at least 65,000 refugees next year. O'Malley's call echoes that of the International Rescue Committee, which has said the current U.S. commitment to accept an estimated 8,000-10,000 refugees is just a first step.\n\n\"I think it's impossible to give a proper number until we understand the dimensions of the problem,\" Sanders said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nSanders added, \"People are leaving Iraq, they're leaving Syria, with just the clothes on their backs. The world has got to respond. The United States should be part of the response.\"\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton has said the U.S. must help refugees but also has been reluctant to offer a number as to how many refugees the country should accept. A majority of GOP White House hopefuls have offered similar assessments.\n\nMany European nations, such as Germany, have committed to accepting as many as 800,000 refugees fleeing Syria's ongoing civil war.",

There was a recent published report, denied by the State Department, that the President, after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands on April 2, overruled Mr. Haig when he urged severing contact with Argentina, recalling the American Ambassador to Buenos Aires and directing Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the United States representative to the United Nations, not to attend a dinner that night at the Argentine mission.\n\nAbout the same time, a White House official, who insisted on anonymity for obvious reasons, told a reporter that Mr. Haig had twice interrupted the President's recent budget summit on Capitol Hill with calls to report on developments in the Falkland crisis.\n\nAsked what was going on, the official replied: ''Nothing was going on.

Five veterans of the hardcover bestseller list have just been published in softcover and are described in New and Noteworthy (page 43). Three other veterans are due in the racks within the next fortnight: - ''Rage of Angels'' by Sidney Sheldon (Warner). - ''The Real War'' by Richard M. Nixon (Warner). - ''Thy Neighbor's Wife'' by Gay Talese (Dell).\n\n* With three cartoon books about cats now on the trade-paperback best-seller list, you'd suppose that both ailurophiles and ailurophobes would be sated. The publishers don't think so. Yet another feline book is meowing for attention: ''101 Uses for a Dead Cat'' by Simon Bond (Clarkson Potter, $2.95), a volume of comically macabre suggestions for turning your cat into something useful - a pencil sharpener, for example - after he's exhausted his nine lives.\n\n* Nobody was more surprised and pleased by the selection of ''A Confederacy of Dunces'' as the 1981 Pulitzer Prize fiction winner than the folks at Grove Press. They've been fervent fans of John Kennedy Toole's posthumous comic novel ever since they bought reprint rights from page proofs shown them by the Louisiana State University Press more than a year ago. They sent hardcover copies to the wholesalers as soon as they came off the press in the hope of spreading the faith. They had hoped that the novel would win a prize or two, but the Pulitzer was beyond their dreams. They've already ordered a second printing. Total to date: 545,000 copies.\n\n* Several Texans have written to deny the correctness of a name listed in John Train's ''Remarkable Names of Remarkable People'' (Clarkson Potter), which we quoted in a recent issue. An obituary of ''Ima Hogg, 93, philanthropist and founder of the Houston Symphony,'' printed in The New York Times, Aug. 21, 1975, throws light on the matter: ''She was the only daughter of Texas Governor James Stephen Hogg, although there have been many references over the years to another child to whom the name Ura was given.''

You could always edit what kind of news and events you will be interested in, so there will be no Spam about the things you do not want know about. Now you could just walk out of your house, go on your phone and find out what is happening right now at the venues nearby and where your friends are at, so no excuse to be sitting at home anymore because there is nowhere to go and nothing to do. San Francisco will be the first city to test the app, which is perfect because no one is as technologically spoiled as the locals.\n\nP.S. Dear iOS 6 Map users: we feel your pain, so this could also be a good solution while your map looks like the apocalypse already occurred and Apple has the first images of the world after it.",
