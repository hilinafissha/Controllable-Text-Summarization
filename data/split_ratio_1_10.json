      "document": "the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( hiv / aids ) is in its third decade and has reached to alarming proportions worldwide . according to the centers for disease control and prevention , more than one million people are living with hiv with an estimated 56,300 infections happening each year in the united states . \n men who have sex with men ( msm ) population account for more than half ( 53% ) of all the new hiv infections , and blacks represent almost half ( 46% ) of people living with hiv in the united states.1 most of the hiv - related research is targeted towards high - risk groups such as prostitutes , gays and substance abusers but there is evidence that it is increasing in college students and adolescents as well.23 in 33 states with confidential name - based hiv reporting , of the 17,824 persons 13 - 24 years of age , 62% were males and 38% were females.2 an early step in preventive hiv counseling is behavioral risk assessment especially among high risk individuals in resource - limited settings.4 psychosocial stabilization as a means of coping among hiv infected individuals can not be overemphasized . \n besides the trained hiv counselors , family physicians , who are trained in psychosocial and community medicine , are equally poised to meet this demand.5 patient - provider relationships , when it comes to hiv positive patients , are ironically constrained as risk - reduction counseling falls woefully short of required percentage.6 si - milarly , counseling for hiv positive individuals who are on treatment for maintaining treatment adherence is quite poor.7 some of the barriers may be providercentric , such as dealing with emotional issues surrounding hiv and doubtfulness of providing good care.8 these barriers faced by counselors need to be addressed by techniques such as interactive counseling , motivational interviewing and application of stages of change.9 the usa preventive services task force made a recommendation few years back of counseling all adolescents and adults about risk reduction after they have been advised about risk factors for hiv infection and sexually transmitted diseases,10 and sexual history taking.11 some of the risk factors for engaging in unsafe sexual activities among the college students are use of alcohol,12 partner characteristics such as age,13 and substance abuse.14 the determinants of safer sex in adult population vary from whether they are hiv positive males , hiv positive females , gay or a bisexual population . \n the risk factors in a study which looked at hiv positive gays and bisexuals were mainly unprotected anal sex , which has a higher risk of hiv transmission . some of the strategies tried in this population were problem solving exercises that attempt to increase perceived benefits of safer sex . \n counselors also made the participants aware of alternative to regular use of male condoms.15 the reason for engaging in unsafe sexual practices especially in this gay population was pleasure seeking . \n some of the barriers for attaining safer sex are inaccurate risk perception , and gender inequalities , like women being powerless to negotiate their sexual safety.16 risk perception can be improved by using social interactions . \n social network formation which includes spousal communication related to aids risk has been proven to improve diffusion of behavioral change through the society.17 protection from getting hiv / aids consists of abstinence , consistent and correct condom usage and having just one sexual partner ( monogamy ) . \n several studies have found that pregnancy prevention rather than disease prevention was the impetus for condom use.1819 health education in the form of information about pregnancy prevention can unintentionally increase condom use . \n it was found that nigerian undergraduates , who had very good knowledge about hiv / aids , had low condom use to prevent its transmission.19 further evidence of knowledge - behavior gap comes from a study , which used a random sample survey of students in which the level of student knowledge was very high but did not lead to protective condom behaviors . \n however , knowledge was found to be an enabling factor in maintaining a comfort level when asking partners about their sexual histories and in requesting their partners to take an aids test.20 in a pilot project , which looked at the effect of hiv / aids prevention related messages in improving protective behaviors among indonesian participants , it was found that those exposed to the intervention were significantly more likely to use condoms to avoid aids . \n they also felt that these messages had a great impact on them to a point of wanting to change their lifestyle.21 this study did not show conclusively that there was actual behavior change on part of the participants . \n this helps to conclude that hiv / aids education related programs are not enough for generating a behavior change and can help in awareness of the disease to certain extent . \n furthermore , from the point of view of clarifying risk perception , one needs to provide counseling which includes risk reduction or harm reduction as its integral part . \n the purpose of this review is to address a number of counseling strategies used for education and counseling of individuals at risk of getting hiv / aids . \n moreover , later in this paper are discussed some of the counseling strategies used in individuals already diagnosed with hiv or aids and these strategies were used in preventing further transmission of the disease . \n in order to collect materials for this review , a detailed search of cinahl , medline , eric , academic search premier , scopus , web of science , and social sciences citation index databases was carried out for the time period 1995 -

      "document": "sphingosine 1-phosphate ( s1p ) is a biologically active lysophospholipid which is produced by the metabolism of sphingolipid catalyzed by sphingosine kinase . \n s1p is involved in various cell activities including cell differentiation , apoptosis , proliferation , migration , and others . \n the roles of s1p have recently drawn attention as s1p has been discovered to be a critical regulator of bone metabolism by many studies . \n first , s1p is released from osteoclasts and facilitates the proliferation , migration , and survival of osteoblasts by working as a coupling factor between osteoblasts and osteoclasts.[2 - 4 ] second , s1p mediates bone destruction by inducing the formation of osteoclasts . \n third , s1p is more abundant in circulating blood than bone marrow cavity.[6 - 8 ] when the difference of s1p levels between those two increases , osteoclast precursors are limitedly present in bone marrow cavity , promoting bone resorption.[9 - 12 ] however , the role of s1p in humans and the relative importance of three mechanisms mentioned in the above have not been clarified yet . in relation to this , the authors of this study have recently reported that bone resorption is promoted and bone mineral density ( bmd ) decreases as plasma s1p levels become higher in the human body . \n these previous findings imply that s1p is not only important to humans but also , involved in two mechanisms facilitating bone resorption by directly promoting bone resorption and maintaining constant concentration difference between circulation system and bone marrow cavity . \n in addition , the findings suggest that one of the bone resorption mechanisms is more important than the other and the bone formation - related mechanism . \n this investigation is a preliminary study investigating if which mechanism is more significantly involved between two bone resorption mechanisms . \n the study aims to identify the differences in s1p levels by collecting bone marrow in patients who underwent surgeries due to osteoporotic fractures and causes with other than osteoporotic fractures . \n this study involved 16 patients who underwent hip surgery in the department of orthopedic surgery , asan medical center from july 2012 to september 2012 . \n we excluded patients who took osteoporosis medications affecting bone metabolism for six months , and patients with diseases that develop secondary osteoporosis including hyperthyroidism and others . \n osteoporotic hip fracture excluded high -

values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant in all statistical analysis . \n three patients ( 75% ) were females among 4 patients with osteoporotic hip fracture ( table 1 ) . among 12 patients who underwent operation due to causes other than osteoporotic hip fracture , 7 patients were osteoarthritis , 4 patients were avascular necrosis ( avn ) of the femoral head , and a patient was hip dislocation . \n there were a male ( 25.0% ) and three female ( 75.0% ) patients with osteoporotic hip fractures . \n mean age was 64.99.8 years , showing younger mean age ( p=0.607 ) , and bmi was 25.13.9 kg / m , showing a higher tendency ( p=0.050 ) . \n the average bone marrow s1p level of all subjects was found to be 3.401.10 mol / l ( range : 2.08 - 5.74 \n we compared bone marrow s1p levels of two groups according to the presence of osteoporotic hip fractures ( fig . \n bone marrow s1p levels were 2.480.38 mol / l in patient group with osteoporotic hip fracture , and 3.701.09 mol / l in control group . \n bone marrow s1p level was significantly low in patients with osteoporotic hip fracture ( p=0.047 ) ( fig . \n bone marrow s1p levels were 2.311.94 mol / l in patient group with osteoporotic hip fracture and 3.761.10 mol / l in control group , showing significance ( p=0.025 ) ( fig . \n when we analyzed the correlation between bone marrow s1p level and bmd , statistically significant correlation was not observed after the adjustment of several confounding factors ( =0.026 - 0.482 , p=0.171 - 0.944 ) ( table 2 ) . \n this study identified that the bone marrow s1p levels were significantly lower in patients with osteoporotic hip fractures than in those without . \n no studies have been performed to verify the association between the presence of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture by clinically measuring s1p levels in the bone marrow of humans . \n the investigation is the first study to observe the positive effects on bone metabolism of high s1p levels in bone marrow , contradicting previous in vivo studies that suggested that s1p directly increases osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption . in a recent study \n , the authors have verified that bmds decrease and bone resorption markers increase as plasma s1p levels become higher in all patients including men , and pre- and postmenopausal women . \n in contrast , this investigation found the reduction in the prevalence of osteoporotic fracture as bone marrow s1p levels increase . \n thus , the risk of fracture may increase as s1p levels rise in peripheral blood . \n however , the risk of fracture may be reduced when bone marrow s1p level is higher . to sum up the above study results , s1p level is not directly involved in bone cells , instead bone resorption is accelerated as the concentration difference of s1p between peripheral blood and bone marrow cavity increases , supporting the hypothesis . \n high plasma s1p concentration is maintained as s1p is consistently released by vascular endothelial cells , red blood cells ( rbcs ) , platelet , and others . on the other hand , concentration difference between plasma and tissue is formed by maintaining low s1p levels with constant breakdown catalyzed by intracellular s1p lyase or s1p phosphatase in each tissue including bone marrow . the s1p receptor type 2 ( s1pr2 ) expression of osteoclast precursors is dominant in peripheral blood with high s1p level , and it promotes the migration of osteoclast precursors to bone marrow by triggering the signaling pathways of g12/13-mediated rho activation . once osteoclast precursors migrate into bone marrow , they are differentiated to osteoclasts . \n therefore , the migration of osteoclast precursors to bone surface is accelerated as the difference of s1p level between peripheral blood and bone marrow is higher , leading to higher risk of fracture due to increased bone resorption . \n this study failed to demonstrate significant association between bone marrow s1p levels and bmd values . \n however , the study involved a relatively small number of subjects , measuring bmds only in 14 patients . \n taking this fact into consideration , the results could not be interpreted that s1p is not taking a crucial role in bone metabolism . \n there is also limitation in generalizing the study results obtained from small sample size of 16 patients . \n furthermore , the concentration difference between peripheral blood and bone marrow is more critical factor involved in osteoclast migration rather than s1p present in bone marrow . \n however , the study was unable to measure s1p levels in the blood of same patient . \n therefore , this investigation is considered as a preliminary study suggesting the conduction of clinical trials in the future . \n this study verified that bone marrow s1p level was lower in patient group with osteoporotic hip fractures compared with control group . \n these suggest that the difference of s1p levels between peripheral blood and bone marrow is critical on bone metabolism .",

And if that's not enough to make you feel things, she introduced the song by describing its inspiration: her ill-fated relationship with One Direction's Harry Styles.\n\n\"The number one feeling I felt in the relationship was anxiety, because it felt very fragile. It felt very tentative,\" said Swift. \"It always felt like, okay, what's the next road block? What's the next thing that's gonna deter this? How long do we have before this turns into an awful mess and we break up? Is it a month? Is it three days?\"\n\nBut TayTay concedes in the end that, even with all the drama, their love was perfect in its own way.",

Thermicon heat wave hair removal system ($250, Sephora.com) is one of the newer ways to get smooth results at home.\n\nThe Fourth of July is around the corner and it's time to deal with it, girls.\n\nAnd from waxes to lasers, there are tons of options for nixing hair. Not all of them are pretty, but you will be afterward.\n\nAccording to Lucky magazine beauty editor Jean Godfrey-June, laser treatments are emerging as the experts' favorite for removing hair from all areas, providing the best results with the least amount of pain.\n\nBut with lasers, Godfrey-June warns, if you use Retin-A, antibiotics or have a fake or real tan, you could end up burning your skin. Laser treatments work by searching out the color pigment in the hair, and if your skin has these pigments from tanners or Retin-A, the laser will target the skin instead.\n\n\"If you're pale and have dark hair, you are an ideal candidate for laser removal,\" says Godfrey-June. \"In this case, blonds don't have more fun, because the lasers have a hard time finding the hair.\"\n\nAnd in recent years, it has become possible to laser right from home.\n\n\"The TRIA is an at-home laser remover and it's expensive, but a course of six treatments at a salon is over $1,000. If you're going the laser route, it's a great option,\" Godfrey-June says.\n\nAnother popular choice at Lucky, and an efficient way to remove hair, is waxing. But cautious preparation is necessary, as there will be the same burn effect if you are tanned or use Retin-A.\n\n\"I knew a girl who waxed her lip who used Retin-A and it absolutely took off her skin. She had a scar above her lip for a couple of months,\" Godfrey-June adds.\n\nIf you're squeamish about the pain, she suggests taking an aspirin or Tylenol an hour before.\n\n\"It's a personal thing in terms of what hurts and what you're comfortable with,\" says Godfrey-June. \"I know people who think lasers are hideously painful. I tried waxing once, and I was like, 'I have had natural childbirth and I am never doing this again.'\"\n\nFor those who would rather go totally unfussy and shave, Godfrey-June has tips for getting the closest shave and avoiding ingrown hairs.\n\n\"Exfoliate a bit before. This will sort of lift up hair. Then shave in the direction your hair grows first and then back up,\" she explains.\n\nThere have even been improvements in the depilatories. Godfrey-June says that now most are less smelly and messy than they were a few years ago. Veet and Nair are two popular, efficient brands.\n\nCheck out Lucky's July issue for more tips.",

      "document": "patients with conditions such as psoriasis , eczema , and skin cancer frequently face psychologic challenges which , in turn , impact their social functioning and the kind of life that they lead . \n patients may experience fearful anticipation of interaction with others , even when symptoms are not present , and develop avoidance - coping mechanisms . \n this may prevent them from partaking fully , or at all , in social and recreational activities or employment . \n ultimately , visible symptoms may change how patients see themselves and how they perceive their future . \n multiple studies reveal consistently poorer quality of life and psychosocial functioning scores among patients with visible dermatologic skin conditions compared with those who do not have such conditions [ 25 ] . \n the incidence of psychosocial comorbidities among such patients is high , as evidenced by a study which found that the risks of depression , anxiety , and suicidality attributable to psoriasis were 11.8 , 8.1 , and 0.4 per 1000 person  years , respectively ( table  1 ) .table  1the attributable risk of psoriasis for diagnosis with depression , anxiety , and suicidality mild psoriasissevere psoriasisall psoriasisdepression  attributable risk per 1000 person - years11.525.511.8anxiety  attributable risk per 1000 person - years8.08.18.1suicidality  attributable risk per 1000 person - years0.40.40.4reproduced with permission from arch dermatol . \n all rights reserved \n adjusted for age and sex \n  the attributable risk of psoriasis for diagnosis with depression , anxiety , and suicidality   reproduced with permission from arch dermatol \n all rights reserved \n adjusted for age and sex the dermatologist can play an important role in helping patients to overcome such substantial challenges and improve their overall quality of life . \n we discuss several important considerations and propose strategies to assist dermatologists in addressing the important psychosocial side of treatment in patients with visible skin conditions . \n studies have shown that successful treatment , which improves the patient s symptoms and changes their physical appearance , can lead to improvement in psychologic symptoms and a better quality of life [ 2 , 6 ] . however , \n it is important to note that , sometimes , greater life satisfaction is achieved by accepting that perhaps some symptoms will remain or recur , even if a patient generally responds well to treatment . \n such acceptance involves acknowledging the existence of symptoms , but frees up the patient to pursue a meaningful life that is not overly limited by their condition . \n it is also crucial that patients are provided with the tools to accept their remaining symptoms and to reduce the impact of these on everyday life . \n as a clinician , one is familiar with the broad spectrum of available treatment options and the tools used to objectively measure outcomes in a clinical and/or academic setting . \n treatment may be deemed successful if improvements in physical symptoms are in line with the results one would typically observe in other patients , or those that have been reported in clinical trials . \n however , it is important to remember that other factors may influence the patient s own perception of treatment success . \n patients have their own preferences and priorities regarding what treatment outcomes are more important to them . \n for example , one patient may favor reduction or elimination of signs of disease that are visible to others when wearing typical clothes ( which may change with the season ) , whereas another patient may be more interested in reducing their level of physical discomfort . \n patients satisfaction is strongly influenced by their initial expectations and the changes they were expecting to see , as well as those of their family and friends ; objective measures of symptom improvement may be less important to them . therefore , when evaluating treatment options , it is important to consider asking the patient what outcomes are most important to them and to discuss what it is reasonably possible to achieve . \n as such , a broad outcome measure that includes psychosocial and overall quality of life measures , in addition to symptom remission , would be of particular value . \n , clinicians may wish to discuss expected outcomes before treatment is initiated , including the degree of symptom improvement that can realistically be expected , the likelihood of success , and the timescales involved . \n this would ideally be a two - way conversation , in which the clinician could ask the patient to explain their hopes and expectations as a result of their treatment . \n there are several ways in which realistic expectations ( i.e. not too high and not too low ) will result in the best outcome for the patient . \n if expectations are sufficiently high , a patient is more likely to be willing to initiate treatment and remain compliant , as they will be confident that they will eventually see an improvement in their symptoms . \n similarly , if they have a tempered understanding of the expected degree of improvement , and when this may occur , they will be more likely to adhere to treatment without getting discouraged by seemingly poor results . \n this is especially important in the case of complicated regimens , such as those associated with frequent or inconvenient drug administration , those that involve some degree of pain or discomfort , or those in which extensive treatment is required before symptoms begin to improve . \n secondly , appropriate expectations can help a patient and their family to know when they need to return to the clinician and ask for a different treatment approach . \n such a dynamic , interactive relationship between the clinician and the patient can ensure that the patient s needs are being met wherever possible , and may reduce unnecessary time and costs associated with treatment that is inappropriate or ineffective for that person . finally , focusing on the broad improvement of patient quality of life , and not just on the management of visible symptoms , may help to reduce the often excessive pressure placed on healthcare providers by patients with unrealistic expectations for improvement . \n this can improve the clinician 's own sense of job satisfaction , as well as the overall relationship between the clinician and the patient . \n impairment , however , is defined as the suffering that can be caused by symptoms , and may be physical , psychologic , and/or social . \n the degree of impairment caused by a given symptom is often different in different people ; in fact , a patient can have a severe symptom but not be impaired by it at all . \n conversely , a different patient may be greatly impaired by symptoms of relatively mild severity , with a tremendously negative impact on their life . \n for example , an insecure teenager may feel extremely self - conscious about minor acne and avoid some social situations , whereas a confident young adult with much worse symptoms may hardly think about them . \n when it comes to reducing the psychologic impact of a dermatologic condition and improving the patient s quality of life , it is crucial that we address impairment and not just symptoms . \n it is possible for a patient to actively refuse to be unnecessarily limited by their symptoms , rather than be passively resigned to them . \n however , support and encouragement are often needed in order for a patient to achieve this . as clinicians \n , we have the opportunity to encourage patients to live  a big life , i.e. a life that is fulfilling , rewarding , meaningful , and interesting , and that has a positive impact on the world , in which the person accomplishes most of what they set out to do . in turn \n , the patient may strive to be the person that they want to be , regardless of their health status . \n other professionals , such as nurses , psychotherapists , or counsellors , who may be involved in the wider healthcare circle of a patient , can also assist in this regard . in some cases , an overly negative response to symptoms \n can be indicative of low self - esteem , anxiety , or depression , which can warrant a referral to a mental health professional to help the patient cope , not only with their dermatologic condition , but also with other matters . \n we can help patients to redefine themselves by asking the question ,  what would / could you do if you did not have these symptoms ? \n it should be emphasized that , although symptoms may affect how a patient lives their life , symptoms do not necessarily need to rule a patient s life . \n we can also help patients to understand that tolerating discomfort may allow them to pursue more interesting goals in life . \n mental health professionals can help more limited patients to learn better coping methods to deal with sometimes debilitating discomfort . \n patients should , of course , be encouraged to follow the treatment regimen , and active engagement with the clinician will enable the patient to feel that they are in control of their condition and their treatment program . \n however , we can emphasize to patients that it is important not to wait for complete symptom remission before pursuing a fulfilled life . \n some patients restrict their social engagement because they feel self - conscious about their visible symptoms and do not know how to respond to people s questions about them , such as why they look that way , or whether the condition is contagious . \n helping patients find the right words to explain their visible symptoms to others can help them feel more comfortable going out into the world . \n this is particularly true of situations in which the patient is likely to encounter people who are more likely to make inappropriate comments , ask personal questions , or make incorrect assumptions , such as that the condition is highly infectious . \n it is easier for the patient to cope and feel confident in such situations if they have an appropriate and informed range of responses prepared in advance . \n patients can choose to share personal information , but they also have the right not to do so . \n visible medical conditions such as psoriasis , eczema , and skin cancer often have a substantial psychologic and social impact on patients . \n however , through appropriate discussion and interaction with a patient , the dermatologist can play an important role in helping to reduce this impact , potentially improving the patient s overall quality of life . \n it is important to discuss expected outcomes before treatment is initiated , in order to ensure that realistic expectations are in place . it may also be beneficial to discuss whether total symptom relief is a necessary component to living a better life . in addition , \n helping patients to find the right words to explain their visible symptoms to others can help them feel less self - conscious and more confident in a public setting . helping patients to come to terms with their condition , and helping them to build the skills required to reduce the psychosocial impact of their condition \n , may mean that they are more equipped to go out into the world and pursue a more meaningful life . \n this article is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors .",

year follow - up found that axial symptoms ( gait and postural instability ) progress more rapidly than other motor features of pd ( tremor , bradykinesia , and rigidity ) . \n likewise , a study with a nine - year follow - up reported a greater progression of motor scores in subjects with the following characteristics : male gender , older age at diagnosis , akinetic - rigid subtype , and lower baseline motor score . a slower progression of tremor in comparison to other cardinal features of pd has also been reported . on the other hand , \n nonmotor progression has been less studied . a study derived from the adagio study population demonstrated an increase of 10% in the movement disorder society unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( mds -

up visits even when accounting for severity classification . \n conversely , all nonmotor symptom domains in the nmss scale showed an increase in the mean score , as shown in table 4 . \n an increase of 14.3  11.4 points ( 95% ic , 0.47 to 27.4 , p = 0.043 ) in nmss total score was found between visits . even though there was an increase in the score of all domains , the difference was statistically significant only for the perceptual problems and hallucinations item ( 0.2  0.7 to 0.8  2.1 , p = 0.044 ) . when analyzing by disease severity according to the mds - updrs part i score , no statistically significant increase in nmss total score within groups \n the mds - updrs part i and nmss total scores showed a high correlation ( r = 0.611 , p = 0.01 ) . \n no statistically significant associations were found between nmss scores and disease duration ( p = 0.677 ) , gender ( p = 0.964 ) , or motor phenotype ( p = 0.427 ) . \n no statistically significant changes were found in quality of life as assessed by the pdq-8 between visits . \n pd is a progressive neurodegenerative disease . rates of change in motor and nonmotor symptoms appear to progress differently in a nonlinear fashion with a greater increase in the m - edl in comparison to the nm - edl . \n traditionally , pd severity is assessed using the hoehn and yahr staging . in this regard , \n the mds - updrs severity scale was preferred instead due to the fact that the hoehn and yahr scale relies mainly on the motor state . in order to evaluate the impact of nonmotor symptoms a severity classification accounting for them was needed . \n the recently published cut - off points for pd severity levels based on the mds - updrs had the advantage of including nonmotor symptoms . in the present study , \n the overall improvement of seven points in the mds - updrs part iii can be explained by several factors . \n firstly , the study was carried out at a referral center and the initial evaluation was actually the first time the patient was seen at the clinic . as a consequence , \n it should be pointed out that although the ledd increased by 120  mg / d , the actual levodopa daily dose was slightly increased . \n the latter means that no major levodopa dosage adjustments were performed but also that antiparkinsonian drugs were added as expected . \n for instance , the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the dopamine agonist ledd was doubled . \n it also should be emphasized that motor evaluations were performed during the  on  clinical state , in contrast to an  off  state that could be a better index of the disease natural history . on the other hand , \n an increase in motor complications such as  on  time with troublesome dyskinesia and motor fluctuations assessed in the mds - updrs part iv was found . \n motor complications related to dopaminergic treatment are expected to increase with disease progression despite better motor scores . \n interestingly , no difference in m - edl ( mds - updrs part ii ) was found between visits despite the improvement in motor scales . moreover , health - related quality of life assessed by the pdq-8 also failed to show any improvement . in regard to the nm - edl , \n reported a significant worsening of nm - edl scores in the mds - updrs in the placebo group , but no change in treated patients . on the other hand , a statistically significant increase of 14% in the nmss total score was observed . even though every nmss domain had an increase in its score , only the perceptual changes and hallucinations item had a statistically significant difference . \n that is , all the nonmotor symptoms worsened , but only the cumulative effect and hallucinations reached statistical significance . \n a possible explanation may be that the worsening in individual nonmotor symptoms was not clinically significant and as a consequence proper management was not initiated . \n for instance , use of antidepressants remained the same despite the increase in the mood domain score . \n additionally , some symptoms like hallucinations can be an adverse effect of dopaminergic replacement therapy , as well as a consequence of disease progression . \n our findings oppose the study of lang et al . , which reported a greater decline in m - edl in comparison to nm - edl based on mds - updrs parts i and ii . this study had a longer follow - up period ( up to 5 years ) and only included subjects with pd in early stages . \n it is possible that discrepancy is the result of a shorter follow - up and the inclusion of subjects with varying degrees of severity . \n more important is the fact that patients in our study received the best medical treatment in comparison to untreated patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial setting . as such , our study provides a pragmatic view of the effectiveness of interventions in real - life practice . \n it should be highlighted that mds - updrs part i and nmss total scores had a high correlation coefficient , but the mds - updrs part i failed to show any statistically significant difference . \n reported a strong convergent validity between mds - updrs part i and nmss but also a lack of concordance in patients with a high burden of nonmotor symptoms . \n although it is expected that mds - updrs scores correlate with the disease duration , the patients assessed in our study had different pd durations . while this issue affects direct extrapolation , it also gives a more objective overview of daily clinical practice . \n secondly , patients had different therapeutic schemes at the initial evaluation ; thus final outcomes could be influenced by the optimization of the treatment rather than from disease progression . finally , \n as mentioned before , all scales were applied during patients '  on  clinical state in order . \n this might not reflect the natural history of the disease and therapeutic effect should be considered . on the other hand , nonmotor symptoms did not change with treatment as much as motor scores . also , nonmotor fluctuations were not assessed . in conclusion , we found a motor improvement during the 21-month follow - up accompanied by an increase in motor complications . \n studies assessing motor and nonmotor changes over time in different stages of severity are needed .",

      "document": "according to the statistical analysis of the international society of heart and lung transplantation , survival after lung transplantation systematically improves . \n 88% of recipients survive three months after operation , 79% survive for one year , and about 50 - 60% of recipients survive five years after transplantation . \n the most common indication for lung transplantation is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) ( 34% ) . \n the major early causes of death are graft failure and non - cmv infections , bronchitis obliterans syndrome ( bos ) , chronic lung rejection , and graft failure after one year . \n a 58-year - old female with hyperthyroidism , osteoporosis , and copd in the fourth stage was classified for lung transplantation in 2011 . \n additional tests demonstrated pao2 ( partial pressure of oxygen ) 61.2 mmhg , paco2 ( partial pressure of carbon dioxide ) 44 mmhg ( on oxygen therapy 2 l / min ) , fev1 ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second ) 0.44 l \n 19.7%sd , fvc ( forced vital capacity ) 1,38,8% sd , 6-mwt ( six - minute walk test ) 174 metres , rvsp ( right ventricular systolic pressure ) 36 mmhg , and pra ( panel reactive antibody ) 3% . after four months of expectation a 57-year - old female donor , who died because of cerebral haemorrhage and was ventilated for 48 hours with pao2/fio2 360 mmhg , was identified . \n both women were characterised by comparable growth and identical blood group . the day after donor identification the transplantation was performed . for this purpose \n the right pulmonary vein cuff proved to be very short and tight , so it was decided to implant the left donor lung in the recipient 's right emphysemal lung locus . \n elements of the recipient 's right lung hilum were dissected , cut distally with clamping of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins cuff . \n after preparation the left donor 's lung was implanted in the contralateral position . in conjunction with different bronchus diameters \n the donor bronchus was telescopically placed in the recipient 's bronchus and stitched with single absorbable sutures 3 - 0 . \n two drains were inserted in the pleural cavity , and closure of the thorax was carried out . \n metal suturing of the sternum and the suturing of the periosteum of the fifth rib and layered lid suture were performed ( fig . \n the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit ( icu ) , where she stayed for eight days . because of retrospectively positive cross - match it was necessary to implement five automatic plasmapheresis and to apply human immunoglobulin and rituximab to diminish concentration of lymphocytotoxic antibodies against hla antigens . on the third day after transplantation the primary graft dysfunction and rising emphysema of the recipient 's own lung shifted the mediastinum towards the graft side . as well as standard treatment , \n c1-esterase was provided to deplete the extracapillary exudation , and the operative ( lung volume reduction surgery  lvrs ) reduction of emphysemal changed lung tissue was pursued with complication of prolonged air leakage ( fig . \n the patient needed infusion of 16 units of fresh frozen plasma ( ffp ) , 2 units of packed red blood cells ( prbcs ) , and 100 ml of 20% albumin . \n the right lung drainage was removed after seven days and the left one after 35 days . \n on the 44 day after transplantation the patient was discharged from hospital with the following study results : po2 68.9 mmhg , pco2 44.0 mmhg ( without oxygen therapy ) , fev1 1.12 - 50.5% , fvc 1.38 - 52.2% , 6-mwt 246 metres , and with recommendation of taking immunosuppressing medications such as : 50 mg of cyclosporine twice a day , 1000 mg of mycophenolate mofetil twice a day , and 10 mg of prednisone once a day . \n 3 ) . it was histopathologically confirmed and antibodies against donor antigens were detected ( anti - hla class ii 158.57 - 701.89 mfi ) . on the third day the therapy with methylprednisolone was pursued . in chronically treatment instead of cyclosporine the tacrolimus of 0.5 mg a day was implemented . \n additionally , the hospitalisation was complicated by moraxella catarrhalis infection , so amoxicillin with clavulanic acid was applied . \n diagnostic tests performed meanwhile showed transient renal failure , ion disorders , hypoproteinaemia , and leukopaenia . at the turn of fifth and sixth month after transplantation \n the next complications occurred : bronchitis caused by corynebacterium pseudodiphtericum , and escherichia coli urinary tract infection , both treated with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid , and a second episode of acute graft rejection . during the next two months e. coli sepsis was seen and was treated with ceftazidime \n . then the cytomegalovirus disease treated with ganciclovir , pulmonary embolism , and anxiety disorder treated with opipramol and venlafaxine occurred . on account of leukopenia 2900/l \n after the next month the third episode of acute graft rejection appeared , following bacterial infection caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa cured with ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime and bilateral otitis with sinus and temporal bone polyposis development , hence clindamycin and budesonide inhalation were applied . \n because of hypogammaglobulinaemia it was decided to assign human immunoglobulins every three weeks . during the 11 and 12 month after the transplantation ( fig . \n 4 ) the next bacterial infections caused by acinetobacter baumanii , proteus mirabilis , candida albicans , c. glabrata and aspargillus species ensued . the therapy contained cefuroxime , imipenem , ampicillin with sulbactam , amikacin , amphotericin b , itraconazole , and colistin . \n meanwhile drug - induced diabetes with rapid decompensation occurred , which initially needed glimepiride and then insulin therapy . \n later , renal failure and a fourth episode of acute lung rejection appeared . between the 14 and 16 month after lung transplantation \n the fifth episode of rejection appeared , renal failure deepened , and destabilisation of diabetes occurred . \n the cytomegalovirus disease activated and valganciclovir was used in therapy , but the leukopaenia deteriorated and it was necessary to reduce the dose of the drug . \n in addition , acinetobacter baumani , klebsiella pneumoniae , and candida albicans infections appeared . in therapy \n the ceftazidime , ciprofloxacin , ampicillin with sulbactam , colistin , metronidazole , tazobactam , itraconazole , and nystatin were used . at this time \n unfortunately , the psychological state of the patient gradually worsened , and she manifested symptoms of depression . \n collateral complication appeared as posttraumatic haematoma of the shin , which required vac - therapy ( vacuum assisted closure  vac ) . \n 498 days after transplantation the patient died due to symptoms of sepsis after unsuccessful reanimation . \n two drains inserted in right pleural cavity and catheter in right carotid internal vein are visible chest x - ray performed after lung volume reduction surgery ( lvrs ) chest x - ray performed during first episode of acute rejection chest x - ray performed one year after transplantation \n lung transplantation in medically incurable patients is the only method that gives a chance to lengthen their lives . \n currently it is recommended that the cross - match be pursued before performing the transplantation to avoid such a situation , although there are some scientific reports discussing the primary existence of these antibodies in the recipient 's organism or their appearance as the consequence of transplanted organ dysfunction . \n there are some case reports that adduce false positive and false negative pre - transplant virtual cross - matches . \n however , virtual cross - match should be considered as a routine technique used before transplantation procedure in poland . \n virtual cross - match is the admitted method of prediction if the recipient produces hla - antibodies . \n an appropriate computer program determines every hla antigen immunogenicity that is incompatible with full recipient hla haplotype as an inconsistent immunogenic loci ( miss - match amino acids eplets  mmep ) . \n safe immunogenic incompatibility that does not result in humoral response can also be predicted with this method . \n it is a huge advantage in patients who need multiple transplantations . extending the scope of immunological selection to hla - cw , dq \n , dp increases the effectiveness of virtual cross - match ( 91% ) in comparison to serological selection on hla - a , b , dr used in poland . \n difficulties in proper donor selection are related with imperfection of chemical reagents and antibody detection techniques . in the first case \n the chance for transplantation is wasted , in the second the patient is exposed to serious postoperative complications . furthermore , the role of antibodies against the host 's own ( personal ) antigens in pathogenesis of chronic dysfunction of transplanted organs is discussed . \n however , no matter which hypothesis is accepted , only quickly implemented therapy can improve the patient 's condition . \n there are some ambiguous reports about monoclonal antibodies although there are some indications that such treatment can be effective [ 6 , 7 ] . \n we proceeded with mandatory cross - match before lung transplantation in every recipient with pra > 0% . also , \n the age of qualified donors is limited to 55 years old , whereas the criterion of pao2/fio2 was raised to > 400 mmhg . \n the recommended operation technique is bilateral lung transplantation because of the reservoir of microorganisms in the recipient 's own lung , so nowadays in such a clinical situation probably reconstruction of the donor 's right pulmonary vein cuff would be performed . \n additionally , lvrs , according to present knowledge , would not be pursued , because the shading of the graft after transplantation was caused by primary graft dysfunction and not by the recipient 's own lung . \n finally , meticulous training of the transplantation team in surgical techniques should be continued , which is achieved in our case by practicing microsurgical techniques on rats and by using a cadaver workshops . \n ",

1.0 cases per million per year . \n a majority of cases are sporadic , some cases are familial , carrying a prion protein mutation and it is usually fatal within 1 year . \n we report the significance of mri findings to correlate and support the clinical diagnosis of cjd . \n a 75 year - old lady presented with rapid cognitive decline of three months duration . \n a patient was evaluated as a case of dementia and had frontal , parietal , temporal , and occipital deficit signs on neuro - psychiatry evaluation . \n mri was done as a part of her investigation on a 1.5 t ge ( signa , usa ) scanner , which showed diffuse cortical t2 and flair hyperintensities in bilateral frontal , parietal , temporal , and occipital locations [ figures 1 and 2 ] . \n the cortical hyperintensities showed significant restriction on dwi [ figure 3 ] , giving rise to the strikingly conspicuous lesions compared to the normal cortex signal in the above locations . \n axial t2 w mr images showing faint and equivocal cortical hyperintensities ( arrows ) in bilateral frontal , parietal , and temporal lobes . \n axial flair mr images shows the signal abnormalities slightly better compared to figure 1 , although cortical hyperintensities ( arrows ) are not very striking . \n diffusion weighted mr images clearly shows increased visibility of high signal from restricted diffusion ( arrows ) in the bilateral frontal , parietal , temporal , and occipital regions along the cortical locations . \n later in the course of the disease , she developed myoclonic jerks , eeg changes which were consistent with the who criteria of probable cjd . \n according to the national cjd registry at nimhans , bangalore , india , there are only 85 recorded cases of cjd till september 2005 \n . the diagnostic triad of cjd i.e. , of a progressive dementia , myoclonus and periodic sharp wave eeg activity may not be evident in about 25% of the cases . \n mri with dw and flair sequences is an invaluable modality in supporting the diagnosis of cjd . \n shiga et al in his study concluded that diffusion - weighted mri(92% ) had higher sensitivity in the detection of cjd than flair sequences ( 41 - 59% ) , t2 ( 36 - 50% ) , eeg ( 50 - 78% ) , csf protein 14 - 3 - 3(84% ) or neuron  specific enolase ( 73% ) . \n diffusion - weighted mri is more resistant for motion artifacts than t2w and flair images . \n the abnormalities on dw - mri could be detected as early as at 3 weeks of symptom duration and even before the appearance of periodic triphasic waves on eeg . \n matoba et al noted that the hyperintensity in the basal ganglia and cortex during the early stages was more extensive and conspicuous while in the later stages there was disappearance of the abnormal signals in the cortex . \n the cause for restricted diffusion is attributed to accumulation of abnormal vacuoles in the cytoplasm and microvacuolation of neuritic process heralding spongiform degeneration . \n sporadic cjd shows t2 prolongation and restricted diffusion in the corpus striatum followed by the neocortex and posterior and medial thalami . in variant - cjd , \n the t2 hyperintensities are commonly located in the posterior ( pulvinar ) and medial thalami followed by periaqueductal grey matter , striatum , and less commonly in the neo - cortex . \n the increased signal intensity in the pulvinar relative to the anterior putamen is called the  pulvinar sign  is the most sensitive marker for variant cjd . \n the bilateral pulvinar sign has a sensitivity of 78% and correlates with the histological gliosis . \n the combination of flair and dw imaging has a sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of over 90% in differentiating cjd from other dementias . \n the multifocal cortical and subcortical hyperintensities in the grey matter showing restricted diffusion on mri may be more useful than the csf protein 14 - 3 - 3 analysis . \n 14 - 3 - 3 protein analysis was not performed because of the lack of the availability of the test at our institute . \n csf protein 14 - 3 - 3 analysis availability is limited only to a few cities and is not done routinely in all the hospitals . \n however , diagnosis can only be confirmed by histological examination of brain tissue obtained either by the brain biopsy or after autopsy . \n these are not performed by many institutions due to the transmissible nature of the disease . \n this case highlights the role of dw - mri as practical modality in the early diagnosis of cjd . \n mri radiologist can give the first clue to an unsuspected case of cjd , as in this case and can make it easy for the clinician who has to do an elaborate work - up of dementia cases . \n radiologists and neurologists should be familiar with the characteristic appearance of dw imaging as a clue to the diagnosis of this dreaded disease , for which no treatment is available till date . in a patient with rapid dementia , \n mri should be done as it is accurate , noninvasive , and cost - effective ( as compared to csf-14 - 3 - 3 analysis ) and if findings are suggestive of cjd , the clinician should be alarmed and appropriate infection control measures are to be taken .",

      "summary": "Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017 This bill amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to allow the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) to subject a bank holding company to enhanced supervision if: (1) the company has been identified as a global systemically important company; or (2) the risk of the company's financial distress, or the nature of the company's activities, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. Currently, companies are subject to this type of oversight if they possess at least $50 billion in assets or are a nonbank financial company under the FRB's supervision.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council must approve of any metrics used by the FRB in determining by regulation that a category of bank holding companies is subject to enhanced supervision. Under this bill, companies subject to enhanced supervision may be required to limit mergers and acquisitions, restrict products offered, or maintain a certain debt ratio. The FRB must publish the list of companies that have been identified as requiring enhanced supervision.",

hence , radiographic and histopathological interpretation are important to establish appropriate surgical management . \n the treatment options can include curettage with peripheral ostectomy , segmental resection and radical resections for the more aggressive lesions . \n a 17-year - old male patient visited us with a complaint of swelling in the left maxillary molar region , which enlarged to the present size within a span of 3 months . \n extraoral swelling was evident in the left side of the maxilla [ figure 1 ] . \n multilocular radiolucency extending from the distal aspect of the canine to the maxillary tuberosity region was observed on panoramic [ figure 2a ] and occlusal radiographs [ figure 2b ] . \n the computed tomographic ( ct ) scan showed swelling with bony expansion and thinning of the cortical plates with strong enhancement of the mass lesion in the anterior maxilla [ figure 3 ] . \n the microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin ( h and e)-stained section showed fine fibrillar mucoid stroma with evenly spaced spindle- and stellate - shaped cells , and a mild to moderate amount of collagen was observed [ figure 4 ] . \n the mucoid nature was confirmed with a positive reaction with alcian blue stain [ figure 5 ] , and periodic acid - schiff stain was negative . \n subsequently , the lesion was diagnosed as om and surgical resection followed by prosthetic reconstruction was proposed . swelling present in the left maxilla ( a ) orthopantomogram showing multilocular appearance in the left maxilla , ( b ) occlusal radiograph showing multilocular radiolucency extending from the distal aspect of the canine to the third molar region computed tomography scan showing the extent of the lesion hematoxylin and eosin section showing stellate - shaped cells in the fine fibrillar stroma ( 100 ) alcian blue - positive reaction ( 40 ) \n the histogenesis of om is related to the odontogenic ectomesenchyme of a developing tooth or undifferentiated mesenchymal cells in the periodontal ligament . \n the odontogenic origin has been supported by the following reasons : \n exclusive occurrence in the tooth - bearing areas of the jawsassociation with an unerupted tooth or a developmentally absent toothfrequent occurrence in young individualshistological similarity between om and pulpal ectomesenchymeoccasional presence of sparse amounts of odontogenic epitheliumits uncommon occurrence in other parts of the skeleton . \n exclusive occurrence in the tooth - bearing areas of the jaws association with an unerupted tooth or a developmentally absent tooth frequent occurrence in young individuals histological similarity between om and pulpal ectomesenchyme occasional presence of sparse amounts of odontogenic epithelium its uncommon occurrence in other parts of the skeleton . \n the majority of cases are reported in the second and third decades of life . according to kaffe \n om is usually a central lesion , and the radiographic appearance is important to establish the diagnosis . \n multilocular radiolucency with either distinct or poorly defined margins is observed in adults and in the posterior part of the jaw . \n zang et al . examined the radiographic appearances of 41 om that were divided into six types . \n multilocular ( including honeycomb , soap bubble and tennis racquet patterns ) ; type iii  involvement of local alveolar bone ; type iv  involvement of the maxillary sinus ; type v  osteolytic destruction ; and type vi  a mix of osteolytic destruction and osteogenesis . \n kaffe et al . in his radiographic study revealed an interesting correlation between size and locularity ; unilocular lesions were smaller than 4 cm and multilocular lesions were larger than 4 cm . in the present case , \n it is difficult to differentiate solid ameloblastoma , odontogenic keratocyst and om using radiographs as all these lesions exhibit multiloculation . \n dental radiographs are a bidimensional projection of a tridimensional structure , and therefore superimposition of anatomic landmarks can masquerade important findings . \n asuami et al . examined the dynamic magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) features to differentiate these lesions ; solid areas of ameloblastoma showed an earlier enhancement than the whole areas of the om . \n these results indicated that the dynamic mri features of the tumor substance of ameloblastoma differs from om . \n because of the scarcity of studies using mri , the characteristics of the om have not been established satisfactorily . \n they found that the tumor borders were generally well defined with a smooth margin both for bony and soft tissue structures . \n cortical plate continuity was lost in numerous patients and intralesional trabeculations were observed . in the present case , \n thinning and erosion of the cortical plates was present in the anterior and posterior regions of the maxilla and intralesional trabeculations were seen . \n macdonald - jankowski suggested that both ct and radiographs should be used in the investigation of an om . \n ct assesses perforation and pattern of septa while radiographs allow a better assessment of the degree of definition of the lesion 's margins with the adjacent normal bone . on gross examination \n microscopically , it is made up of loosely arranged spindle- and stellate - shaped cells , many of which have long fibrillar processes that tend to intermesh . in cases of myxofibroma , the amount of collagen in the mucoid stroma is more prominent . \n the mucoid nature was confirmed with a positive reaction with alcian blue staining and negative periodic acid - schiff staining . \n epithelial islands are not commonly observed in the myxomas of the jaws that do not play a significant role in om . \n akihiro kimura et al . reported a case of om , in which the interesting feature was the presence of  active - looking  and irregularly proliferating epithelial islands with a microcystic appearance . \n immunohistochemical positivity with ck 19 supports the odontogenic origin and high labelling index for ki-67 indicates  active epithelium ,  which has never been reported . \n oms are extensively described as case reports ; however , the invasive behavior of these lesions has not been explained . \n surgical procedures vary from currettage , enucleation , local excision and partial and total jaw resection . \n the lack of a capsule and infiltrative growth pattern is responsible for a high rate of recurrence when conservative enucleation and curettage are performed . \n boffano et al . proposed the protocol to perform conservative surgery by enucleation and curettage when lesions were smaller than 3 cm , whereas a segmental resection with immediate reconstruction is preferred in patients affected by a bigger tumor . \n resection of the jaw was planned for this patient as the lesion in the maxilla is in close relation to vital structures ; resection procedures minimize the risk of involvement of these structures and also reduce the recurrence rate . \n om and other odontogenic tumors share common features on conventional radiographs that lead to a diagnostic dilemma . in order to establish a treatment protocol ,",
      "summary": "odontogenic myxoma ( om ) is a relatively rare benign odontogenic tumor of mesenchymal origin . \n om is more common in the mandible than in the maxilla . \n it is an asymptomatic lesion that shows an infiltrative growth pattern . \n when the maxillary sinus is involved , it often fills the entire antrum . \n odontogenic tumors are uncommon in the maxillary molar area , which often leads to diagnostic dilemma as this region of the maxilla is in the vicinity of vital structures , and radiographic overlapping of structures is always present . \n we present a similar case of a 17-year - old male patient who reported with a swelling in the left maxilla that infiltrated the maxillary sinus in a short duration of time .",

      "summary": "Hire Just One Act of 2013 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow states, for a 120-day period beginning on the enactment date of this Act, to implement an employment assistance voucher program, in lieu of paying unemployment compensation directly to employees, under which an eligible individual is issued an employment assistance voucher and is hired by a participating employer who receives a subsidy from the state for the wages paid to the employee. Defines an &quot;eligible employee&quot; as an individual who has been unemployed for at least six months, who is eligible for unemployment compensation, and who is likely to exhaust such compensation.  Requires a state program issuing employment assistance vouchers to have in effect measures to recoup subsidies made to an employer if such employer has terminated more employees during the 120-day period than such employer has hired under the program.

8 - 11 mm ) long and 0.5 mm ( range ; 0.4 - 0.5 mm ) wide ( fig . \n the buccal cavity at the anterior end was characterized by one pair of cutting plates . \n two male worms showed the copulatory bursa at the posterior end , the dorsal costa of which had a deep notch . \n after the diagnosis , she was treated with packed rbc transfusion , iron supportive therapy and albendazole medication , 400 mg twice per day for two days . \n repeated tests two months after the treatment found her hemoglobin level to be 10.6 g / dl ( 12 - 16 g / dl ) and gastroduodenoscopy found normal mucosa and no n. americanus worms in her duodenum . \n the present case constitutes evidence of local transmission of hookworm infection in korea in 2007 . \n the patient had no history of overseas travel and stayed at home for long periods of time . \n the patient 's home is at an isolated remote mountainous village in uljin - gun ( county ) , gyeongsangbuk - do , and she cultivated a small dooryard farm there . \n the environment of her door - yard must have been favorable for active transmission of hookworm . \n this transmission of n. americanus may be residual of the past endemicity of hookworm in the locality . \n however , it is a surprising finding for the recent epidemiology of helminthiasis in korea because most parasitologists and physicians regard that sths were eradicated . \n the morphological characteristics of the present hookworms were clear and definite enough to identify them as n. americanus . \n most human hookworms in korea in the past have been a. duodenale , but n. americanus has also been found in remote agricultural localities in chungcheong - do or gyeongsang - do ( 6 - 8 ) . since sths , including hookworm , heavily infected throughout korea in the past , whole rural villages were endemic for the helminthes . \n uljin - gun has been also an endemic area of those helminthes , and n. americanus must have been prevalent there . \n upgrades of environmental sanitation and mass anthelminthic chemotherapy successfully eliminated sths and their associated diseases in the whole of korea ( 3 , 5 ) . \n however , the present case allows for the possibility that some remaining endemic foci of sth transmission may be scattered in remote mountainous localities . in the village where the present patient lived , ascaris or trichuris \n it is necessary to screen infection status of sths in such remote isolated villages in the mountainous zones of korea because other similar cases may live there . \n clinical findings of the present case included anemia , dyspnea , and undernourished condition , which are known to be associated with hookworm infection ( 10 ) . \n the severe anemia may have been due not only to the hookworm infection , but also to undernourishment and low hematopoietic activity due to her old age . \n the physician observed hundreds of worms on the duodenal mucosa by endoscopy but recovered only 7 of them . picking out \n in addition to endoscopy visuals , the laboratory hematological findings also suggested that the present patient was infected by at least hundreds of hookworms , because n. americanus suck less blood than a. duodenale do ( 1 , 2 ) . \n in general , infection by a few hookworms is not sufficient to induce clinical anemia . \n this fact confirmed that the anemia of the present case was caused by heavy infection of the hookworm , n. americanus . \n reviewing her medical records , it was unfortunate that her fecal specimen was not examined properly throughout her whole past medical history . \n she had visited several hospitals but no doctors had suspected hookworm anemia and her feces had not been properly checked for more than 2 yr . the present patient suffered from this disease for at least 2 yr because the possibility of hookworm anemia in this case was completely neglected by physicians . \n this is the first case of hookworm anemia in korea to be diagnosed by endoscopy . \n although most of past endemic sths have disappeared in korea , it is still necessary for physicians to be mindful of the possibility of sths .",
      "summary": "this report describes clinical and parasitological findings of an 82-yr - old female patient who lived in a local rural village and suffered from severe chronic anemia for several years . \n she was transferred to the national police hospital in seoul for management of severe dyspnea and dizziness . at admission , \n she showed symptoms or signs of severe anemia . gastroduodenoscopy observed hyperemic mucosa of the duodenum and discovered numerous moving roundworms on the mucosa . \n endoscopy isolated seven of them , which were identified as necator americanus by characteristic morphology of cutting plates in the buccal cavity . \n the patient was treated with albendazole and supportive measures for anemia , and her physical condition much improved . \n this case suggests the possibility that hookworm n. americanus is still transmitted in a remote local mountainous area in korea .",

was designed to ( i ) track severe disease within states and territories to better characterize the focal nature of the pandemic , ( ii ) track disease trends over brief periods of time to facilitate rapid public health responses to changes in ph1n1 epidemiology , and ( iii ) accommodate variation in local resources by providing a simple , flexible method that allowed reliable reporting by all states and territories without overwhelming health departments during the pandemic response . in this report \n , we describe the methods and implementation of ahdra and provide preliminary results from this new surveillance activity . \n from august 30 , 2009 , through april 6 , 2010 , cdc requested weekly reporting of influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths from all 50 us states , the district of columbia , new york city , and six us territories . \n states and territories were asked to identify hospitalizations and deaths in their jurisdictions according to either a laboratoryconfirmed or syndromic surveillance definition and could use either definition to report hospitalizations or deaths . \n polymerase chain reaction ( rtpcr ) testing , direct fluorescent antigen testing ( dfa ) , immunofluorescent antigen testing , or viral culture ; identification of influenza type or subtype was not required . \n syndromic reports included cases of pneumonia and influenza based on clinical syndrome , admission or discharge data , or a combination of data elements that could include diagnostic laboratory test results . \n prior to the first reporting period , 33 jurisdictions indicated they intended to submit laboratoryconfirmed hospitalizations , and 20 indicated they would submit syndromic hospitalizations . \n thirtysix jurisdictions intended to submit laboratoryconfirmed death reports , and 17 indicated they would submit syndromic deaths ; information describing method of reporting was unavailable for one state and four territories . \n jurisdictions were instructed to submit aggregate counts each week by age group ( 04 , 518 , 1924 , 2549 , 5064 , and 65  years ) . \n aggregate counts were used to calculate agespecific weekly and cumulative rates per 100  000 according to 2008 postcensal us population estimates . laboratoryconfirmed and \n syndromic data were analyzed for relative increase or decrease by state each week , and laboratoryconfirmed cumulative rates were used to describe the age distribution of ph1n1 influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths . owing to differences between laboratoryconfirmed and syndromic reporting definitions , we calculated two national incidence estimates of ph1n1 influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths : one extrapolating reports from laboratoryconfirmed jurisdictions to the entire country and one extrapolating reports from syndromic jurisdictions to the entire country . \n calculation of rates involving laboratoryconfirmed influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths used the populations of states reporting laboratoryconfirmed cases as a denominator ; calculations involving syndromic influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths used the populations of states reporting syndromic cases as a denominator . \n laboratoryconfirmed reports from ahdra were used to estimate weekly , age groupspecific national influenzaassociated deathtohospitalization ratios . \n these ratios were incorporated into a model used to estimate the national illness burden of influenzaassociated cases , hospitalizations and deaths during the pandemic , accounting for variation in medical careseeking , laboratory practice and detection capability , and underreporting of confirmed cases . \n all data were maintained in a database on a secure server at cdc , and all analyses were performed using microsoft excel and sas v 9.1 ( sas institute , cary , nc , usa ) . \n this activity was determined by cdc to be part of routine public health practice and was not subject to institutional review board approval for human research protections . \n the median number of jurisdictions reporting laboratoryconfirmed hospitalizations each week was 36 ( range 2938 ) , and the median number of jurisdictions reporting syndromic hospitalizations each week was 18 ( range 1219 ) . the median number of jurisdictions reporting laboratoryconfirmed deaths each week was 39 ( range 3040 ) , and the median number of jurisdictions reporting syndromic deaths each week was 14 ( range 816 ) . with the exception of 12  weeks at the beginning and end of the surveillance period , \n only two jurisdictions changed their surveillance definition during the reporting period ( one from laboratory confirmed to syndromic and one from syndromic to laboratory confirmed ) , and only two jurisdictions failed to report for more than 1  week during the reporting period . \n number of jurisdictions reporting to the aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity by surveillance definition and by week  august 30 , 2009 to april 6 , 2010 . in 27 of 36 jurisdictions reporting laboratoryconfirmed hospitalizations for \n which information was available , the median proportion of hospitals under surveillance was 100% of all hospitals within the jurisdiction ( range 18100% ) . for 16 of 18 jurisdictions using a syndromic hospitalization definition , \n the median proportion of hospitals under surveillance was 45% of all hospitals within the jurisdiction ( range 9100% ) . \n information regarding the type of diagnostic test used to identify cases was available for 24 jurisdictions reporting laboratoryconfirmed hospitalizations and 22 jurisdictions reporting laboratoryconfirmed deaths from september 8 to october 6 , 2009 . \n sixteen of 24 ( 67% ) jurisdictions employed rtpcr , viral culture , or dfa testing to identify the majority of reported hospitalizations ( at least 75% of reported cases in each jurisdiction ) , and 18 of 22 ( 82% ) jurisdictions used one of these methods to identify the majority of reported deaths . \n laboratoryconfirmed cases not identified by rtpcr , dfa , or viral culture were identified using rapid antigen testing or an unspecified diagnostic test . \n a total of 41  689 laboratoryconfirmed hospitalizations and 2096 laboratoryconfirmed deaths were reported from august 30 , 2009 , through april 6 , 2010 . \n weekly laboratoryconfirmed hospitalizations peaked at > 5000 during the last week of october 2009 and declined from that date to < 200 by the end of march 2010 ( figure  2 ) . \n weekly laboratoryconfirmed deaths peaked at nearly 200 during the same week as the laboratoryconfirmed hospitalization peak , before declining to < 20 per week by the end of march 2010 ( figure  2 ) . \n the highest laboratoryconfirmed hospitalization rate was observed in the 0 to 4yearold age group , which had a rate 2 to 3fold higher than those observed in the other age groups ( figure  3 ) . \n the majority of laboratoryconfirmed hospitalizations ( > 70% ) reported to ahdra were in patients < 50  years of age , and fewer than 10% were in patients 65  years of age or older . \n the ahdra weekly laboratoryconfirmed death rate peaked in october 2009 at 0078 and fell to < 0001 per 100  000 persons by march 2010 . \n the highest laboratoryconfirmed death rate was seen in the 5064  year old age group , and 69% of laboratoryconfirmed deaths occurred in patients between 25 and 64  years of age ( figure  3 ) . \n weekly laboratoryconfirmed and syndromic ph1n1 hospitalizations and deaths reported to the aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity  august 30 , 2009 to april 6 , 2010 .  estimated rates per 100  000 persons of laboratoryconfirmed and syndromic ph1n1 hospitalizations and deaths reported to the aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity , by age group , august 30 , 2009 to april 6 , 2010 . \n a total of 134  441 syndromic hospitalizations and 13  983 syndromic deaths were reported to ahdra . \n weekly syndromic hospitalizations peaked at nearly 7000 during the last week of october 2009 and were distributed in a pattern similar to the weekly laboratoryconfirmed hospitalization curve . \n weekly syndromic deaths peaked at 605 approximately 1  month later but did not show a pattern resembling the weekly laboratoryconfirmed death curve ( figure  2 ) . \n the highest rates of syndromic hospitalizations were reported in patients 65  years of age ( 399 per 100  000 ) , and in patients 04  years of age ( 255 per 100  000 ) . \n greater than 80% of all syndromic deaths reported were in patients 65  years of age , and fewer than 2% were in patients < 25  years of age ( figure  3 ) . \n extrapolating ahdra reports to the entire country yielded cumulative counts of hospitalizations and deaths that estimate what may have been observed had all jurisdictions reported using either a laboratoryconfirmed or syndromic surveillance definition ( table  1 ) .  observed and extrapolated * estimates of ph1n1associated hospitalizations and deaths in the united states reported to the aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity from august 30 , 2009 to april 6 , 2010 * extrapolated counts were calculated using the direct method of standardization and represent the number of hospitalizations and deaths that would have occurred in the united states if all states had used either a laboratoryconfirmed or a syndromic surveillance definition . \n laboratoryconfirmed hospitalization and death rates were calculated by dividing the number of cases by the sum of the state populations for states using a laboratoryconfirmed definition ( 207  654  216 for hospitalizations ; 245  351  708 for deaths ) . \n syndromic hospitalization and death rates were calculated by dividing the number of cases by the sum of the state populations for states using a syndromic definition ( 96  405  508 for hospitalizations ; 58  708  016 for deaths ) . \n both laboratoryconfirmed and syndromic hospitalization and death rates were then applied to the standard population ( u.s . \n census , july 2008 ; 304  059  724 ) to derive extrapolated counts . \n although the weekly laboratoryconfirmed deathtohospitalization ratio demonstrated considerable variability especially during the latter part of the surveillance period ( 3081376% ) , the cumulative ratio quickly stabilized near its mean of 502% in october 2009 and remained within 1% of this value throughout the remainder of the surveillance period ( figure  4 ) . \n the cumulative age groupspecific laboratoryconfirmed deathtohospitalization ratio was substantially lower for 0 to 18yearolds compared to older age groups and the overall ratio for all age groups ( figure  4 ) . \n weekly deathtohospitalization ratio from laboratoryconfirmed reports submitted to the aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity  august 30 , 2009 to april 3 , 2010 . \n laboratoryconfirmed data collected by ahdra helped characterize the epidemiology of ph1n1associated influenza hospitalizations and deaths in the united states , revealing a time course and illness distribution for ph1n1 that were substantially different from those seen in seasonal influenza epidemics . \n aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity laboratoryconfirmed peak hospitalizations and deaths occurred much earlier than the typical peak for seasonal influenza activity , which most often occurs during january or february each year . \n , \n  furthermore , the age distribution of laboratoryconfirmed hospitalizations reported to ahdra was markedly different from typical influenza seasons when hospitalizations are more common among persons over 65  years of age . \n , \n , \n  other recent studies corroborate this finding , showing that nearly half of all patients in the united states hospitalized with ph1n1 influenza infections were under the age of 25  years , and < 10% were over the age of 65 . \n , \n  overall , the age distribution of laboratoryconfirmed death rates determined from ahdra data was also markedly different from that seen in typical influenza seasons . \n in contrast to typical influenza seasons , when 90% of deaths occur in the elderly , \n , \n  86% of laboratoryconfirmed deaths reported to ahdra were in persons < 65  years of age , with the highest rate found in persons aged 5064  years . \n laboratoryconfirmed ahdra data were also useful in monitoring trends in the distribution of illness and age groups over time in specific jurisdictions . aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity laboratoryconfirmed data helped define the beginning and end of the 20092010 influenza season and accurately depicted the second wave of ph1n1 illness seen in the fall of 2009 ; \n  similar doublewave patterns have been seen in previous pandemics . \n , \n , \n  ahdra was also instrumental in the detection of and response to a minor third wave of ph1n1 activity in the southeast united states in early 2010 . \n ahdra reporting by state and local health departments allowed tracking of trends in severe disease with greater geographic representativeness than would have been possible with existing systems alone and informed decisionmaking at the state and national levels . \n for example , although the emerging infections program ( eip ) has conducted populationbased surveillance for laboratoryconfirmed influenzaassociated hospitalizations in the united states since 1995 , the eip network of hospitals conducts surveillance in certain counties in only 16 states . \n laboratoryconfirmed surveillance via ahdra during the pandemic was implemented in more than twice the number of states as in the eip network . \n aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity laboratoryconfirmed hospitalization and death surveillance was also consistent with data from existing influenza surveillance systems . \n emerging infections program hospitalizations peaked at approximately the same time in october 2009 as did ahdra laboratoryconfirmed reports , and the age distribution of ph1n1 hospitalizations described by the two systems was similar , with each identifying the highest rate in the 0 to 4yearold age group and a similar distribution of rates in other age groups . \n aggregate hospitalization and death reporting activity data also accurately reflected outpatient influenza illness during the pandemic . \n outpatient influenzalike illness surveillance network ( ilinet ) collects data from over 3000 healthcare providers each week on the proportion of patient visits for ili . * \n the ilinet weekly percentage peak for the 20092010 season ( 77% of all patient visits ) occurred 1  week prior to the ahdra laboratoryconfirmed and syndromic hospitalization peaks in october 2009 . \n this approximate 1week lag between ili onset and severe outcome ( hospitalization or death ) has been noted consistently during both annual influenza seasons and during pandemics . \n\n  despite its usefulness during the pandemic , ahdra \n first , jurisdictions were permitted to report according to different surveillance criteria ( e.g. , use of a laboratoryconfirmed or syndromic case definition , multiple diagnostic testing methods ) and results therefore did not measure identical outcomes . \n this disparity is evident in the age distributions of laboratoryconfirmed and syndromic hospitalization rates  although both reporting methods show similar peaks in the hospitalization rate for the youngest age group , laboratoryconfirmed rates thereafter generally decline with increasing age , while syndromic rates initially decline but then show a dramatic increase for the 65yearold age group . presumably , the difference is largely because of the relatively low specificity of a syndromic compared to a laboratoryconfirmed definition of influenza infection . \n syndromic reporting likely captures many hospitalizations associated with noninfluenza respiratory illness , which often occur with greater frequency in young children and the elderly , \n , \n , \n , \n  while laboratoryconfirmed reporting is much more likely to identify only cases of influenza illness . \n thus , it is inappropriate to make comparisons between reporting jurisdictions in ahdra without adjusting for differences in reporting methods and practices . instead , \n ahdra s best use may have been to track the progression of the epidemic within each state , a goal consistent with the original intent of the system . \n a more important consequence of the decision to allow two surveillance definitions in ahdra is the inherent limitation of using a syndromic definition to conduct national surveillance for influenzaassociated infections . \n although ahdra syndromic data were useful to track trends of disease within those jurisdictions submitting syndromic reports , they may not otherwise accurately reflect the burden or severity of influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths in the united states . \n because the proportion of syndromic respiratory hospitalizations and deaths attributable to influenza is small , \n  it is unclear whether syndromic findings in ahdra represent influenza infections or hospitalizations and deaths caused by other respiratory illnesses . \n interpretation of syndromic data was further complicated by the limited number of hospitals included in syndromic reports ( a median of 45% of all hospitals within each reporting jurisdiction ) . \n a further limitation of ahdra is that the system does not collect several potentially useful data elements , such as population denominator information and influenza type or subtype ( although > 99% of circulating influenza viruses during the surveillance period were ph1n1 ) . \n also , the additional effort required of reporting jurisdictions to conduct ahdra surveillance may be high and may exhaust state and local health department resources during a pandemic . finally , extrapolated burden estimates derived from ahdra data do not account for variations in medical careseeking , laboratory practice and detection capability , degree of underreporting of confirmed cases , and other population differences across jurisdictions . \n however , ahdra laboratoryconfirmed data were important components of modelbased estimates that do account for these sources of underestimation . \n understanding the impact of ph1n1 influenza hospitalizations and deaths was important to guide the pandemic response and will be important to inform preparedness and response plans for future public health crises . \n the ahdra was an important component of us influenza surveillance efforts during the pandemic and provided a level of geographic representativeness and timeliness for reporting of severe influenzaassociated outcomes that was not available from existing national surveillance systems . \n laboratoryconfirmed reporting in ahdra supplied valuable information to public health practitioners during the pandemic and should inform refinements to seasonal surveillance activities in the coming seasons , as well as revisions of pandemic surveillance plans . although useful in monitoring trends within jurisdictions , ahdra syndromic reports , as a measure of influenzaassociated hospitalizations and deaths , were difficult to interpret . \n these data were complicated by limited representativeness and a low specificity for detecting influenzaattributable hospitalizations and deaths among events associated with respiratory illness . using only syndromic surveillance data to monitor epidemic or \n pandemic influenza is thus not recommended , particularly in a setting like the 2009 h1n1 pandemic when elderly persons were largely immune because of prior exposures to antigenically related influenza viruses . \n  because ahdra was implemented within a few weeks time \n , the system may prove particularly useful as a prototype for a pandemic or epidemic respiratory infection surveillance system that needs to be implemented quickly and efficiently on a national scale . \n  \n the findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the cdc .",

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One in five members of the Armed Forces who were \n        wounded and evacuated from Afghanistan during the summer and \n        early fall of 2009 suffered a spinal injury, and at least 14 of \n        such members were left paralyzed or with loss of sensation.\n            (2) In Afghanistan, members of the Armed Forces routinely \n        carry up to 33 percent more than the suggested maximum weight \n        and up to nearly 75 percent of a member's own body weight--\n        routinely hefting combat gear that can exceed 120 pounds, \n        causing large numbers of spinal, back, and musculoskeletal \n        injuries and pain.\n            (3) The use of massive improvised explosive devices by \n        insurgents against heavily armed mine resistant ambush \n        protected vehicles has significantly increased the number of \n        spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain.\n            (4) Advances in both body armor protection and medical \n        treatment have drastically decreased the number of deaths among \n        deployed members of the Armed Forces, but there has been an \n        increase in the number of members with spinal, back, and \n        musculoskeletal injuries and long-term pain.\n            (5) Members of the Armed Forces returning from Iraq are \n        more likely to suffer lingering, debilitating injuries from \n        back and musculoskeletal pain than from battle wounds, \n        according to statistics compiled by the Secretary of Veterans \n        Affairs.\n            (6) Diagnoses of ruptured spinal discs, compressed discs, \n        degenerative disc disease, and myofascial pain syndrome are \n        common in members of the Armed Forces returning from \n        Afghanistan and Iraq.\n            (7) Spinal and back injuries are the most expensive \n        musculoskeletal disorder to treat.\n            (8) Certain facilities of the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs offer outstanding non-invasive technologies for \n        treating spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries as well as \n        any accompanying mental health issues.\n            (9) Traditional medical approaches to spinal, back, and \n        musculoskeletal injuries typically involve a combination of \n        long-term medication, surgery, and short-term physical therapy.\n            (10) Using non-invasive techniques to treat veterans with \n        spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries can improve the \n        health outcomes for such veterans and drastically reduce the \n        long-term costs of care for such veterans by breaking the cycle \n        of expensive surgery followed by long-term pain medication that \n        often leads to addiction, depression, anxiety, and weight gain.\n            (11) Non-invasive techniques that are not widely available \n        in medical facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n        including manual physical therapy, core strengthening and \n        stabilization therapy, water exercise therapy, group exercise \n        therapy, and pain management therapy, should be evaluated in an \n        evidence-based medicine framework to assess their \n        effectiveness.\n\nSEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE VETERANS WITH NON-INVASIVE TECHNIQUES \n              FOR SPINAL, BACK, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \nestablish a pilot program to--\n            (1) provide covered veterans with non-invasive techniques \n        to treat spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain; \n        and\n            (2) use an evidence-based medicine framework to assess the \n        effectiveness of such non-invasive techniques.\n    (b) Scope.--\n            (1) Size.--The pilot program shall include a representative \n        sample of covered veterans that is of sufficient size for the \n        Secretary to determine--\n                    (A) the effectiveness and feasibility of providing \n                veterans with non-invasive techniques to treat spinal, \n                back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain; and\n                    (B) the unique considerations that exist with \n                respect to providing such treatment--\n                            (i) to female veterans;\n                            (ii) to veterans of various ages; and\n                            (iii) to veterans located in various \n                        regions of the United States, including both \n                        urban and rural locations.\n            (2) Preference.--In selecting covered veterans to \n        participate in the pilot program, the Secretary shall give \n        preference to covered veterans who served in Operation Enduring \n        Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn.\n    (c) Administration.--In administering the pilot program, the \nSecretary shall--\n            (1) determine the type of non-invasive technique to provide \n        to a covered veteran;\n            (2) determine the effect of allowing self-referral by a \n        veteran to receive non-invasive techniques compared with \n        requiring a veteran to receive a referral from a physician for \n        non-invasive techniques; and\n            (3) ensure the use of telehealth technology to provide \n        covered veterans who reside in rural locations (as determined \n        by the Secretary) with non-invasive techniques to treat spinal, \n        back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain.\n    (d) Partnership.--\n            (1) University.--In administering the pilot program, the \n        Secretary shall seek to enter into an agreement with a \n        university affiliated with the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        to carry out the pilot program.\n            (2) Selection.--In entering into an agreement with a \n        university under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall ensure that \n        the individuals who treat covered veterans with non-invasive \n        techniques for spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries and \n        pain--\n                    (A) are trained to--\n                            (i) effectively treat such veterans; and\n                            (ii) recognize the unique experiences of \n                        such veterans, including experiences related to \n                        serving in Operation Enduring Freedom, \n                        Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn; \n                        and\n                    (B) use best practices and technologies with \n                respect to the non-invasive technique being used to \n                treat such veterans.\n    (e) Duration.--The pilot program shall begin not later than March \n1, 2011, and shall continue for two years.\n    (f) Reports.--\n            (1) Initial report.--Not later than June 1, 2012, the \n        Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of \n        the House of Representatives and the Committee on Veterans' \n        Affairs of the Senate a report on the pilot program, \n        including--\n                    (A) an analysis of the effectiveness and cost-\n                effectiveness of each non-invasive technique provided \n                under the pilot program;\n                    (B) an analysis of how the Secretary would \n                incorporate non-invasive techniques to treat spinal, \n                back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain at medical \n                facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n                    (C) the amount of cost-savings, if any, created by \n                providing veterans with non-invasive techniques to \n                treat spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries and \n                pain;\n                    (D) a comparison of the non-invasive techniques \n                provided under the pilot program with other methods \n                used by the Secretary to treat spinal, back, and \n                musculoskeletal injuries and pain; and\n                    (E) recommendations of the Secretary with respect \n                to--\n                            (i) continuing or expanding the pilot \n                        program; and\n                            (ii) any legislation or other actions to \n                        improve treating veterans with spinal, back, \n                        and musculoskeletal injuries and pain.\n            (2) Final report.--Not later than June 1, 2013, the \n        Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of \n        the House of Representatives and the Committee on Veterans' \n        Affairs of the Senate a report containing updated information \n        to the report submitted under paragraph (1).\n    (g) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) The term ``covered veteran'' means a veteran who--\n                    (A) has a service-connected spinal, back, or \n                musculoskeletal injury; or\n                    (B) is eligible for hospital care, medical \n                services, and nursing home care by virtue of section \n                1710(e)(1)(D) of title 38, United States Code.\n            (2) The term ``non-invasive techniques'' means methods of \n        treatment for spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries and \n        pain other than surgery, including--\n                    (A) manual physical therapy, core strengthening and \n                stabilization therapy, water exercise therapy, group \n                exercise therapy, and pain management therapy;\n                    (B) such methods (including recreational therapy) \n                used by the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center \n                of the Department of Veterans Affairs located in Palo \n                Alto, California, and the mindfulness based stress \n                reduction program of the Puget Sound Health Care System \n                of the Department of Veterans Affairs that the \n                Secretary determines to have been successful; and\n                    (C) such other methods not widely available in \n                medical facilities of the Department of Veterans \n                Affairs.",

      "document": "The current trajectory of democracy around the world is an issue of interest for Congress, which has contributed to U.S. democracy promotion objectives overseas. For decades, U.S. policy has broadly reflected the view that the spread of democracy around the world is favorable to U.S. interests. This report provides a regional snapshot of the political climate in Latin America and the Caribbean, based on the U.S. Department of State's description of each country's political system and selected nongovernmental (NGO) indices that measure democracy trends worldwide. For additional information on democracy in the global context, see CRS Report R45344, Global Trends in Democracy: Background, U.S. Policy, and Issues for Congress , by Michael A. Weber. For related information about democracy in Latin American and the Caribbean, see the following products: CRS In Focus IF10460, Latin America and the Caribbean: U.S. Policy Overview , by Mark P. Sullivan; CRS Report R45547, U.S. Foreign Assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean: FY2019 Appropriations , by Peter J. Meyer and Edward Y. Gracia; CRS Report 98-684, Latin America and the Caribbean: Fact Sheet on Leaders and Elections , by Carla Y. Davis-Castro; and CRS Report R45733, Combating Corruption in Latin America: Congressional Considerations , coordinated by June S. Beittel. CRS also publishes reports on specific Latin American and Caribbean countries. This report compiles information from the U.S. State Department and data from four nongovernmental (NGO) indices. For a discussion about definitions of democracy and critiques of democracy indices, see CRS Report R45344, Global Trends in Democracy: Background, U.S. Policy, and Issues for Congress , by Michael A. Weber. CRS does not endorse the methodology or accuracy of any particular democracy index. In parentheses following the country name in the tables below is the nature of the country's political system, as described in the U.S. State Department's 2018 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices . While the publication focuses broadly on human rights conditions in each country, the first sentence of each country report provides a characterization of the country's political system. This U.S. government information is included here for comparison with findings from the democracy indicators published by NGOs. Bertelsmann Stiftung, a private foundation based in Germany, has published the Bertelsmann Transformation Index (BTI) biannually since 2006. Key regional findings and country reports are available in English (BTI publishes the full regional report in German). BTI 2018 evaluates the quality of democracy, a market economy, and political management in 129 developing and transition countries. For political transformation specifically, BTI ranks countries using 18 indicators grouped into five criteria: (1) stateness, (2) political participation, (3) rule of law, (4) stability of democratic institutions, and (5) political and social integration. Based on the criteria, BTI assigns a category: democracy in consolidation, defective democracy, highly defective democracy, moderate autocracy , and hardline autocracy . In its regional report, BTI notes that since 2008, it \"has recorded a decline in the quality of democracy in Latin America\u00e2\u0080\u0094not dramatic, but continual.\" BTI evaluates all Central and South American nations. With the exception of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica, BTI does not evaluate Caribbean nations. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), based in London and New York, has offices and analysts in various countries. Since 2006, EIU has produced a democracy index that provides an annual snapshot of the state of democracy for 165 independent states and two territories. The EIU classifies countries as full democracies , flawed democracies , hybrid regimes , or authoritarian regimes based on an aggregate score of 60 indicators in five categories: (1) electoral process and pluralism, (2) civil liberties, (3) the functioning of government, (4) political participation, and (5) political culture. According to the EIU's Democracy Index 2018 , the Latin America and Caribbean region's overall score went down from 6.26 in 2017 to 6.24 in 2018 (on a 0 to 10 scale). The two countries in the region classified in 2018 as full democracies are Uruguay and, new to the group, Costa Rica. EIU's Democracy Index 2018 identified three countries in the region as authoritarian regimes: Nicaragua moved to join Venezuela and Cuba. EIU evaluates all Central and South American nations. With the exceptions of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago, EIU does not evaluate Caribbean nations. Freedom House is a U.S.-based NGO that conducts research on democracy, political freedom, and human rights worldwide. It has published Freedom in the World since 1978, and the current report covers 195 countries and 14 territories. Freedom House assigns each country 0 to 4 points on 25 indicators (10 political rights indicators and 15 civil liberties indicators) for a total of up to 100 points. The scores determine numerical ratings for political rights and civil liberties freedoms on a scale of 1 (most free) to 7 (least free). The political rights and civil liberties ratings are averaged to produce an overall status of free, partly free , or not free. Freedom House's report covering 2018 found that Nicaragua was the country with the greatest decline in the world regarding conditions for political rights and civil liberties as compared to 2017. Venezuela had the third-greatest decline; Brazil, El Salvador, and Guatemala also made the top 20 for steepest declines. The report's analysis is based on data that are detailed in full on the Freedom House web page on \"Countries,\" which ranks the state of democracy for 197 countries and 15 territories. This web page lists the top three aggregate scores in Latin America and the Caribbean: Uruguay, Barbados, and Chile; the region's lowest aggregate scores are those for Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Cuba. Freedom House evaluates democracy in all Central and South American and Caribbean nations. The Varieties of Democracy Institute (V-DEM), headquartered at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, collects democracy data through its research team in collaboration with country experts. In 2017, V-Dem published its first global report measuring the status of democracy with an index. Democracy Report 2019 includes the Liberal Democracy Index, which examines 71 indicators included in the Liberal Component Index and the Electoral Democracy Index. V-Dem groups 179 countries into four categories: liberal democracy , electoral democracy , electoral autocracy , and closed autocracy . The current report notes \"the regional average for Latin America is down to 0.51 in 2018, bringing the region back to about 1996-levels.\" V-DEM evaluates all Central and South American nations. With the exceptions of Barbados, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago, V-DEM does not evaluate Caribbean nations. Table 1 looks at Caribbean countries' global democracy rankings according to EIU's Democracy Index 2018 , Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2019 , V-Dem's Democracy Report 2019 , and Bertelsmann Stiftung's 2018 Transformation Index. Table 2 compares the same reports for Mexico and Central America, as does Table 3 for South America. Each report evaluates a different number of countries, so there are missing rankings for some countries. Countries are listed alphabetically in each table. Figure 1 shows the global rank and classification of all Central and South American and Caribbean countries according to the Political Transformation Rank, a component of the 2018 Bertelsmann Stiftung Transformation Index (BTI). Figure 2 shows the global rank and classification of Central and South American and Caribbean countries according to the EIU's Democracy Index 2018 . Figure 3 shows the aggregate scores of all Central and South American and Caribbean countries according to the Freedom House country web page for Freedom in the World 2019 . Countries receive 0 to 4 points on 25 indicators (10 political rights indicators and 15 civil liberties indicators) for a total of up to 100 points. Figure 4 shows the political rights and civil liberties scores of all Central and South American and Caribbean countries according to Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2019 . The scale used is 1-7, with 1 indicating the most free conditions and 7 the least free. Figure 5 shows the liberal democracy index rank and classification of all Central and South American and Caribbean countries according to the Varieties of Democracy Institute's Democracy Report 2019 . Table 4 provides resources for further information about democracy indicators in Central and South America and the Caribbean, although many cover other geographic areas as well.

      "document": "enterococci are pervasive and predominant inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals , found in soil , water and food ( 1 ) . for many years , they were considered as normal flora and unharmful to man ( 2 ) . however , over the last years , enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens , representing an increasingly important problem for public health ( 3 ) . \n indeed , these bacteria have a great ability to acquire resistance to some antimicrobial agents such as glycopeptides , in particular vancomycin , which are important for human therapy ( 4 ) . \n although enterococci are normally of relatively low virulence , they can transfer their antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors to other intestinal microflora and/or virulent bacteria , resulting in an increased pathogenicity ( 5 ) . \n the climbing incidence of antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp . is the result of increased use of antibiotics in human health care system and animal growth promoters ( 6 ) . \n the presence of large numbers of enterococci , in particular multidrug resistant ones , occurs commonly in vegetables , dairy and animal products ( 7 ) . \n this dilemma , in part , is because of extensive usage of antimicrobial agents in modern farm industry ( 8) . due to limited therapeutic options for treating vancomycin - resistant enterococci ( vre ) , they are considered as a major cause of concern . \n vre has been isolated from hospital sources , food animals , environment , and waste water . \n previously , we investigated more about vre from clinical samples , surface water and sewage treatment plants in iran . \n the results of our prior studies showed isolation of a high number of vre isolates from water and sewage ( 9 , 10 ) . \n in view of the lack of information about vre isolates in food samples , we studied the occurrence of vre in meat , chicken and cheese which were sold in local markets . \n thirty food samples , each 10 from chicken , meat and cheese were collected from tehran local markets from april to september 2010 . \n the samples were sealed in a plastic bag , labeled immediately and transported to a microbiology laboratory in a cold cycle . \n ten grams of each sample were suspended in 90 ml of saline and then heavily vortexed . \n the mixture was filtered using 0.45  filter membrane ( millipore , sparks , md , usa ) . \n the filters were then transferred to m - enterococcus agar ( becton dickinson and co. , sparks , md , usa ) supplemented with 4 g / ml vancomycin and incubated for 48 hours at 37c . \n colonies suspected to be enterococcus were subjected to identification tests using the following characteristics : growth and hydrolysis of bile - esculin agar , growth in the presence of 6.5% nacl , absence of catalase , presence of pyrrolidonyle arylamidase , 0.04% tellurite reduction , arabinose utilization , arginine dehydrolase activity , methyl - a - d - glucopyranoside acidification , and motility and pigmentation . species \n identifications were confirmed by pcr using specific primers ( 11 ) . minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) for vancomycin , teicoplanin and gentamicin were determined using the e test ( biodisk ab , solna , sweden ) . \n susceptibility tests to ampicillin ( 10 g ) , ciprofloxacin ( 5 g ) , gentamicin ( 120 g ) , erythromycin ( 15 g ) , tetracycline ( 30 g ) , chloramphenicol ( 30 g ) , linezolid ( 30 g ) , and quinupristin / dalfopristin ( q - d ) ( 15 g ) , ( mast diagnostics ltd . , bootle , merseyside , uk ) were performed by disc diffusion method according to the clinical laboratory standard institute ( clsi ) guidelines ( 12 ) . \n all the vre isolates were investigated for vancomycin resistance genes . for dna extraction , one isolated colony from each plate \n the mixture was centrifuged and 10 l of the supernatant was used as the dna template in the pcr mix . \n identification of van genotypes ( vana , vanb ) for each isolate of vre was performed by a separate pcr with specific primers as follows : vana , 5-catgaatagaataaaagttgcaata-3 , 5-cccctttaacgctaatacgatcaa-3 ; vanb , 5-gtgacaaaccggaggcgagga-3 , 5-ccgccatcctcctgcaaaaaa-3. the pcr assay was performed in a total volume of 25 l containing 10 mm tris - hcl ( ph = 8.3 ) , 1.5 mm mgcl2 , 0.2 mm each dntps , 0.5 u taqdna polymerase ( ht biotechnology , cambridge , uk ) , and each primer ( 40 pmol ) . \n the pcr cycle was as follows ; initial denaturation at 94c for five minutes , 30 cycles of denaturation at 94c for one minute , annealing at 54c for one minute and extension at 72c for one minute , with a final extension at 72c for 10 minutes ( 13 ) . \n the pcr was performed with an eppendorf mastercycler ( eppendorf , hauppauge , ny ) . \n all the isolated vre were typed using a high - resolution biochemical fingerprinting method , phene plate ( phplate ) system , which is specifically developed for typing of enterococci strains ( the phplate ab , stockholm , sweden ) . \n briefly , a loopful of a fresh bacterial culture was inoculated in phplate growth media containing 0.2% ( w / v ) protease peptone , 0.05% ( w / v ) yeast extract , 0.5% ( w / v ) nacl and 0.011% ( w / v ) bromothymol blue . \n the plates were then incubated at 37c and images of the plates were scanned after 16 , 24 and 48 hours using an hp scanjet 4890 scanner . \n after the final scan , the phplate software ( phpwin 4.2 ) was used to create the absorbance data ( biochemical fingerprint ) from the scanned images . \n the correlation coefficient using a pair - wise comparison of the biochemical fingerprints and clustered was determined according to the unweighted pair group method ( upgma ) with arithmetic averages . the mean similarity between the compared isolated minus 2sd was taken as the id - level of the system . \n isolates showing similarity to each other above this level were considered as identical ( common biochemical phenotypes : c - bpt ) ( 13 ) . \n thirty food samples , each 10 from chicken , meat and cheese were collected from tehran local markets from april to september 2010 . \n the samples were sealed in a plastic bag , labeled immediately and transported to a microbiology laboratory in a cold cycle . \n ten grams of each sample were suspended in 90 ml of saline and then heavily vortexed . \n the mixture was filtered using 0.45  filter membrane ( millipore , sparks , md , usa ) . \n the filters were then transferred to m -

resistant . \n conventional and molecular identification tests exhibited that all the isolates were e. faecium carrying vana . \n none of the isolates harbored vanb . using the method of clsi , all the isolates were tested for their resistance against antimicrobial agents . \n all the vre isolates were also resistant to ciprofloxacin , erythromycin and ampicillin ( 100% ) . \n almost the same antibiotic resistance was observed for gentamicin ( 95% ) , but only 5% of the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol . \n the mic of the isolates for vancomycin and teicoplanin was  256 g / ml and for gentamicin - resistant isolates it was 1024 g / ml . the results of typing with phplate system showed a diversity of di = 0.78 for the e. faecium population . \n a total of 14 types with 10 common types ( c - bpt ) constituting 66 isolates and four single types ( s - bpt ) were seen ( figure 1 ) . each common type comprised 2 - 31 strains . \n the vre from the meat samples showed 11 types comprising 35 isolates , while the chicken isolates contained only four types . \n some of the isolates collected from different food samples on different sampling occasions were found to have the same c - bpt ( table 1 ) . \n abbreviations : bpt , biochemical phenotype ; ct : common type ; and st : single type . \n according to the biochemical tests , a total of 102 isolates belonged to enterococci , 48 , 40 and 14 of which were from meat , chicken and cheese , respectively . \n antibiotic susceptibility test revealed that 35 , 27 and 8 isolates obtained from meat , chicken and cheese , respectively , were vancomycin - resistant . \n conventional and molecular identification tests exhibited that all the isolates were e. faecium carrying vana . \n using the method of clsi , all the isolates were tested for their resistance against antimicrobial agents . \n all the vre isolates were also resistant to ciprofloxacin , erythromycin and ampicillin ( 100% ) . \n almost the same antibiotic resistance was observed for gentamicin ( 95% ) , but only 5% of the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol . \n the mic of the isolates for vancomycin and teicoplanin was  256 g / ml and for gentamicin - resistant isolates it was 1024 g / ml . \n the results of typing with phplate system showed a diversity of di = 0.78 for the e. faecium population . \n a total of 14 types with 10 common types ( c - bpt ) constituting 66 isolates and four single types ( s - bpt ) were seen ( figure 1 ) . \n the vre from the meat samples showed 11 types comprising 35 isolates , while the chicken isolates contained only four types . \n some of the isolates collected from different food samples on different sampling occasions were found to have the same c - bpt ( table 1 ) . \n abbreviations : bpt , biochemical phenotype ; ct : common type ; and st : single type . \n a high rate of vana containing enterococcus isolates was detected in food samples of chicken ( 9/10 ) and meat ( 10/10 ) in this study . \n isolation of vana - containing enterococci strains in poultry and fresh slaughtered chicken samples has been reported in germany ( 14 ) . \n furthermore , high - level glycopeptide - resistant vana - type strains from supermarket - purchased chicken were detected in england ( 15 ) . \n on the other hand , absence of vre from meats was reported in studies performed in the us ( 16 , 17 ) which reflected the absence of vre isolation in animal food product . \n elimination of vre , in part , may have been resulted during the food processing . on the contrary , in european countries , \n vre have been frequently isolated from meat products , which might be due to the usage of glycopeptides avoparcin antibiotic in food animal production environments before banning this antibiotic ( 18 , 19 ) . in this study \n , we obtained similar results to the european countries which may indicate the presence of similar diets in iran . \n in contrast , in a study by giraffa and sisto , there was no evidence of vre in dairy products ( 20 ) . \n however , some years later , giraffa and colleagues in italy found that 50% of the cheeses examined were contaminated by vre ( 7 ) . \n e. faecium was the only species isolated in all the samples in our study , while in most of the studies e. faecium and e. faecalis were simultaneously isolated from food samples . \n klein et al . reported a total of 34 vre strains isolated from raw minced beef and pork and 38% of vre isolates were identified as e. faecium , 35% were e. faecalis , and the remaining isolates were from the e. faecium group ( 21 ) . \n moreover , similar results were detected in the uk in fresh and frozen chicken , 58% and 40% of which were e. faecium and e. faecalis , respectively ( 15 ) . \n antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that in the present study , the vre isolates were resistant to at least four antibiotics including gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , erythromycin and ampicillin . \n this has been confirmed by other studies which have found the prevalence of antibiotic - resistant enterococci in farm animals and their meat to be higher than 60% ( 22 , 23 ) . \n these studies showed that extensive agricultural use of glycopeptides or other antibiotics has created animal reservoir of resistant enterococcal species to antibiotics which has complicated the control of infections caused by enterococci . \n here we determined that resistance to gentamicin was very high among the animal products ( 95% ) . using the synergism between aminoglycosides and b - lactams or glycopeptides eliminated owing to high - level aminoglycoside resistance , which is of vast clinical importance ( 24 ) . \n peters and colleagues have reported a very low gentamicin resistance in food from animal origin in germany ( 25 ) . \n the difference in the reported antibiotic resistance among animal products could be due to geographical differences and the policy as well as production practices performed in these countries . \n all of our isolates were susceptible to tetracycline , in comparison with the results from peters and colleagues who found a high rate of tetracycline resistance in their strains ( 25 ) . \n the reason for the absence of resistance to tetracycline in this study may be due to the fact that tetracycline is not used as a therapeutic antimicrobial in veterinary medicine in iran . in \n consistent with another study , here we reported that the prevalence of chloramphenicol resistance was very low among e. faecium strains ( 26).we found no resistant isolate to oxazolidinone , linezolid and q - d in this study ( 25 ) . although surveillance of enterococci from food sources for resistance to linezolid has not been reported extensively ( 26 ) , there are some resistance reports to q - d in the usa , given the use of the analogue virginiamycin since 1974 ( 27 , 28 ) . \n in phplate analysis , we found that some of the c - bpt were found on different sampling occasions and food samples ( i.e. c8 , c9 ) , indicating a high prevalence of certain e. faecium c - bpt in the food . \n in addition , in another study , typing with phplate exhibited a high diversity in a large number of enterococci isolated from different sources including food samples ( 29 ) . \n on the other hand , genotyping with pulse - field gel electrophoresis profile ( pfge ) and random amplification of polymorphic dna ( rapd ) pcr revealed a marked heterogeneity in food isolates ( 30 , 31 ) . \n these results also showed that isolates with identical bpt pattern were found in different sampling occasions in the same food sample ( i.e. isolates in c10 ) , suggesting that some of the strains persisted for a period of time . in conclusion , the high prevalence of multidrug resistance among enterococci isolated from food is a serious threat to public health . to the best of our knowledge , \n there is no use of antibiotic other than human use , in animal feeding in iran . \n the data presented here , on the other hand , suggested the presence of antibiotic pressure in food animals . \n the level of antibiotics in animal product , in turn , may be due to treatment regimens used for infections in animals .",
      "summary": "background : vancomycin - resistant enterococci ( vre ) are important nosocomial pathogens and food chain has been considered as an assumed source for dissemination of vre to human.objectives:the presence of vre isolates from food samples and typing of these isolates with phene plate , a biochemical fingerprinting method , were investigated.materials and methods : thirty samples of meat , chicken and cheese were analyzed for vre during 2010 . \n antibiotic susceptibility tests and minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) were also examined . \n vre isolates were typed with the phene plate system ( phplate ) , a biochemical fingerprinting method.results:a total of 70 vre isolates were obtained and identified as enterococcus faecium by species - specific pcr . all the isolates carried vana , while none of them harbored vanb . \n the vre isolates included 35 , 27 , and 8 isolates from meat , chicken and cheese , respectively . \n typing with the phplate revealed a diversity index of 0.78 for e. faecium , containing 10 common and four single types . \n the results of antibiotic susceptibility and mic tests showed an increased resistance to ciprofloxacin , erythromycin , ampicillin and gentamicin , to which , 100% , 100% , 100% , and 95% of vre isolates were resistant , respectively . \n only 5% of the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol and the mic of the isolates for vancomycin and teicoplanin was  256 g / ml and for gentamicin - resistant isolates it was 1024 g / ml . \n conventional and molecular identification tests exhibited that all the isolates were e. faecium carrying vana . \n none of the isolates harbored vanb.conclusions:the results showed that enterococci are common contaminants in food . \n indeed , this study indicates a high prevalence of multidrug - resistant enterococci in food of animal origin in iran . \n isolating some persisting enterococcal isolates revealed that continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci from food is essential .",

      "document": "the benefits of vats include decreased postoperative pain , improved cosmetic surgical wounds , decreased morbidity , and shorter hospital stays when compared to open thoracic procedures.13 pain associated with thoracic surgery is multifactorial and involves muscular pain , neuropathic pain , pleural irritation , and referred pain . \n while patients undergoing vats have been shown to have less acute pain compared to thoracotomy,2,4,5 the development of chronic pain is similar.610 furthermore , the degree of acute post - thoracotomy pain has been shown to predict the presence and significance of chronic pain related to these procedures,6 increasing the importance of acute postoperative pain control . \n paravertebral blocks ( pvbs ) are a validated method of limiting postoperative pain for patients undergoing vats and other thoracic procedures.1117 our institution began providing ultrasound - guided pvbs for patients undergoing vats in the spring of 2011 with positive feedback from both patients and surgeons . \n unlike many published descriptions of ultrasound - guided pvb , in which the operator approaches the pvb space in - plane to the ultrasound beam with the probe held in a transverse mediolateral fashion , we utilize an  out - of - plane  approach with the ultrasound probe in a parasagittal plane combined with intermittent low - volume hydrodissection to guide needle advancement . the aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the analgesic efficacy of the preoperative pvbs provided for patients undergoing vats . \n following approval of an exemption application from the university of wisconsin health sciences institutional review board , we used a billing database to identify consecutive adult patients undergoing vats by a single thoracic surgeon at our institution between january 2011 and july 2012 . a retrospective review of these patients electronic medical records was performed . \n patients who underwent additional procedures at the time of the vats , required postoperative care and continued mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit , had chronic pain as defined as a baseline preoperative pain score of 5 or greater , were under the age of 18 , or who presented with injuries sustained as part of trauma were excluded from our analyses . \n additionally , two patients were excluded secondary to postoperative death attributed to long - standing hepatic disease and postoperative stroke attributed to the patient s history of cardiovascular disease . \n of the 78 eligible patients , 49 patients received a pvb prior to their planned surgical procedure . \n all patients on the operating room schedule during the day were considered for a nerve block . \n reasons for exclusion of patients would include hemodynamic instability , patient intubated and sedated already , coagulopathy , extreme obesity , prior back surgery , and a patient with active infection . \n the block occurred in a dedicated holding room and was performed by either a resident or a fellow , and a staff anesthesiologist assigned to the block team . \n blocks performed by residents or fellows were done under the direct supervision of a staff anesthesiologist on the regional anesthesia team . \n blocks were performed with minimal sedation using intravenous midazolam ( 12 mg ) and fentanyl ( 50100 g ) . after assisting the patient into the sitting position , ultrasound guidance in the sagittal plane \n was used to identify transverse process , costotransverse ligament , and pleura on the side of the surgery at levels appropriate based on the surgeon s proposed port and chest tube sites . \n once ultrasound visualization was adequate , the patient s skin was infiltrated with 2% lidocaine ( 13 ml ) , and a 22-gauge ( 50 mm ) or 21-gauge ( 100 mm ) uniplex nanoline regional anesthesia needle ( pajunk medizin technologie , geisingen , germany ) was inserted out - of - plane relative to the ultrasound probe . \n hydrodissection with sterile saline was used as the needle was advanced until anterior pleural deflection was visualized on ultrasound . \n bupivacaine ( 0.5% ) with 2.5 g / ml epinephrine was injected in divided doses after negative aspiration . in total , 1020 ml of bupivacaine was injected at each level , with most patients receiving 10 ml or 15 ml per level . \n total block volume from all levels was 2530 ml in most cases , although a single patient received a total of 40 ml . \n all patients received blocks at either two or three levels ranging from t34 to t67 on the side ipsilateral to the proposed procedure . using patients electronic medical records , the amount of opioids administered intraoperatively , in the postanesthesia care unit ( pacu ) , for the first 24 hours after discharge from the pacu and during the hospital stay were recorded . to facilitate comparisons , we converted all administered opioids to intravenous morphine equivalents using standard conversion factors as follows : morphine  10 , hydromorphone  1.5 , fentanyl  0.1 , and meperidine  75.18 the use of additional analgesics , including nonopioid intravenous and oral analgesics , and intraoperative incision infiltration by the surgeon were also recorded . once the patient was admitted to the floor , the patient reported numerical pain scores ranging from 0 ( least pain ) to 10 ( most pain ) that were recorded by nursing staff . \n the following patient - reported numerical pain scores were recorded or calculated using medical records : patients initial pain score on arriving to the pacu , highest pain score while in the pacu , mean pain score while in the pacu , pain score on initial assessment once the patient reached the floor , resting and dynamic pain scores at 24 hours after discharge from the pacu , and mean resting and dynamic pain scores for the first 24 hours following discharge from the pacu . mean pain scores were computed using all - nurse recorded patient - reported numerical pain scores during the respective time frame . \n pacu time was defined as the amount of time the patient was physically present in the pacu before meeting nursing discharge criteria . \n all patients undergoing vats procedures , with or without a preoperative pvb , received pain medications ordered by the surgery and anesthesia team in the perioperative period . \n intraoperative opioids were administered at the discretion of the in - room anesthesia staff based on clinical signs of inadequate analgesia such as increased heart rate and blood pressure during the procedure . \n opioids in the pacu were administered at the patient s request or based on the patient s verbal pain score at the discretion of the pacu nurses . once admitted to the floor \n , pain medications were administered at the discretion of the surgical service and floor nurses . \n the standard pain medication regimen included a hydromorphone patient controlled analgesic pump with a nurse bolus available . \n most patients were placed on scheduled oral acetaminophen unless contraindicated , and most received scheduled doses of either intravenous or oral nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug ( nsaid ) medication . \n patients who received a rescue antiemetic in either the pacu or within the first 24 hours postoperatively were considered to have postoperative nausea . \n our primary interest was whether pvbs led to improved pain scores and reduced opioid consumption . \n intergroup comparisons ( pvb vs no pvb ) were performed using the student s t - test , fisher s exact test , and mann  whitney u test for continuous , binary , and ordinal variables , respectively . an independent statistician performed statistical analysis of data . \n patients were excluded from our analysis for the following reasons : baseline pain score of > 5 either from pain related to reason for surgery or from an unrelated chronic issue ( n=17 ) , remained intubated post - operatively ( n=12 ) , presented as a multiple injury trauma ( n=4 ) , deceased on postoperative day 1 ( n=1 ) , stroke on postoperative day 0 ( n=1 ) , and had a prolonged narcotic infusion lasting into pacu as part of a total - intravenous anesthetic ( n=1 ) . \n of the 78 eligible patients , 49 received an ultrasound - guided pvb , while the remaining 29 did not . \n chart review revealed that among the patients receiving a pvb , four received a block at three levels , while the remaining 45 patients received a block at two levels . \n two three - level blocks were performed at levels t4 , 5 , and 6 , one at t1 , 3 , and 5 , and one at t2 , 3 , and 5 . \n twenty - six patients received a two - level block at levels t4 and 6 , nine at t3 and 5 , five at t5 and 7 , four at t3 and 6 , and a single patient received a block at t1 and 5 . \n the two groups ( pvb vs no pvb ) were comparable in terms of patient age , sex ( % ) , body mean index , and american society of anesthesiologists score ( table 1 ) . \n our analysis showed that all patients received as - needed intravenous opioids , frequently in the form of patient - controlled analgesia . \n all but six patients in the pvb group and five patients in the control group additionally received scheduled acetaminophen once admitted to the floor . \n results in table 2 show that mean intraoperative opioid consumption in morphine equivalents was significantly lower for patients who received preoperative pvb compared to those who did not ( p=0.001 ) . \n mean opioid consumption in the pacu and for the first 24 hours after surgery appeared to be less in the pvb group compared to controls ; however , this small difference failed to achieve statistical significance ( p=0.246 and 0.467 , respectively ) . \n mean opioid consumption for the duration of hospital stay was significantly lower in patients who received pvb ( p=0.011 ) . \n patient - reported numerical pain scores immediately upon arrival to the pacu were significantly lower in the pvb group ( p=0.005 ; table 3 ) . \n peak pain scores in the pacu ( p=0.097 ) and mean pain scores in the pacu ( p=0.061 ) were lower in the pvb group but also failed to reach statistical significance . \n pain scores on initial assessment once patients reached the floor were also significantly lower in patients receiving a pvb ( p=0.031 ) . \n both dynamic and resting pain scores at the 24-hour time point after surgery were significantly lower in the pvb group ( p=0.003 and p<0.001 , respectively ) ; however , mean dynamic and rest pain scores over this 24-hour period , while lower in the pvb group , failed to reach statistical significance ( p=0.089 and p=0.078 , respectively ) . patients who received preoperative pvb \n had a lower incidence of nausea requiring treatment both in the pacu ( 4% vs 28% , p=0.004 ) and for the first 24 hours after pacu discharge ( 8% vs 43% , p=0.001 ) compared to the control group ( table 4 ) . \n lastly , patients who received pvb spent significantly less time in the pacu before meeting discharge criteria compared to those who did not receive pvb ( 105 vs 125 minutes ; p=0.025 ) . \n we found that 40 of 49 ( 82% ) patients in the block group received scheduled postoperative acetaminophen , while 25 of 29 ( 86% ) patients who did not receive a block received scheduled acetaminophen . \n thirteen of 49 patients ( 27% ) in the block group received at least one dose of scheduled nsaid medication in the form of intravenous or oral ibuprofen , diclofenac , or ketorolac . \n six of 29 patients ( 21% ) who did not receive a block received nsaid medication . \n lastly , 24 of 49 patients ( 49% ) in the block group received intraoperative wound infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine by the surgeon , while 24 of 29 patients ( 83% ) in the control group received intraoperative local anesthetic wound infiltration . \n the findings of this study support the assertion that preoperative pvbs performed with an out - of - plane needle insertion technique improve analgesic outcomes in the immediate postoperative period and improve the quality of the anesthetic . specifically , our patients had lower reported pain scores , lower perioperative opioid requirements , fewer incidences of treated postoperative nausea or vomiting , and shorter stays in the pacu . \n all analyzed outcomes showed a trend toward improved results in patients who obtained preoperative pvb compared to those who did not . \n statistically , this fact is in itself significant and provides an objective correlation to the subjective positive feedback we have received from both surgeons and patients . \n the analgesic efficacy of pvbs in patients undergoing both video - assisted thoracoscopic procedures and open thorcatomies has been documented.1114,16,17 furthermore , the use of paravertebral catheters for postoperative pain control for thoracic procedures has also been investigated.12 classically , pvbs have been placed using landmark techniques with or without nerve stimulation , often by walking the needle off of transverse process and advancing an additional 1 cm or until the  pop  of the transverse costal ligament is felt.19 more recently , ultrasound guidance has grown in popularity with several different techniques being used for block placement , most commonly placing the ultrasound probe in the transverse plane with injection of local anesthetic using an in - plane technique.20,21 other ultrasound - guided techniques with out - of - plane needle placement rely on contact with the transverse process or loss of resistance to saline injection once the transverse costal ligament is passed to ensure block placement in the paravertebral space.22 the results of the present study demonstrate that using an out - of - plane ultrasound - guided method of single - injection pvb placement , we were able to improve our anesthetic via improved pain scores , less postoperative nausea , and less recovery time in the pacu . \n one limitation of the current study is a lack of documented dermatomal sensory blockade after block placement . \n it is not our practice to check sensory levels following placement of these blocks , and therefore , the rate of epidural spread and block failure is unknown . \n in addition , the retrospective nature of this study and the bias that was introduced due to the unblinded nature of this study introduces bias . \n providers may have expected less pain in the block patients , and therefore , gave less medication . despite these issues \n , these data do provide further evidence of the analgesic efficacy of pvb in patients undergoing vats procedures and introduce the possibility that a pvb catheter would add value by potentially prolonging our pacu results into postoperative day 1 . in this chart review \n , we can not determine how long the single - injection blocks might have lasted . \n the literature supports a duration of single - shot pvb ranging from 6 hours postoperatively to 12 hours or even longer . \n we know that the block lasted long enough to get the patients through the pacu , so perhaps by placing catheters , we can extend the analgesia in a meaningful way for patients . \n if we get improved analgesia on the floor , then perhaps we begin to impact the ability of patients to ambulate and avoid respiratory complications . \n the out - of - plane approach utilized at our institution may put patients at elevated risk of misplaced injection of local anesthetic , and this needs to be carefully considered . though no adverse events from the pvbs were noted in our chart review , we clearly did not have enough patients to draw any conclusions regarding block safety . \n in summary , the current study presents data suggesting that ultrasound - guided paravertebral blockade using an out - of - plane needle approach may offer a number of clinical benefits to patients undergoing vats procedures .",

      "document": "composite resin restorations should be replaced or repaired in case of failure due to discoloration , recurrent caries beneath the restoration , fractures at the margins , etc . [ \n the repair of composite resin restorations is a conservative and minimally invasive procedure , with advantages such as decrease in costs and time the patients spend on the dental chair , a decrease in the amount of tooth structure lost and prevention of further stimulation of dental pulp [ 14 ] . \n therefore , it is of utmost importance to increase the bond strength and promote the longevity of these repairs . \n several techniques have been proposed to improve the bond strength of composite resins , including air abrasion with aluminum oxide particles measuring 50 m in diameter , etching with hydrofluoric acid and phosphoric acid , use of silanes and roughening of composite resin surfaces with diamond burs [ 512 ] . \n preparation of the composite resin surface plays an important role in the longevity of repaired composite resin . in order to achieve complete adaptation between the old and the new composite , \n an intermediate adhesive substance should be used because the composite resin itself can not completely wet the surface of the old composite resin [ 4,1315 ] . \n the flowability and hydrophobic nature of the intermediate material are important factors involved in selection of such materials . according to papacchini et al , use of a flowable hydrophobic composite resin as an intermediate substance increased the repair bond strength of methacrylate - based composite resins . \n hydrophilicity of the intermediate material can compromise the longevity of the repair bond because hydrophilic adhesives absorb more water over time and undergo hydrolytic degradation . \n one of the major disadvantages of methacrylate - based composite resins is polymerization shrinkage , which results in accumulation of stress within the composite resin and at the composite resin - adhesive interface ; one of the possible complications of such a shrinkage is the cuspal deflection and loss of marginal adaptation , resulting in failure of the restorative material , staining of restoration margins and microleakage . \n to overcome such difficulties , silorane - based composite resins were introduced in 2007 , which consist of a new matrix composed of siloxane and oxirane . \n the aim behind their production was to produce a material with less polymerization shrinkage and subsequently less stress accumulation . \n in addition , silorane exhibits the greatest stability in presence of visible light , along with optimal mechanical properties compared to methacrylate - based composite resins . \n furthermore , the siloxane present in this composite resin makes it highly hydrophobic . in order to make the adhesive system compatible with the silorane - based composite resin , \n the bonding agents for such composite resins contain hydrophobic dimethacrylate monomers ( 7080 wt% ) and are devoid of hydrophilic hema monomer ; therefore they are hydrophobic . \n only a limited number of studies have evaluated the effects of different repair techniques on the repair bond strength of silorane - based composite resins . \n demonstrated that the repair methods used for methacrylate - based composite resins could be also applied for silorane repair . \n surface roughening either with sandblasting or silanization followed by the application of the silorane bonding agent resulted in bond strength values comparable to that of the control group . \n bacchi et al . showed that simultaneous use of an adhesive and sandblasting was successful for the repair of silorane - based composite resins . \n it has been shown that adding an extra layer of hydrophobic resin can improve the repair bond strength of methacrylate - based composite resins and decrease microleakage in such restorations [ 2527 ] . \n therefore , the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of adding an additional layer of hydrophobic resin on the repair shear bond strength of a silorane - based composite resin with the use of two silorane - based and methacrylate - based composite resins . \n twenty cylindrical composite resin blocks , measuring 2.5 mm in diameter and 6 mm in height , were fabricated using filtek p90 silorane - based composite resin ( 3 m espe , st . \n paul , mn , usa ) for evaluation of the cohesive strength of silorane - based composite resin ( the positive control group ) . also , 60 disc - shaped composite resin blocks were fabricated using a silorane - based composite resin ( filtek p90 , 3 m espe , st . \n paul , mn , usa ) by applying unpolymerized composite resin in 1.5 mm layers in cylindrical holes , measuring 5.5 mm in diameter and 3.5 mm in height ; each layer of each block was light - cured separately for 30 seconds using a demetron a-2 light - curing unit ( kerr corporation , middletown , wi , usa ) with a light intensity of 1000 mw / cm . \n the cylindrical holes were created in auto - polymerized resin ( pmma ) and the resin itself was surrounded by a plastic cylinder . \n all the samples underwent an aging procedure after complete polymerization , except for the positive control samples . \n for the aging process , the samples were immersed in 0.9% nacl solution for 72 hours in a container into which light could not penetrate . \n the samples were divided into three groups ( n=20 ) based on the surface preparation technique : group 1 : surface preparation was carried out with a diamond bur ( g & z instrumente gmbh , lustenau , austria ) and etching was carried out with 37% phosphoric acid ( condac , fgm dental products , joinville - sc , brazil ) . then silorane bonding agent ( filtek silorane adhesive bond , 3 m espe st . \n paul , mn , usa ) was applied according to the manufacturer s instructions and light cured for 20 seconds . \n group 2 : surface preparation was carried out with a diamond bur ( g & z instrumente gmbh , lustenau , austria ) , followed by etching with 37% phosphoric acid ( condac , fgm dental products , joinville - sc , brazil ) . finally , silorane bonding agent ( filtek silorane adhesive bond , 3 m espe st . \n paul , mn , usa ) was applied according to manufacturer s instructions and light cured for 20 seconds , followed by the application of the hydrophobic resin - the third component of adper scotchbond multi - purpose adhesive system ( adper scotchbond multi - purpose adhesive , 3 m espe st . \n after surface preparations were carried out as explained above , a plastic mold with an internal diameter of 2.5 mm and height of 5 mm was used to place the silorane - based composite resin on the surface of aged samples ; the mold was placed at the center of the aged samples and the new composite resin ( filtek p90 , 3 m espe , st . \n paul , mn , usa ) was packed and light cured for 20 seconds from each side . \n then the samples were removed from the molds and light cured again for 40 seconds using demetron a-2 light - curing unit ( kerr corporation , middletown , wi , usa ) with a light intensity of 1000 mw / cm . \n contrary to groups 1 and 2 , the blocks made of a methacrylate - based composite resin ( z100 , 3 m espe , st . \n paul , mn , usa ) measuring 2.5 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height were used as the repair composite . for the aging process , \n first all the samples were immersed in 0.9% nacl solution for 24 hours in a container protected from light , followed by thermocycling which consisted of 1500 cycles at 555c with a dwell time of 20 seconds and transfer time of 10 seconds . in the final stage , the shear bond strength values were measured using a universal testing machine ( model h5ks , hounsfield test equipment , surrey , uk ) at a strain rate of 1mm / min . \n the bond strength values were converted to mpa by dividing the maximum force at fracture ( n ) by the surface area of the repair composite resin ( mm ) . \n the results of levene s test approved the assumption of homogeneity of variances between groups ( levene s statistic=5.63 ) . \n thus , the data were analyzed using one - way anova and post - hoc tukey s test ( =0.05 ) . \n in addition , the mode of fracture of the samples , consisting of cohesive in the repair composite resin , cohesive in the repaired composite resin , adhesive and mixed , was evaluated under a stereomicroscope ( nikon , smz 800 , tokyo , japan ) at 20 magnification ( fig . \n streomicroscope images of fracture patterns ( 20 ) which are classified as : a : cohesive in the repairing composite resin , b : cohesive in the repaired composite resin , c : adhesive , and d : mixed \n table 1 presents the mean repair shear bond strength values , standard deviations , standard errors and distribution of modes of fracture in the study groups . \n the results of one - way anova showed significant differences in repair shear bond strength values between the different study groups ( p<0.001 ) . \n pairwise comparisons of the groups with post hoc tukey s test showed significant differences in repair shear bond strength between the positive control group and all the other groups ( p<0.001 ) . \n in addition , there was a significant difference in repair shear bond strength between groups1 and 3 ( p<0.001 ) ; however , the differences between groups 1 and 2 ( p=0.18 ) and groups 2 and 3 ( p=0.20 ) were not statistically significant ( fig . \n the error bar of means and 95% confidence intervals of means bond strengths ( bs ) value in the study group . \n the mean repair shear bond strength values ( mpa ) , standard deviations , standard errors and distribution of fracture modes in the study groups ( n=20 ) different superscripts mean statistically significant differences statistical homogeneous subgroups based on post hoc test \n the repair of composite resin restorations is a conservative and minimally invasive procedure , with some advantages such as decrease in costs and chair time , decreased loss of tooth structure and prevention of dental pulp injuries [ 14 ] . \n it is of significance to improve the repair bond strength and increase the durability of such repairs . \n several studies have shown that use of a hydrophobic resin or a hydrophobic flowable composite resin as an intermediate material for the repair of methacrylate - based composite resins decreases hydrolytic degradation of the bonding layer and increases the repair bond strength . however , the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of adding an extra layer of hydrophobic resin on the repair bond strength of a silorane - based composite resin . due to unavailability of different surface preparation techniques in dental offices and also the results of a study by wiegand et al ,   who showed that the kind of mechanical treatment ( roughening with bur , aluminum oxide sandblasting or silica coating ) is of minor significance for silorane composites , in the current study \n in addition , they showed that silane application was not mandatory when silorane composite along with silorane adhesive was used for repair . \n the silorane bonding agent is not silorane - based but phosphate - dimethacrylate - based . \n the acrylate group of the phosphate - methacrylate based bonding agent can react with methacrylate - based systems and the phosphate groups react with the silorane repair composite . \n therefore , in the current study only the silorane adhesive system was used without additional silane application . \n the results of the current study indicated that adding an extra layer of hydrophobic resin resulted in an increase in repair bond strength of silorane - based composite resins . \n however , this increase in bond strength was only significant in the group in which the repair composite resin was methacrylate - based similar to the hydrophobic resin compared to the group in which the hydrophobic resin was not used . in the group in which an extra layer of hydrophobic resin was used but the repair composite resin was silorane - based , the mean bond strength was higher compared to the group without the hydrophobic resin ; however , this increase was not statistically significant . \n it has been shown that with an increase in the hydrophobicity of the intermediate resin , its water sorption and consequently its hydrolytic degradation decrease . \n this finding is of high clinical significance because dentists often do not know whether the composite to be repaired is a silorane- or a methacrylate - based composite and may routinely use a methacrylate - based composite for this purpose . \n in the current study , higher repair bond strength in group 3 might be attributed to the use of silorane bonding agent and scotchbond multi - purpose , both of which are hydrophobic ; therefore , the bonding layer is more resistant to hydrolytic degradation . as a result , \n the bond strength after thermocycling was higher compared to that in the other two groups . \n in addition , in group 3 both the hydrophobic resin and the repair composite resin were methacrylate - based and chemical bonding might have played a role in this group in addition to micromechanical retention . in contrast , da costa et al . \n showed that use of a hydrophobic resin did not influence the immediate repair bond strength and the repair bond strength six months after storage in water in methacrylate - based composite resins . \n however , some signs of penetration of water and deposition of silver nitrate and early disintegration of the bonding layer were observed in groups in which a more hydrophilic resin was used ; that means the degree of hydrophilicity of the intermediate resin did not influence the immediate bond strength and the repair bond strength after six months . in the afore - mentioned two studies , \n only water storage was performed for six months and thermocycling was not performed for aging . \n lack of difference in repair bond strength values in the aforementioned two studies might be attributed to the fact that aging was not sufficient in these two studies to result in differences in repair bond strength . in contrast , in the current study , storage in water and thermocycling were used simultaneously for aging . \n another finding of the current study was that the repair bond strength values in the positive control group were significantly higher than those in other groups , i.e. none of the groups achieved the cohesive strength of silorane - based composite resin . \n based on the results of previous studies , the repair bond strength of composite resin was 2582% of the cohesive strength of composite resin [ 3335 ] . in the current study , \n the bond strength values were 4451% of the cohesive strength of silorane - based composite resins , consistent with the results of previous studies . \n evaluation of the modes of fracture of different groups led to the conclusion that the majority of failures were of adhesive type in the group in which an extra hydrophobic layer had been used and the repair composite resin was silorane - based . \n group 3 exhibited the highest frequency of cohesive failures and the lowest number of adhesive failures , which was consistent with the bond strength values , i.e. in the group with the highest repair bond strength the maximum cohesive failures and minimum adhesive failures were observed . \n in addition , group 3 was the only group in which cohesive failure in the repair composite resin was observed . a higher rate of adhesive failure in group 2 shows that in this group the adhesive layer was the weakest part of the bonding layer , which might be attributed to the fact that there is no chemical affinity between the hydrophobic resin and the silorane bonding agent and therefore , micromechanical retention is the only mechanism for the repair bond strength . \n this means that although adding an extra layer of hydrophobic resin may increase the longevity of the adhesive layer , it can not result in a significant difference in bond strength due to the lack of chemical similarity between the hydrophobic resin and the superficial composite resin . \n one of the limitations of the current study was the hydrophobic nature of the resin used , which was an unfilled resin ; it is probable that if a filled resin such as a hydrophobic flowable composite resin is used for the repair of a silorane - based composite resin along with a methacrylate - based composite resin , higher repair bond strength values may be achieved . due to specific limitations , \n it is probable that if the thermal cycles are increased or multiple loading is carried out , the effect of the degree of hydrophilicity of the intermediate resin on the repair bond strength will be further elucidated . \n considering the limitations of the current study and the results achieved , it can be concluded that use of an extra layer of a methacrylate - based hydrophobic resin does not influence the repair bond strength during repair of a silorane - based composite with a silorane - based composite . \n however , the use of en extra layer of hydrophobic resin is useful in the repair of silorane - based composite resin with a methacrylate - based composite and can increase the repair bond strength .",

      "document": "diabetic retinopathy ( dr ) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus ( dm ) and is a leading cause of blindness worldwide . \n diabetic macular ischemia ( dmi ) is an important category of diabetic retinopathy ( dr ) [ 2 , 3 ] . during the imaging study of the normal macula , \n an important hallmark is the capillary - free region called foveal avascular zone ( faz ) . \n it is recognized that the faz can enlarge and can become irregular in dr and seems to get larger as the stage of retinopathy advances [ 2 , 3 ] . \n dmi is characterized by the occlusion and loss of the macular capillary network or capillary dropout [ 4 , 5 ] . \n this condition results in upregulation of growth factors , which contributes to the development of diabetic macular edema ( dme ) , the most frequent sight - threatening disorder in individuals with dr . \n dmi is an irreversible category of diabetic maculopathy , and its presence limits the potential benefits of treatments for dr [ 3 , 5 , 6 ] . \n the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study ( etdrs ) established dmi standards that were determined using fluorescein angiography ( fa ) . according to the etdrs report 11 , clinically , there is a correlation between dmi and poor prognosis that varies according to the severity of the macular ischemia . \n the anatomy of the retina appears to be altered in dmi , with thinning of retinal nerve fibre layer ( rnfl ) and outer retina and thickening of outer choroid . in retinal microcirculation \n , blood supply is divided mainly into superficial capillary plexus ( scp ) and deep capillary plexus ( dcp ) . \n choroidal circulation appears to be the most important blood supply to the central macula , including photoreceptor inner segment ( is ) band , which is most likely the most important consumer of oxygen . \n it is likely that the dcp is responsible for up to 15% of the blood supply to the photoreceptors , especially during dark adaptation [ 8 , 10 , 11 ] . \n fa has been the gold standard imaging modality since it was introduced in 1961 [ 7 , 12 , 13 ] however , it requires venipuncture , and reports of anaphylaxis and death related to contrast injections , despite being rare , have been documented . \n in addition , the technique is costly and time - consuming , requiring up to 10 minutes for framing acquisition [ 4 , 8 , 10 , 11 ] . \n spectral domain ( sd ) oct has emerged as a potential alternative for detecting macular nonperfusion in diabetic patients , but results are contradictory [ 1 , 2 , 13 ] . \n macular ischemia may disrupt the normal flow of nutrients to the outer retina , but photoreceptor status on sd - oct remains controversial . in diabetic patients , the disruption of photoreceptors in sd - oct can indicate a manifestation of underlying dcp nonperfusion in patients with a relatively healthy macula [ 1416 ] . \n oct angiography ( octa ) has been used for 3d mapping at microcirculation level [ 9 , 1316 ] . \n it allows detection of retinal and choroidal structures via motion contrast imaging and high speed scanning , which detect blood flow by analysing signal decorrelations between scans [ 7 , 11 , 14 , 15 ] . \n both inner and outer retinal capillary plexuses are imaged in contradistinction in conventional angiography , which does not effectively image the outer plexus . \n this study aimed to compare the use of fluorescein angiography and octa in the diagnosis and quantification of dmi when applying a split - spectrum amplitude - decorrelation angiography algorithm ( ssada )   to improve the detection of flow signals in angiography with the purpose of offering a suitable  sparing  contrast alternative using 3  mm  3  mm octa for clinical investigations of diabetic patients [ 8 , 1520 ] . \n this was a retrospective cross - sectional comparative study analysis conducted at federal university of goias and approved by ethics committee of the same institution . signed informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to enrolment . \n imaging data were collected from patients who underwent fa and octa on the same day in a tertiary referral retina center in the period between january 1 , 2015 , and july 30 , 2015 . \n exclusion criteria included significant cataract ( without surgical indications at the time of examination ) , previous retinal arterial or venous occlusion , inherited macular dystrophy , posterior segment inflammation , and macular degeneration or scarring of any cause . \n subjects that presented motion artifacts during octa or poor signal strength were also not included in this study . \n all subjects underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination , including best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) on etdrs charts , + 78  d noncontact lens slit - lamp fundoscopy , color fundus photography , and fa and oct angiography , on a single day . \n color fundus photographs were obtained and fa was performed using a digital retinal camera ( topcon trc 50dx ; topcon , paramus , nj ) . \n the central macular nonperfusion area , faz boundaries , and the maximum height and area were manually delineated . \n the faz area was measured using a single fa photograph , such as the octa angiogram of the scp and then divided into \n ( superior to 0.32  mm ) and  small  ( inferior to 0.32  mm ) groups . \n group comprised both  moderate  and  severe  etdrs established grading groups [ 3 , 19 , 20 ] . \n the quantification of macular nonperfusion in both fa and oct angiography captured images was completed using imagej software ( imagej , national institutes of health , bethesda , md ) . \n octa instrument used was the rtvue xr avanti with angiovue software for octa ( optovue , inc . , \n fremont , ca ) , and imaging data were obtained using the split - spectrum amplitude - decorrelation angiography ( ssada )   software . \n the algorithm was employed to improve the signal - to - noise ratio [ 8 , 1521 ] . \n this instrument operates at ~840  nm wavelength , 70,000 a - scans per second , and a bandwidth of 50  nm . \n the tissue resolution is 5  m axially and there is a 15  m beam width . \n each b - scan consisted of 304 a - scans for a total of 2  304  304 a - scans per acquisition , with a total acquisition time of approximately 3 seconds . \n the scanning area was captured in 3  mm  3  mm sections , and the acquired oct volumes were centered on the fovea [ 811 ] . \n a 3  mm  3  mm octa image was used primarily because this size is the one that provides images with higher resolution in the used octa device [ 10 , 11 ] . \n the ssada algorithm was used to generate a volumetric rendering of blood flow from the internal limiting membrane ( ilm ) to the choroid , and it allowed the direct visualization of normal and abnormal blood circulation [ 1821 ] . for the octa angiograms , \n it was used the automatic segmentation of the retinal layers at the level of the scp generated by the angiovue software in an orthogonal view . in order to correct for automated segmentation error and projection artifacts , \n the segmentation slab was manually adjusted , using corresponding structural oct b - scans as a guide for the placement of 2 segmentation lines : the inner located at 3  m beneath the internal limiting membrane and the outer boundary at 15  m beneath the inner plexiform layer . \n this semiautomatic method permitted the readers to select images that pictured the largest extent of scp for subsequent quantitative analysis . \n the dcp image was segmented with an inner boundary 15  m beneath the inner plexiform layer and an outer boundary at 70  m beneath the inner plexiform layer . \n this section captured both layers of the outer capillary plexus , which sandwiched the inner nuclear layer . \n all statistical analyses were performed using statistical package for social science 22.0 ( ibm spss ; ibm , armonk , ny ) . \n fa and octa images were independently reviewed by two independent masked readers retina specialists ( jg and di ) who reached an agreement regarding the area ( mm ) of macular nonperfusion that was obtained using both methods according to etdrs report 11 . \n intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) was used to estimate the agreement between individual measurements from both readers . \n since the icc was consistently > 0.9 between the 2 readers , nonparametric wilcoxon signed - rank test was used to compare area measurements performed by 1 reader on fa and octa 3  mm  3  mm scans . \n thirty - four eyes from 34 patients , including 20 ( 58.82% ) females and 14 ( 41.18% ) males , were enrolled and separated according macular status ( table 1 ) . \n twenty - four eyes from 24 patients were placed in the group of patients with dmi , including 15 ( 62.5% ) females and 9 ( 37.5% ) males . \n the mean ( sd ) age of the dmi population was 61.20  6.95 years . \n the group without dmi comprised 10 patients , including 5 ( 50% ) females and 5 ( 50% ) males . \n four eyes from 2 patients were excluded from the study due to a high quantity of motion artifacts . \n patients with dmi presented a mean fa of 0.68  0.53  mm ( 95% ic , 0.460.90 ; p < 0.05 ) . \n octa angiogram analysis demonstrated a mean of 0.58  0.35  mm ( 95% ic , 0.430.73 ; p < 0.05 ) . \n the wilcoxon signed - rank test did not identify a significant difference between fa and octa in patients diagnosed with dmi ( p = 0.1374 ) . \n patients without dmi presented a mean fa of 0.19  0.67  mm ( 95% ic , 0.140.24 ; p < 0.05 ) . \n octa angiogram analysis demonstrated a mean of 0.20  0.79  mm ( 95% ic , 0.150.26 ; p < 0.05 ) . \n the wilcoxon signed - rank test did not identify a significant difference between fa and octa in patients without dmi ( p = 0.9594 ) ( figure 1 ) . \n the iccs for faz area measurements between 2 observers with respect to fa and octa were 0.96 ( ic : 0.360.71 ) and 0.92 ( ic : 0.350.79 ) , respectively , demonstrating the reproducibility and consistency of the methodology . \n this result highlights the notion that the faz is most often clearly demarcated by a distinct foveal vascular ring and that its abnormalities , in addition to its capillary dropout , can be lucidly obtained from octa images . \n etdrs research group connected the severity of macular nonperfusion to the potential for progression in dr . \n in fact , in dr , the advanced deterioration of macular perfusion is the basis for macular ischemia , and developing a method to perceive perfusion maps may allow correlations between central ischemia and the different stages of dr . \n however , it is an invasive method requiring venipuncture and contrast infusion ; it is a time - consuming test and provides only 2-dimensional images . \n therefore , reports of anaphylaxis and death related to contrast injections have been documented , despite being rare . \n octa is a noninvasive method , obtains highly detailed 3-dimensional images without requiring injection of a contrast dye , and allows faster acquisition of images ( figure 2 ) [ 9 , 10 , 1214 ] . \n octa performed using a split - spectrum amplitude - decorrelation angiography ( ssada ) algorithm has already been shown to be useful for imaging microvascular changes in dr [ 811 , 14 , 20 ] . \n cole et al . also observed macular nonperfusion in a diabetic patient in a 3  mm  3  mm octa that was centered on the fovea by applying a similar technology . \n the 3  mm  3  mm octa central sections obtained using sd - oct allowed us to obtain a higher resolution over a small area ( figure 3 ) . \n this area was sufficient for detecting central dmi , but it was not large enough to identify peripheral retinal nonperfusion . \n high - resolution oct imaging allows measuring thickness of segmented retinal layers in angiographically apparent ischemic dr . \n future octa devices improvements may provide clinicians the ability to obtain wider field images with better resolution . in the present study , statistical analysis \n also did not indicate significant difference between area measurements obtained with fa and octa in patients diagnosed with dmi . \n the same has occurred among patient without dmi regarding the measurement of normal faz area . \n the icc for the zaf area between the 2 observers on fa and octa demonstrated the reproducibility and consistency of used methodology . \n these results highlight the notion that faz is most frequently demarcated by a distinct foveal vascular ring and its abnormalities , in addition to its capillary dropout , can be lucidly obtained from octa imaging device . \n first , all of the results were obtained during a single appointment , and there was no follow - up . \n the present study demonstrates that fluorescein angiography and octa provide similar results when used to diagnose macular ischemia in diabetic patients . with further improvements \n in summary , octa may provide images with higher details regarding macular status , becoming a novel imaging technique for the diagnosis of dmi , and may become an alternative to fa for this purpose . \n the results also offer improved quantification of faz area in diabetic patients without dmi when compared to diabetic subjects with established macular ischemia .",

      "document": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Health Protection Act of \n2015''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Access to safe, legal abortion services is essential to \n        women's health and central to women's ability to participate \n        equally in the economic and social life of the United States.\n            (2) Access to safe, legal abortion services has been \n        hindered in the United States in various ways, including \n        blockades of health care facilities and associated violence; \n        restrictions on insurance coverage; restrictions on minors' \n        ability to obtain services; and requirements and restrictions \n        that single out abortion providers and those seeking their \n        services, and which do not further women's health or the safety \n        of abortion, but harm women by reducing the availability of \n        services.\n            (3) In the early 1990s, protests and blockades at health \n        care facilities where abortions were performed, and associated \n        violence, increased dramatically and reached crisis level, \n        requiring Congressional action. Congress passed the Freedom of \n        Access to Clinic Entrances Act (Public Law 103-259) to address \n        that situation and ensure that women could physically access \n        abortion services.\n            (4) Since 2010, there has been an equally dramatic increase \n        in the number of laws and regulations singling out abortion \n        that threaten women's health and their ability to access safe \n        abortion services by interfering with health care \n        professionals' ability to provide such services. Congressional \n        action is now necessary to put an end to these restrictions. In \n        addition, there has been a dramatic increase in the passage of \n        laws that blatantly violate the constitutional protections \n        afforded women, such as bans on abortion prior to viability.\n            (5) Legal abortion is one of the safest medical procedures \n        in the United States. That safety is furthered by regulations \n        that are based on science and are generally applicable to the \n        medical profession or to medically comparable procedures.\n            (6) Many State and local governments are imposing \n        restrictions on the provision of abortion that are neither \n        science-based nor generally applicable to the medical \n        profession or to medically comparable procedures. Though \n        described by their proponents as health and safety regulations, \n        many of these abortion-specific restrictions do not advance the \n        safety of abortion services and do nothing to protect women's \n        health. Also, these restrictions interfere with women's \n        personal and private medical decisions, make access to abortion \n        more difficult and costly, and even make it impossible for some \n        women to obtain those services.\n            (7) These restrictions harm women's health by reducing \n        access not only to abortion services but also to the other \n        essential health care services offered by the providers \n        targeted by the restrictions, including contraceptive services, \n        which reduce unintended pregnancies and thus abortions, and \n        screenings for cervical cancer and sexually transmitted \n        infections. These harms fall especially heavily on low-income \n        women, women of color, and women living in rural and other \n        medically underserved areas.\n            (8) The cumulative effect of these numerous restrictions \n        has been widely varying access to abortion services such that a \n        woman's ability to exercise her constitutional rights is \n        dependent on the State in which she lives. Federal legislation \n        putting a stop to harmful restrictions throughout the United \n        States is necessary to ensure that women in all States have \n        access to safe abortion services, an essential constitutional \n        right repeatedly affirmed by the United States Supreme Court.\n            (9) Congress has the authority to protect women's ability \n        to access abortion services pursuant to its powers under the \n        Commerce Clause and its powers under section 5 of the \n        Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution to enforce the \n        provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to protect women's \nhealth by ensuring that abortion services will continue to be available \nand that abortion providers are not singled out for medically \nunwarranted restrictions that harm women by preventing them from \naccessing safe abortion services. It is not the purpose of this Act to \naddress all threats to access to abortion (for example, this Act does \nnot apply to clinic violence, restrictions on insurance or medical \nassistance coverage of abortion, or requirements for parental consent \nor notification before a minor may obtain an abortion) which Congress \nshould address through separate legislation as appropriate.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Abortion.--The term ``abortion'' means any medical \n        treatment, including the prescription of medication, intended \n        to cause the termination of a pregnancy except for the purpose \n        of increasing the probability of a live birth, to remove an \n        ectopic pregnancy, or to remove a dead fetus.\n            (2) Abortion provider.--The term ``abortion provider'' \n        means a health care professional who performs abortions.\n            (3) Government.--The term ``government'' includes a branch, \n        department, agency, instrumentality, or individual acting under \n        color of law of the United States, a State, or a subdivision of \n        a State.\n            (4) Health care professional.--The term ``health care \n        professional'' means a licensed medical professional (including \n        physicians, certified nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, and \n        physician assistants) who is competent to perform abortions \n        based on clinical training.\n            (5) Medically comparable procedures.--The term ``medically \n        comparable procedures'' means medical procedures that are \n        similar in terms of risk, complexity, duration, or the degree \n        of sterile precaution that is indicated.\n            (6) Pregnancy.--The term ``pregnancy'' refers to the period \n        of the human reproductive process beginning with the \n        implantation of a fertilized egg.\n            (7) State.--The term ``State'' includes each of the 50 \n        States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n        Rico, and each territory or possession of the United States.\n            (8) Viability.--the term ``viability'' means the point in a \n        pregnancy at which, in the good-faith medical judgment of the \n        treating health care professional, based on the particular \n        facts of the case before her or him, there is a reasonable \n        likelihood of sustained fetal survival outside the uterus with \n        or without artificial support.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITED MEASURES AND ACTIONS.\n\n    (a) General Prohibitions.--The following limitations or \nrequirements are unlawful and shall not be imposed or applied by any \ngovernment because they single out the provision of abortion services \nfor restrictions that are more burdensome than those restrictions \nimposed on medically comparable procedures, they do not significantly \nadvance women's health or the safety of abortion services, and they \nmake abortion services more difficult to access:\n            (1) A requirement that a medical professional perform \n        specific tests or medical procedures in connection with the \n        provision of an abortion, unless generally required for the \n        provision of medically comparable procedures.\n            (2) A requirement that the same clinician who performs a \n        patient's abortion also perform specified tests, services or \n        procedures prior, or subsequent, to the abortion.\n            (3) A limitation on an abortion provider's ability to \n        prescribe or dispense drugs based on current evidence-based \n        regimens or her or his good-faith medical judgment, other than \n        a limitation generally applicable to the medical profession.\n            (4) A limitation on an abortion provider's ability to \n        provide abortion services via telemedicine, other than a \n        limitation generally applicable to the provision of medical \n        services via telemedicine.\n            (5) A requirement or limitation concerning the physical \n        plant, equipment, staffing, or hospital transfer arrangements \n        of facilities where abortions are performed, or the credentials \n        or hospital privileges or status of personnel at such \n        facilities, that is not imposed on facilities or the personnel \n        of facilities where medically comparable procedures are \n        performed.\n            (6) A requirement that, prior to obtaining an abortion, a \n        patient make one or more medically unnecessary in-person visits \n        to the provider of abortion services or to any individual or \n        entity that does not provide abortion services.\n            (7) A requirement or limitation that prohibits or restricts \n        medical training for abortion procedures, other than a \n        requirement or limitation generally applicable to medical \n        training for medically comparable procedures.\n    (b) Other Prohibited Measures or Actions.--\n            (1) In general.--A measure or action directed at \n        restricting the provision of abortion services or the \n        facilities that provide abortion services that is similar to \n        any of the prohibited limitations or requirements described in \n        subsection (a) shall be unlawful if such measure or action \n        singles out abortion services or makes abortion services more \n        difficult to access and does not significantly advance women's \n        health or the safety of abortion services.\n            (2) Prima facie case.--To make a prima facie showing that a \n        measure or action is unlawful under paragraph (1) a plaintiff \n        shall demonstrate that the measure or action involved--\n                    (A) singles out the provision of abortion services \n                or facilities in which abortion services are performed; \n                or\n                    (B) impedes women's access to abortion services \n                based on one or more of the factors described in \n                paragraph (3).\n            (3) Factors.--Factors for a court to consider in \n        determining whether a measure or action impedes access to \n        abortion services for purposes of paragraph (2)(B) include the \n        following:\n                    (A) Whether the measure or action interferes with \n                an abortion provider's ability to provide care and \n                render services in accordance with her or his good-\n                faith medical judgment.\n                    (B) Whether the measure or action is reasonably \n                likely to delay some women in accessing abortion \n                services.\n                    (C) Whether the measure or action is reasonably \n                likely to directly or indirectly increase the cost of \n                providing abortion services or the cost for obtaining \n                abortion services (including costs associated with \n                travel, childcare, or time off work).\n                    (D) Whether the measure or action requires, or is \n                reasonably likely to have the effect of necessitating, \n                a trip to the offices of the abortion provider that \n                would not otherwise be required.\n                    (E) Whether the measure or action is reasonably \n                likely to result in a decrease in the availability of \n                abortion services in the State.\n                    (F) Whether the measure or action imposes criminal \n                or civil penalties that are not imposed on other health \n                care professionals for comparable conduct or failure to \n                act or that are harsher than penalties imposed on other \n                health care professionals for comparable conduct or \n                failure to act.\n                    (G) The cumulative impact of the measure or action \n                combined with other new or existing requirements or \n                restrictions.\n            (4) Defense.--A measure or action shall be unlawful under \n        this subsection upon making a prima facie case (as provided for \n        under paragraph (2)), unless the defendant establishes, by \n        clear and convincing evidence, that--\n                    (A) the measure or action significantly advances \n                the safety of abortion services or the health of women; \n                and\n                    (B) the safety of abortion services or the health \n                of women cannot be advanced by a less restrictive \n                alternative measure or action.\n    (c) Other Prohibitions.--The following restrictions on the \nperformance of abortion are unlawful and shall not be imposed or \napplied by any government:\n            (1) A prohibition or ban on abortion prior to fetal \n        viability.\n            (2) A prohibition on abortion after fetal viability when, \n        in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating physician, \n        continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant \n        woman's life or health.\n            (3) A restriction that limits a pregnant woman's ability to \n        obtain an immediate abortion when a health care professional \n        believes, based on her or his good-faith medical judgment, that \n        delay would pose a risk to the woman's health.\n            (4) A measure or action that prohibits or restricts a woman \n        from obtaining an abortion prior to fetal viability based on \n        her reasons or perceived reasons or that requires a woman to \n        state her reasons before obtaining an abortion prior to fetal \n        viability.\n    (d) Limitation.--The provisions of this Act shall not apply to laws \nregulating physical access to clinic entrances, requirements for \nparental consent or notification before a minor may obtain an abortion, \ninsurance coverage or medical assistance of abortion, or the procedure \ndescribed in section 1531(b)(1) of title 18, United States Code.\n    (e) Effective Date.--This Act shall apply to government \nrestrictions on the provision of abortion services, whether statutory \nor otherwise, whether they are enacted or imposed prior to or after the \ndate of enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.

sectional ct images at baseline and 3 months post - treatment . \n in addition , clinical observation was performed to evaluate the safety of the graft material , and antibody against rhbmp-2 was tested to evaluate its immunological safety . \n no clinical adverse reactions or even inflammatory responses were observed in patients who received the bone graft . \n basedon the immunological evaluations of the blood tests at the fifth visit of 72 patients ( 36 in the control group and 36 in the experiment group ) , none of the patients were suspected of having developed antibodies against the bone graft material . \n ct images were analyzed using the same software ( ondemend , cybermed inc , la , ca , usa ) at the same site immediately after transplantation and 3 months post - transplantation . \n changes in alveolar bone height were considered as a major evaluation variable in determining the effectiveness of the bone graft for alveolar bone regeneration . based on ct scans at baseline and 3 months post - transplantation , \n the changing rate of the alveolar bone height , was higher in the control group than in the experimental group ( p<.05 ) . \n changes in alveolar bone width were considered a minor evaluation variable in determining the effectiveness of the bone graft in alveolar bone regeneration . in this study , materials other than the subject 's gingiva ( e.g. , collagen membrane and others ) were excluded in order to eliminate the effects of other factors . however , one crucial factor that affects the outcome of the conventional guided - bone regeneration ( gbr ) procedure is the fact that the treatment area must be protected from the surrounding soft tissue . \n therefore , because of chewing , brushing and other oral habits , as well as differences in remaining gingival levels , the tested bone graft material did not survive at the treatment site over a sufficient time period . \n therefore , it is conceivable that if the bone graft material is transplanted after allowing the gingival tissue to heal to a certain extent after the extraction , rather than being transplanted immediately after extraction , the alveolar bone preservation effect of the bone graft material may increase . \n in this study , -tcp / ha bone grafts coated with erhbmp-2 were found to be more effective in preserving alveolar bone than conventional -tcp / ha alloplastic bone grafts . \n furthermore , during the experiment , no adverse reactions to the graft material were observed . \n thus , this alloplastic bone graft coated with erhbmp-2 is considered to be an effective bone graft material .",

month follow - up , \n since the introduction of guglielmi detachable coils in 1991 , endovascular treatment with detachable coils has been established as a mainstay therapy for intracranial aneurysms.6)12 ) with the development of neuroendovascular techniques , endovascular coil embolization has become a valid and increasingly used alternative to surgical clip obliteration in patients with intracranial aneurysms.9)17 ) however , despite increasing clinical experience and technical improvements , endovascular treatment still has inherent risks for morbidity and mortality.11 ) several technical complications include intraprocedural aneurysmal rupture , thromboembolism , parent artery occlusion and coil migration , coil stretching , coil fracture either during the procedure or after coil embolization , and vasospasm of the parent artery . \n the most common complication of endovascular coil embolization for the aneurysm is thromboembolic event , which may result from poor technique , endovascular devices , and/or poor flushing of the catheter systems.11)14 ) although coil migration into the parent artery is not a common event , it is one of the most feared complications that can occur during endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms and might be related to poor functional outcomes.2)4)13)15 ) migration of coils or stents from their targets may be one of the most challenging complications of endovascular neurosurgery and contributes significantly to thromboembolic events when it comes to the endovascular embolization.8 ) development of remodeling devices such as stents and balloons has recently made endovascular coil embolization a popular treatment option for mca aneurysm . \n such a procedure has also provided equivalent angiographic results and showed an acceptable complication rate compared with aneurysmal neck clipping.7 ) hence , compared with neurosurgical clipping , endovascular treatment should be the first treatment option for unruptured cerebral aneurysms in any location because it is cost - effective and has a lower morbidity and mortality rate.16 ) in addition , for patients with ruptured aneurysms judged to be technically amenable to both endovascular coiling and neurosurgical clipping , american heart association / american stroke association recommends that surgeons consider endovascular coiling as a preferred treatment option.3 ) despite the worldwide popularity of endovascular treatment for intracranial aneurysms , surgical aneurysmal neck clipping is the primary treatment option for mca aneurysms . \n not only are they easily accessed in the surgical clipping approach , but also these aneurysms often have broad necks relative to the sac width and may partially incorporate one or both of the m2 branches into the aneurysm neck.7 ) the patient was incidentally found to have an unruptured aneurysm on the left mca bifurcation with a relatively broad neck during a health check - up . even though the neck of the aneurysm was relatively broad , the decision was made to occlude it by endovascular coil embolization due to a large dome to neck ratio ( > 1.5 ) . however , a coil migration into the distal parent artery occurred during the embolization , especially for particularly broad - neck aneurysms . \n possible causes include a size mismatch between the embolized coil and the caliber of the parent artery , inadequate position of the microcatheter within the aneurysm , mechanical vasospasm due to catheter manipulation in the early stage of the endovascular procedure,1)5)11 ) disuse of an assisting device like stent or balloon , and unskillful technique of an inexperienced operator . \n an emergency surgical operation for complications associated with coil embolization is uncommon,10 ) however , as mentioned above , coil embolization is still associated with fatal complications . \n obstruction with migration of a coil into the parent artery may be particularly difficult to resolve with an endovascular procedure.13 ) use of a coil retrieval device is a possible alternative , but this may require negotiating through the clot and may be associated with complications like perforation.10 ) further endovascular procedures may risk pushing the migrated coil more distally , resulting in a more complex situation . \n in addition , it has been reported that an open surgery could be the best option when endovascular procedures are difficult or unsuccessful.2)13 ) coil embolectomy , vessel repair , and aneurysmal neck clipping are necessary for surgical treatment after such distal coil migration . however , removal of intravascular coils is not always possible due to adhesion to the arterial wall . in such a case , \n revascularization procedures such as superficial temporal artery - mca bypass may even be necessary ; therefore , it is important to preserve the superficial temporal artery when performing surgery.15 ) \n for achievement of a successful endovascular coil embolization , selection of the right indication is essential and should be performed carefully because unexpected complication can occur during the procedure . \n neurosurgical management is one of the most effective ways to revascularize parent artery occlusion by coil migration . in order not to leave any sequela associated with coil migration , \n rapid extraction of the migrated coil as possible is critical , and , for this reason , a skillful neurovascular specialist who can provide appropriate surgical management and endovascular management for such a patient with a coil migration complication can come in handy .",

antigen was positive ( table 1 ) . a computed tomography ( ct ) showed a peripherally enhanced low density mass 7.5 cm in diameter , which located in segment 6 in the right lobe of the liver ( figure 1(a ) ) . \n the tumor was accompanied with tumor thrombus to the posterior branch of portal vein ( figure 1(b ) ) . \n celiac angiography showed this lesion was hypervascular ( figure 1(c ) ) and portal vein tumor thrombus in posterior segment was observed in the portal phase ( figure 1(d ) ) . \n patients have chronic hepatitis b and then tumor was hypervascular and accompanied with portal thrombus , which is the feature of hcc , therefore a preoperative diagnosis was made as hcc with portal vein thrombus and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs were used to reduce the fever . \n a single nodule of disseminated cancer cells was found near the posterior segment on the abdominal wall during the operation . \n posterior segmentectomy of the liver and thrombectomy including the dissemination was performed . on the cut section , \n the noncancerous liver tissue showed a moderate chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the fibrous stroma , diagnosed as liver fibrosis . \n immunohistochemical stain of il-8 was performed with paraffin embedded sections of liver tissue using mouse monoclonal antibody at dilutions of 1 : 100 ( assay designs , ann arbor , usa ) . \n the subsequent reaction was performed by the peroxidase labeled streptavidin - biotin technique using histofine sab - po kit ( nichirei , tokyo , japan ) . \n il-8 was observed in the cytoplasm of cancer cells ( figure 3(b ) ) . \n after the tumor resection , fever disappeared and crp dropped gradually from 16.7 to 2.7 , but the patient had recurrence with multiple liver metastasis and pleuritis carcinomatosa and died on february 2 , 2006 , 79 days after the operation . \n in 1991 , okuda et al .   reported five patients with hcc and pyrexia , for an incidence of less than 1% , in japan . \n he also mentioned that very poorly differentiated sarcomatoid hcc may frequently appear with pyrexia and leukocytosis mimicking liver abscess . in 1995 , hayashi et al .   reported hcc with pyrexia \n laboratory data revealed high crp . nevertheless , in both case reports , the mechanism of a fever was not revealed . in our case , \n the sarcomatoid change of the cancer cell was not detected , only poorly differentiated hcc . \n it is well known that cancer cells produce humoral factors and cause the  paraneoplastic syndrome  . among the clinical symptoms and laboratory data , fever and high crp , \n which is not commonly observed in the patients with hcc , is suspected to be due to humoral factors , especially inflammatory cytokine . \n il-8 is a proinflammatory cytokine whose principal role in infection and inflammation appears to be the recruitment and activation of circulating and tissue neutrophils to the site of tissue damage . \n it has been demonstrated that il-8 is produced by a wide variety of cell types in vitro , including endothelium , monocytes , eosinophils , astrocytes and keratinocytes . in sepsis patients , for example , \n il-8 concentrations have been reported as being markedly elevated at diagnosis and remaining high during the course of the illness . \n this symptom is induced by many humoral factors , including il1 , il-6 , il8 and tnf. zampronio ar reported that il-8 induced fever by prostaglandin independent mechanism . \n il-8 resulted in a dose - dependent increase of crp , a decrease in the production of transferring and prealbumin . \n therefore , il-8 is related to pyrexia in parts , not all .    in other cancer , \n we examined by immunohistochemical staining of il-8 and tumor tissue stained positive for il-8 in this case . \n akiba et al .   reported that a high il-8 level in hcc had a significantly higher frequency of portal vein invasion and venous invasion and bile duct invasion . in vitro \n reported il-8 production was enhanced progressively with escalating severity of hepatitis and the development of hcc and the level of il-8 were significantly increased in patients with advanced hcc with distant metastasis , and then this leads to poor prognosis . \n ren et al . reported serum il-8 level was correlated with tumor size and tumor stage , and then il-8 level was a significant prognostic factor in terms of disease - free survival and overall survival . \n additionally , elevated il-8 levels in the drainage vein of colorectal cancer are related to the occurrence of hepatic metastasis . \n this case presented portal vein tumor thrombus , bile duct invasion , intrahepatic metastasis , peritoneal dissemination , early tumor recurrence , rapid tumor regrowth and finally a poor prognosis . \n in fact , all patients with il-8 production do not have a high fever , the serum concentration of il-8 or the degree of neutrophil infiltration will be concerned with pyrexia .    in many cancers such as esophageal cancer , gastric cancer and colorectal cancer , \n serum crp was known as a prognostic indicator [ 2023 ] . in particular , some reported that serum crp levels indicated a poor prognosis in hcc patients and portal vein invasion was significantly higher in the serum crp - positive group [ 24 , 25 ] . according to the in vitro previous studies , cultured hcc can produce crp that is regulated in part by proinflammatory cytokines , such as il-6 , il-8 and tnf- [ 18 , 26 , 27 ] . among the many proinflammatory cytokines , recent report il-6 mediates cell cycle arrest in hepatocellular carcinoma through a stat 3-dependent pathway \n hcc produce proinflammatory cytokines such as il-8 by autocrine or paracrine , which lead to crp production and inflammatory cascade or tumor progression . \n in this report we discussed a patient who had poorly differentiated hcc with pyrexia and high crp . \n il-8 production was histologically revealed in this case and may have contributed to the high fever , high inflammatory reaction and poor prognosis .",

like symptoms in the form of rhinorrhea and low - grade fever . \n this was followed by irritableness , hypoactivity , and inability to move his legs and arms . \n he was seen in a private hospital where computed tomography of the brain and a lumber puncture were done that showed no abnormalities . in the next day , his condition continued to worsen . \n he developed difficulty in swallowing and dark - colored urine , so he was transferred to our institution . upon physical examination , \n the laboratory tests showed elevated creatine kinase level ( 1 778 856 u / l ; normal range 20 - 200 \n u / l ) , elevated serum transaminases ( serum glutamic - pyruvic transaminase [ sgpt ] = 1857 \n u / l [ normal range 0 - 50 u / l ] , serum glutamic - oxaloacetic transaminase [ sgot ] = 8626 u / l [ normal range 0 - 50 u / l ] ) , and creatinine 0.72 mg / dl ( 0.3 - 0.7 mg / dl ) . \n the child started on intravenous hydration and received 1 dose of intravenous immunoglobulin . on the second day , \n the creatine kinase and serum transaminase levels improved , with creatinine reaching 0.94 mg / dl , the highest level reached . \n the creatine kinase and serum transaminase levels continued to improve gradually over the following days , with slow improvement in the clinical condition . \n he received another 2 doses of intravenous immunoglobulin on days 13 and 14 of admission . \n muscle biopsy showed endomysial inflammatory infiltrates , mostly composed of cd8 and cd4 lymphocytes ; myofibers necrosis mostly ventral portion of myofibers ; residual granular microcalcifications ; and terminal complement complex deposits that outline necrotic myofibers , all features compatible with necrotic myopathy and early rhabdomyolysis ( figure 2 ) . \n the arrows showed the degenerated myofibers . upon discharge , the child had mild muscle aches , was able to sit , and move his arms and feet . \n he had persistent weakness in the lower limbs , but was unable to walk , with a follow - up examination 1 month after discharge , revealing that the child was able to walk normally with positive deep tendon reflex . \n two months after discharge , the creatine kinase level dropped to 193 iu / l . \n rhabdomyolysis results from skeletal muscle breakdown due to various causes . viral myositis , trauma , and inherited disorders are the most common causes in the pediatric age group . \n the breakdown releases the normal cell contents into the bloodstream , including creatine kinase , myoglobin , phosphorus , and potassium . \n rhabdomyolysis is suspected clinically when muscle aches , muscle weakness , and tea - colored urine are present . \n the diagnosis is based on the high creatine kinase level , which is the most sensitive marker . although there is no established cutoff levels , a concentration 5 to 10 times higher than the upper limit of normal reference range ( ie , 500 - 1000 \n other laboratory indicators include serum and urine myoglobin concentrations that may be useful but not essential for the diagnosis . \n the most common complication of rhabdomyolysis is kidney damage . in recent large pediatric studies reported by mannix \n et al and wu et al , it was shown that the rate of acute renal failure in the pediatric patients with rhabdomyolysis ranged from 5% to 8.7% . \n the risk factors that predispose a patient with rhabdomyolysis for developing acute renal injury are creatine kinase level concentration more than 5000 u / l , creatine kinase value upon admission , and slower decline in the serum creatine kinase level . \n other factors include high myoglobin level , persistent or abrupt increase in the potassium or calcium level , as well as persistent metabolic acidosis . \n on the other hand , a recent study by fernandez et al showed that the most reliable predictor of acute renal failure and the need for dialysis is the creatinine level above 1.7 , despite the peak creatine kinase . \n the mainstay for the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury is early and aggressive volume resuscitation . \n other management options include alkalization of the urine , forced diuresis with mannitol , and loop diuretics . in severe cases or \n in our case , the child developed extremely high creatine kinase levels that were not reported in the literature . \n a thorough literature review was done searching for high creatine kinase levels in patients with acute rhabdomyolysis . in 2014 , a case report described a pediatric patient with mcardle disease who developed rhabdomyolysis with a high 6-digit creatine kinase level reaching 500 000 \n 2 pediatric cases were reported . in both , the creatine kinase levels reached were 60 000 \n a case report of an adolescent with rhabdomyolysis due to undiagnosed hypothyroidism was reported with a creatine kinase level that reached around 34 000 \n a research article in 2013 examined the clinical spectrum of patients with rhabdomyolysis presenting to the pediatric emergency department , in which the peak serum level of creatine kinase was 9825.1  23 079.1 \n the only risk factor for developing acute renal injury that our patient had was a high peak creatine kinase level upon admission . on the other hand , \n he did not develop metabolic acidosis and had a normal albumin and electrolytes levels throughout his hospitalization . \n he responded very well to volume resuscitation with rapid decline in the creatine kinase level . \n although he received intravenous immunoglobulin for the fear of guillain - barre syndrome or other underlying immune - mediated diseases , neither the creatine kinase level decline nor the clinical status improvement was affected by the intravenous immunoglobulin administration . the sharp decline in the creatine kinase level \n there are no clues in the family history or the patient s personal history that may suggest an underlying inherited metabolic , muscular , or genetic disease . \n , this could be the first presentation of lipin-1 mutation that causes recurrent rhabdomyolysis in children . \n lipin-1 gene encodes the muscle - specific phosphatidic acid phosphatase , a key enzyme in triglyceride and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis . \n the episodes of rhabdomyolysis are mostly triggered by intercurrent infections and fever and to a lesser extent by fasting or exercise . \n the prognosis of lipin-1 deficiency is poor , with up to one - third of patients dying during an episode of rhabdomyolysis . in about 60% of patients with recurrent rhabdomyolysis ,",

The Department of the Treasury must transfer additional funds to the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan to pay pension benefits required under that plan if the amounts available for transfer under SMCRA's $490 million annual limit exceed the amounts required to be transferred for other purposes (including to the UMWA Health Plans).  The bill also: (1) prohibits the pension plan from making certain changes to benefits during any year in which a transfer is received, and (2) establishes additional reporting requirements for the plan. As an offset, the bill amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to extend the authority of Treasury to collect certain customs user fees. ",

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Food allergy is an increasing food safety and public \n        health concern in the United States, especially among students.\n            (2) Peanut allergy doubled among children from 1997 to \n        2002.\n            (3) In a 2004 survey of 400 elementary school nurses, 37 \n        percent reported having at least 10 students with severe food \n        allergies and 62 percent reported having at least 5.\n            (4) Forty-four percent of the elementary school nurses \n        surveyed reported that the number of students in their school \n        with food allergy had increased over the past 5 years, while \n        only 2 percent reported a decrease.\n            (5) In a 2001 study of 32 fatal food-allergy induced \n        anaphylactic reactions (the largest study of its kind to date), \n        more than half (53 percent) of the individuals were aged 18 or \n        younger.\n            (6) Eight foods account for 90 percent of all food-allergic \n        reactions: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, \n        wheat, and soy.\n            (7) Currently, there is no cure for food allergies; strict \n        avoidance of the offending food is the only way to prevent a \n        reaction.\n            (8) Anaphylaxis is a systemic allergic reaction that can \n        kill within minutes.\n            (9) Food-allergic reactions are the leading cause of \n        anaphylaxis outside the hospital setting, accounting for an \n        estimated 30,000 emergency room visits, 2,000 hospitalizations, \n        and 150 to 200 deaths each year in the United States.\n            (10) Fatalities from anaphylaxis are associated with a \n        delay in the administration of epinephrine (adrenaline), or \n        when epinephrine was not administered at all. In a study of 13 \n        food allergy-induced anaphylactic reactions in school-age \n        children (6 fatal and 7 near fatal), only 2 of the children who \n        died received epinephrine within 1 hour of ingesting the \n        allergen, and all but 1 of the children who survived received \n        epinephrine within 30 minutes.\n            (11) The importance of managing life-threatening food \n        allergies in the school setting has been recognized by the \n        American Medical Association, the American Academy of \n        Pediatrics, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and \n        Immunology, the American College of Allergy, Asthma and \n        Immunology, and the National Association of School Nurses.\n            (12) There are no Federal guidelines concerning the \n        management of life-threatening food allergies in the school \n        setting.\n            (13) Three-quarters of the elementary school nurses \n        surveyed reported developing their own training guidelines.\n            (14) Relatively few schools actually employ a full-time \n        school nurse. Many are forced to cover more than 1 school, and \n        are often in charge of hundreds if not thousands of students.\n            (15) Parents of students with severe food allergies often \n        face entirely different food allergy management approaches when \n        their students change schools or school districts.\n            (16) In a study of food allergy reactions in schools and \n        day-care settings, delays in treatment were attributed to a \n        failure to follow emergency plans, calling parents instead of \n        administering emergency medications, and an inability to \n        administer epinephrine.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) ESEA definitions.--The terms ``local educational \n        agency'', ``secondary school'', and ``elementary school'' have \n        the meanings given the terms in section 9101 of the Elementary \n        and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).\n            (2) School.--The term ``school'' includes public--\n                    (A) kindergartens;\n                    (B) elementary schools; and\n                    (C) secondary schools.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the \n        Secretary of Education.\n\nSEC. 4.

      "document": "we report a male child diagnosed with bilateral choroidal osteoma , high myopia and secondary choroidal neovascularization ( cnv ) membrane in one eye . \n co - existence of posterior staphyloma made the clinical diagnosis of choroidal osteoma difficult due to the osteoma filling the depression of the posterior staphyloma . \n on review of the literature we were unable to find a similar case of co - existant choroidal osteoma and posterior staphyloma reported earlier . \n this case highlights the need for careful examination when presented with a case of choroidal osteoma filling the depression of a posterior staphyloma thereby making it appear flat rather than a typical elevated lesion . \n we report a case of bilateral choroidal osteoma - macular in the right eye and peripapillary with macular involvement in the left eye along with high myopia and posterior staphyloma in a male child associated with a cnv membrane in the left eye treated with the off - label use of intravitreal bevacizumab ( avastin ; genentech , san francisco , ca , usa ) . \n a 10-year - old male patient presented with the complaints of decreased vision in the left eye for the last 4 days . on examination , the best corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) in the right eye was 20/40 , n6 and in the left eye 20/100 , n9 . \n anterior segment examination was normal and the fundus examination of both eyes showed myopic discs with a posterior staphyloma and an extensive orangish - yellow flat lesion in the macular area of the right eye and in the peripapillary and macular area with submacular hemorrhage in the left eye [ figure 1a and b ] . \n ( a ) color fundus photo of the right eye showing an orangish - yellow lesion in the macular area suggestive of a choroidal osteoma ( b ) color fundus photo of the left eye showing the choroidal osteoma with submacular hemorrhage and choroidal neovascularization ultrasound b - scan of both eyes showed a high reflective echo with shadowing at the posterior pole of both eyes . \n patient underwent fundus fluorescein angiography ( ffa ) for both eyes which showed early hypofluorescence with late hyperfluorescence in the macular area of both eyes along with the peripapillary area in the left eye suggestive of the choroidal osteoma . \n there was an area of early hyperfluorescence which increased in size and intensity in the macular area of the left eye suggestive of an active cnv [ figure 2a ] . \n the indocyanine green angiography showed macular choroidal hypofluorescence in both eyes with an ill - defined hyperfluorescence plaque seen in the delayed frames of the left eye suggestive of a cnv [ figure 2b ] . \n spectral domain optical coherence tomography of the left eye showed a steep curvature of the retinal layers due to posterior staphyloma along with a subfoveal cnv [ figure 3 ] . \n ( a ) fundus fluorescein angiography of the left eye showing an area of blocked fluorescence due to submacular hemorrhage and an area of hyperfluorescence within it suggestive of choroidal neovascularization ( b ) indocyanine green angiography of the left eye showing macular choroidal hypofluorescence with an ill - defined hyperfluorescent plaque seen in the delayed frames of the left eye suggestive of a choroidal neovascularization optical coherence tomography of the left eye showing increased curvature of the retinal layers due to posterior staphyloma along with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization he was diagnosed to have bilateral choroidal osteoma with an active subfoveal cnv in the left eye . \n he underwent a loading dose of three intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg/0.05 ml bevacizumab ( off - label use ) delivered to the inferotemporal quadrant of the left eye under strict aseptic precautions and short general anesthesia after an informed consent was signed by the parents . at 1 year follow - up after the last injection showed a bcva of 20/60 , n6 in the left eye . \n fundus examination of the left eye showed choroidal osteoma in the macula with no evidence of submacular hemorrhage . \n ffa of the left eye showed staining of the cnv with no evidence of dye leakage . \n choroidal osteoma is a relatively rare benign intraocular tumor composed of mature bone that typically replaces the full thickness of the choroid . \n this tumor classically manifests as an orange - yellow plaque deep to the retina in the juxtapapillary or macular region.1 nearly 80% are unilateral though gass has described unilateral osteomas becoming bilateral.2 these tumors are said to show signs of evolution - growth of tumor , decalcification and cnv formation causing profound visual loss . \n our patient has an osteoma involving the peripapillary and macular area , which is rare . \n we missed the diagnosis of the osteoma initially as the lesion appeared flat though the tumor is usually a little elevated . \n this was due to the tumor filling the depth of the co - existent posterior staphyloma . based on our experience \n we recommend other clinicians to remain suspicious for a similar presentation when examining a myopic fundus with a posterior staphyloma . \n there was a large area of submacular hemorrhage overlying the osteoma , which may predispose to the formation of cnv along with an irregular surface of the tumor.3 the possible reasons for the development of the cnv in these cases includes thin degenerated retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) overlying the osteoma allowing the growth of new blood vessels or an extension of the osteoma itself due to the presence of osteoclasts on histopathology.4 the various treatments for cnv secondary to a choroidal osteoma include laser photocoagulation , photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) , transpupillary thermotherapy ( ttt ) and surgical removal of the cnv . \n laser photocoagulation especially for an extrafoveal cnv with osteoma , was found to be poorly responsive to laser photocoagulation due to depigmentation of the rpe and degenerated rpe / bruch 's membrane complex , resulting in the reduced uptake of laser energy.5 pdt requires multiple treatments and there is a risk of a drop in vision after the treatment.6 visual results have been poor with ttt and surgical removal of the cnv associated with osteoma.47 ] in our case , the osteoma induced cnv was treated with a loading dose of three intravitreal bevacizumab injections ( off label use ) resulting in rapid regression of the cnv with a marked improvement in visual acuity . \n bevacizumab may have better penetration in these cases due to a very thinned and degenerated rpe / bruch 's membrane complex.8 there are reports of cnv secondary to choroidal osteoma in adult patients treated with intravitreal bevacizumab.89 however to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a choroidal osteoma induced cnv treated with bevacizumab in a young child .",

NBC's Brian Williams reports.\n\nBy Erin McClam, Staff Writer, NBC News\n\nA judge entered a plea of not guilty Tuesday for James Holmes, the man accused of massacring 12 people at a Batman movie last summer, and scheduled a one-month trial beginning in August.\n\nJudge William Sylvester of Colorado circuit court entered the plea after lawyers for Holmes said they were not ready to plead. The judge left the door open for lawyers to mount an insanity defense later.\n\nRJ Sangosti / Denver Post / Pool via AP\n\nJames Holmes, Aurora theater shooting suspect, sits in the courtroom during his arraignment in Centennial, Colo., on Tuesday, March 12, 2013.\n\nHolmes walked into the courtroom in Centennial, Colo., and locked eyes with his parents, who were sitting in the second row of the courtroom. He did not show any emotion.\n\nThe judge set an Aug. 5 trial date. Prosecutors will announce by April 1 whether they will seek the death penalty.\n\nThe judge ruled Monday that Holmes must waive medical confidentiality and agree to be drugged for a psychiatric exam if he wants to claim that he is not guilty by reason of insanity. His lawyers had claimed that those provisions violated his constitutional rights.\n\nSylvester ruled that Holmes would have to turn over the names, addresses and medical reports of any doctor or psychologist who has treated him for a psychiatric condition.\n\nThe defense claimed in papers revealed last week that Holmes was hospitalized for several days last fall and required restraints.\n\nTwelve people were killed and 70 injured in the July 20, 2012, shooting rampage at a midnight screening of the movie \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d in Aurora, Colo. Holmes surrendered to police within minutes of the attack.\n\nAt his first court appearances, Holmes had reddish-orange hair and a blank stare.

correlated with her severe respiratory symptoms , including orthopnea . \n the most common causes of death among patients with relapsing polychondritis are infection , airway compromise , and cardiac complications . \n deaths from infection are frequently associated with laryngotracheal disease and pneumonia as well as corticosteroid therapy . \n cardiovascular involvement , such as valvular disorders , aneurysmal dilatation of the great vessels and systemic vasculitis has been reported with relapsing polychondritis . \n unfortunately , valve replacement surgery does not offer good prognosis because of the progression of underlying connective tissue degeneration . \n physiotherapy has a favorable effect on mucociliary clearance and may be useful for conditioning patients before elective surgical interventions . a tracheostomy or surgical interventions , such as airway stenting , \n airway stenting leads to considerable improvement in airflow , particularly during expiration if the collapsing segment can be broadened by a stent . \n the anesthetic management of patients with relapsing polychondritis is challenging due to airway compromise , which is also one of the most causes of death in this disease . during induction of anesthesia , \n furthermore , after extubation , the potential for laryngeal obstruction may increase due to swelling , edema , and tissue injury of tracheal cartilage . \n tanaka et al .   reported a case of relapsing polychondritis that underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia . \n after extubation , the patient showed no respiratory complications and was discharged a few days later . \n however , there was a distinct difference in the severity of disease between this case and tanaka 's case , as the patient in tanaka 's case had only mild dyspnea on exertion and no tracheal stenosis on the ct scan . \n the patient in this report , in contrast , suffered from orthopnea for a few months and a ct scan revealed narrowing of the subglottic area of which the diameter was approximately 5.75 mm . \n , we had to consider the possibility of failure of intubation and/or extubation of the endotracheal tube due to airway compromise . even if intubation was able to be done , the risks of respiratory failure and reintubation after extubation were also high . due to the risk of glottal or subglottal mucosal swelling induced by endotracheal intubation , local and regional anesthesia may be considered safer for patients with relapsing polychondritis than general anesthesia . \n therefore , the possible side effects of endotracheal intubation should be weighed against its advantages and the expected procedure . in this case , the operation was converted from a laparoscopic surgery to an open laparotomy and was performed under epidural anesthesia after discussion with surgeon . \n these have included a reduction in neurohormonal response to surgical stimuli , preservation of spontaneous breathing and airway reflexes , decreased blood loss and postoperative pain , a reduced risk of thromboembolism , and a more rapid recovery of gastrointestinal motility . \n many studies have evaluated the usefulness of continuous epidural analgesia as the predominant anesthetic technique in abdominal surgery [ 10 - 12 ] . \n other studies demonstrated that the postoperative deterioration of respiratory function and pulmonary complications decreased with thoracic epidural analgesia compared to general anaesthesia in abdominal or breast surgery . in this case , thoracic epidural blockade provided appropriate analgesia . \n the patient felt sensations of nausea , discomfort or pain only when surgeons pulled on the mesentery or palpated the diaphragmatic surfaces of intraabdominal organs . \n instead , we infused remifentanil at a low rate instead of a sedative bolus in order to avoid respiratory depression and this was effective in reducing discomfort and pain . \n awareness of relapsing polychondritis , as a rare disorder , is significantly critical to conventional general anesthesia because dynamic airway collapse can occur . \n we were able to put a patient with severe relapsing polychondritis for wedge resection of stomach under thoracic epidural analgesia and found no specific complications as a result thereof . \n thus , we present that thoracic epidural analgesia can be safely utilized as an anesthetic technique for patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery with airway difficulties , reduced pulmonary function , or weak respiratory muscles due to neuromuscular disease .",
      "summary": "relapsing polychondritis is a rare disease characterized by progressive inflammation and destruction of cartilaginous structures such as ears , nose , and tracheolaryngeal structures . as a result , \n tracheolaryngeal involvement makes anesthetic management a challenge . \n anesthetic management of a patient with relapsing polychondritis may encounter airway problems caused by severe tracheal stenosis . \n we present the case of a 60-year - old woman with relapsing polychondritis who underwent wedge resection of the stomach under epidural analgesia . \n thoracic epidural blockade of the t4 - 10 dermatome was achieved by epidural injection of 7 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine and 50 g of fentanyl . \n the patient was tolerable during the operation . \n we suggest that epidural analgesia may be an alternative to general anesthesia for patients with relapsing polychondritis undergoing upper abdominal surgery .",

p  =  0.01 ) and bdg  +  scd14 ( spearman r  =  0.58 , p  <  0.01 ) were the most promising combinations of 2 biomarkers , whereas the combination of all 3 biomarkers ( bdg  +  il-8  +  scd14 ) had the highest correlation with gds ( spearman r  =  0.71 ; p  <  0.01 ) . \n plasma bdg levels , levels of other biomarkers including combinations , as well as spearman correlations with blood bdg and gds are displayed in table 2 . using the plasma bdg \n cut - off recommended by the manufacturer for differentiating negative from intermediate and positive results ( ie of 60  pg / ml ) , the sensitivity for detecting neurocognitive impairment was 78% and the specificity 50% . if bdg cut - off \n was increased to 70  pg / ml , the sensitivity dropped to 44% , but specificity increased to 90% . \n two of 16 csf samples presented elevated bdg levels ( 45 and 53  pg / ml ; figure 1 ) , whereas all other samples had bdg levels < 10  pg / ml . \n interestingly , these 2 samples originated for the 2 subjects with the highest gds scores of the cohort . both of these subjects had also elevated serum bdg levels ( 4 and 5 highest of the study cohort ) and no signs or symptoms of opportunistic infections . \n this study correlated blood levels of the fungal polysaccharide cell wall component bdg , with cognition among hiv - infected patients . identifying biomarkers associated with worse neurocognitive functioning among successfully treated hiv - infected individual \n overall , our study cohort of hiv - infected individuals with suppressed hiv rna viral loads presented with markedly higher bdg levels when compared to previously published levels from healthy patients undergoing elective plastic surgery procedures . \n our study also showed , for the first time , that elevated bdg levels in the absence of fungal infections were associated with negative neurocognitive outcomes ( as measured by increased gds ) in virologically suppressed hiv - infected persons who started art during early hiv infection . \n interestingly , gds was also correlated with il-8 , but bdg and il-8 were not correlated . \n importantly , combining bdg with il-8 and especially the combination of all 3 plasma biomarkers ( bdg , il-8 , and scd 14 ) further improved the correlation with gds . \n we hypothesize that elevated plasma bdg may primarily reflect translocation of products from natural fungal flora from the gastrointestinal tract into systemic circulation . \n evidence of peripheral fungal cell wall polysaccharides in the systemic circulation has also been reported previously in an hiv - infected outpatient cohort , the majority of whom had measurable hiv rna in their blood . in that study , \n high serum bdg was associated with hiv - associated immunosuppression ( ie , cd4 cell counts < 200  cells/l ) , inflammation ( correlation with plasma il-8 and other inflammation markers ) , and cardiopulmonary comorbidity . together with these previous findings , \n our results support a theory that bdg translocation occurs in virologically suppressed hiv+ individuals and may relate to important outcomes such as nc impairment . \n bdg levels were markedly higher ( mean 142  pg / ml ) in a hiv - infected cohort with lower median cd4 counts ( 26 , iqr 1053 , all without opportunistic infections ) , when compared with the cohort studied here ( with a median cd4 count > 700  pg / ml ) . in contrast , lower bdg levels ( median 15  pg / ml ) were found in another study that evaluated chronically hiv - infected individuals with a median duration of hiv infection of 15 years and high cd4 + counts ( 643 , range 1961740 ) . \n although elevated blood bdg levels may be associated with microbial translocation in all hiv - infected individuals ( ie , independent of cd4 cell counts ) , interpretation of elevated blood bdg levels in patients with cd4 cell counts below 200 to 300  cells/l may be more complicated . \n although it seems intuitive that deteriorating cd4 counts are associated with worse mucosal barrier function , other reasons for elevated bdg may include potential colonization or subclinical infection with candida spp or pneumocystis that may occur more frequently in individuals with lower cd4 counts . \n other studies suggested that bdg may also be elevated in bloodstream infections caused by primarily enteric bacteria , such as enterococcus spp , whereas in a recent study , bdg was not elevated ( i.e. >  80  pg / ml ) in patients with mild - to - moderate mucositis . whether this increase in bdg levels reflects concomitant translocation of fungal elements , \n major limitations of this pilot study include the small sample size , that it is single - site , cross - sectional , and restricted to patients treated in early stages of hiv infection . to further examine the role of bdg as a potential biomarker for translocation of gut luminal contents and its correlation with neurocognitive impairment \n bdg levels in the intestinal luminal contents are also likely to be highly variable on an individual basis , and a standardized oral bdg challenge approach may be more suitable for assessing gut leakiness . \n longitudinal studies are also needed to investigate the mechanisms of blood bdg increase in individuals with translocation of gut microbes or their components . in conclusion \n , bdg may be an indicator of gut mucosal barrier disruption and an independent biomarker associated with neurocognitive functioning in virologically suppressed hiv - infected individuals with high cd4 counts . \n in particular , when bdg is combined with established markers of immune activation , diagnostic potential for neurocognitive functioning may be promising .",

      "document": "certain parts of the alveolar ridge are sensitive to the pressure of hard prosthetic materials , due to thin overlying mucosa.1 when the shock absorbing behaviour of mucosa is diminished , masticatory impact forces are directly transmitted to the underlying tissue . as a result , there is an increased burden on the residual ridges.2 soft lining materials are able to form an absorbing layer on the part of denture in contact with the oral mucosa and this allows less traumatic occlusal force transmission.1 these properties make soft denture lining materials useful for treating patients with ridge atrophy or resorption , bony undercuts , bruxing tendencies , congenital or acquired oral defects , xerostomia and dentures opposing natural dentition.3 the result is that wearing the complete prosthesis becomes more comfortable for the patient . \n contemporary elastic materials are used for short and long term application in the oral cavity and are divided into acrylic and silicone types . \n depending upon polymerization techniques , these can be further divided into room temperature and high temperature polymerizing resilient denture liners.1 the resilient lining materials present problems during clinical use , such as weakening of bond between lining and denture , loss of resiliency , colour alterations , and porosity . \n the loss of resiliency may be due to the leaching out of the plasticizer and other components.4 simultaneously water is absorbed until equilibrium is reached thereby , increasing surface roughness of the resilient denture liners.5 it has been seen that rougher surfaces enhance adhesion of microorganisms onto resilient lining materials and may allow fungal growth.6 patients using removable prosthetic restorations lined with an elastic material should , therefore , carry out regular cleansing procedures to prevent such infection.1 denture plaque control using mechanical and chemical methods is essential for maintenance of good oral hygiene of denture wearers.7 however , mechanical cleansing ( brushing ) is not advisable for soft denture liners since it can damage the resilient lining.8 chemical cleansing by denture cleansers is the first choice for denture plaque control of tissue conditioners.7 the solutions used for denture cleaning can be divided according to their chemical composition : alkaline peroxide , alkaline hypochlorites , acids , disinfectants and enzymes . \n peroxide cleansers are the most commonly used denture cleansers.9 they are dispensed in powder or tablets forms , which become alkaline solutions of hydrogen peroxide when dissolved in water.10 hypochlorites are useful as denture cleansers because they remove stains , dissolve mucin and other organic substances and are bactericidal and fungicidal . \n this study was aimed to determine the effect of two chemically distinct denture cleansers and water on the surface hardness of acrylic and silicone based soft denture liners at various time intervals . \n the study was conducted in maharishi markandeshwar college of dental sciences and research , mullana , ambala , haryana , india . \n two commonly used commercial resilient liner materials , based on their chemical composition ( silicone- and acrylic - based soft liners ) were selected for the study . \n total of hundred and twenty cylindrical specimens were made of the dimensions 15 mm  10 mm ( according to astm : d-2240 - 64t)3 with the help of a custom made metal mold ( fig . \n base of the mold was placed on a glass slab covered with cellophane sheet to facilitate separation of mold from the glass slab . \n soft denture liners were manipulated according to manufacturer 's instructions and expressed into the mold ( fig . \n the mold was then covered from the top by a cellophane sheet and another glass slab was pressed tightly against the mold to remove excess material and to shape the specimens according to the dimensions of the mold . \n once the material was set , the specimens were removed from the mold and excess was trimmed using a bp blade . \n group a ( control ) , group b ( sodium hypochlorite ) and group c ( sodium perborate ) comprising of 40 specimens each ( fig . \n each group was divided further into 4 subgroups : subgroup i , ii , iii and iv ( consisted of 10 specimens each ) to be tested at a time interval of 1 week , 1 month , 3 months and 6 months respectively . \n each subgroup was again divided into two minor subgroups : minor subgroup a - consisted samples made of acrylic based soft denture liner and minor subgroup b - consisted of samples made of silicone based soft denture liner ( table 2 ) . \n specimen in group a ( control ) were cleansed daily by rinsing with water and then were stored in artificial saliva for the entire period of the study . \n specimens in group b were immersed in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for ten minutes daily , rinsed in water and stored in artificial saliva at room temperature . \n specimens in group c were cleansed in a solution of sodium perborate denture cleansing tablets ( dissolved in 250 ml water as recommended by the manufacturer ) . \n specimens of all 3 groups were tested at 1 week , 1 month , 3 months and 6 months time interval at central institute of plastics engineering & technology ( cipet ) , panipat , haryana . \n the specimens were tested using a shore a durometer which was calibrated in accordance with astm d-2240 under the spring force of 822 gf ( 8.06 n ) ( fig . \n three readings were noted for each sample and the mean of those readings was taken ( table 3 ) . \n these readings were then subjected to one - way anova , post hoc test and pair - t test for statistical analysis . \n insignificant differences were observed in mean values of surface hardness of samples for all groups after 1 week . \n after 1 month highly significant changes were noted in surface hardness for acrylic samples when mean values for control group are compared to those of sodium hypochlorite group and sodium perborate group . \n insignificant differences were seen in mean values between sodium hypochlorite and sodium perborate group . for silicone samples \n insignificant differences were seen in mean values of surface hardness between all groups at 1 month . at 3 months \n insignificant differences in mean values of surface hardness were seen for all groups . at 6 months \n insignificant differences in mean values of surface hardness of samples were seen for acrylic samples . for silicone based soft denture liners \n insignificant differences were seen in mean values of surface hardness of samples for all groups except between sodium hypochlorite and control group , which showed highly significant difference in mean values ( table 4 ) . in control group differences seen in mean values for surface hardness of acrylic samples at all time intervals were very significant , except between 1 week and 1 month . \n also highly significant changes were noted for mean values of surface hardness of acrylic samples at all time intervals in sodium hypochlorite and sodium perborate group ( table 5 ) . \n silicone samples in control group showed no significant differences in mean values for surface hardness between 1 week , 1 month and 3 months . \n highly significant differences were seen between means of 6 months when compared to 1 week , 1 month and 3 months . in sodium \n hypochlorite group , differences in mean values were insignificant between 1 week and 1 month , and 1 month and 3 months . \n highly significant differences were seen between 1 week and 3 months . at 6 months , results were highly significant in comparison to 1 week , 1 month and 3 months . in sodium \n perborate group mean values for silicone samples showed insignificant differences between 1 week and 1 month . \n statistically significant differences were seen in mean values between all other time intervals ( table 5 ) . \n comparative evaluation between silicone and acrylic samples revealed insignificant differences in mean values for surface hardness of acrylic - based and silicone - based soft denture liners in control group at 1 week . at 3 months and at 6 months \n highly significant differences were seen in mean values of acrylic - based and silicone - based soft denture liners in all groups indicating much better performance of silicone - based soft liners after 6 months ( table 6 ) . \n currently the most commonly used materials are plasticized acrylics and silicone rubber which are either chemically or heat polymerized.10 silicone rubber material is composed of dimethyl siloxane polymer which is a viscous liquid , cross linked to provide good elastic properties . \n these materials excel in their resiliencies , whereas , acrylic soft resin materials are acrylic co - polymers to which plasticizers may be added . \n these materials may absorb water , swell and harden because of plasticizer leaching.11 this hypothesis is supported by hadary and drummond12 who evaluated two soft denture lining materials with distinct chemical composition to determine whether compositional variations manifest themselves in property differences . \n the results revealed that acrylic - based soft liner had higher solubility and sorption than silicone - based and on this basis concluded that silicone based products may provide better clinical success . \n denture plaque control using mechanical and chemical methods is essential for maintenance of good oral hygiene of denture wearers . \n it has been reported that soft denture liners can be deeply penetrated by candida albicans.6 brushing ( mechanical plaque control ) is not advisable for resilient denture liners , because it can damage the resilient lining.9 furthermore , ultrasonic treatment is not effective for removal of denture plaque7 . \n this is supported by hermann et al.13 who in their study observed that mechanical brushing promoted wear abrasion of soft liners . \n only chemical treatment by denture cleansers can be applied to such soft material.6 alkaline peroxide ( or sodium perborate ) and sodium hypochlorite denture cleansers are the most commonly used denture cleansers . \n alkaline peroxide cleansers are commercially available as powder or tablets which become alkaline solutions of hydrogen peroxide when immersed in water . \n sara et al.14 studied the effectiveness of denture cleansers on soft denture liners and concluded that sodium perborate denture cleanser proved to be most effective . \n hypochlorites are known to have bactericidal and fungicial property and act on stains , dissolve mucin and other organic substances.10 de freitas fernandes et al.15 and ferreira et al.16 in their study concluded that the best results were found for the treatment with 0.5% naocl for 10 minutes in comparison to other cleansers . the present study was conducted for determining and comparing surface hardness of one silicone - based and one acrylic - based soft denture liner over a period of 6 months when cleansed daily . in control group , \n silicone - based soft denture liners have shown a few changes in surface hardness for the first 3 months but highly significant changes were observed in surface hardness at 6 months , whereas , acrylic - based soft denture liners showed minor changes in surface hardness for 1 month , after which they showed significant increase in surface hardness at all time intervals . \n these results are supported by mese and guzel5 who evaluated the effect of storage duration on the hardness and tensile bond strength of 2 acrylic resin - based and 2 silicone - based resilient liners . \n they concluded that after 6 months hardness values of all resilient liners evaluated were higher with increased duration of immersion . \n the hardness values of acrylic resin - based liners showed greater change than those of silicone products . in sodium \n hypochlorite group , highly significant increase in surface hardness was noticed for acrylic samples for all time intervals . in case of silicone samples , increase in surface hardness \n was insignificant between 1 week and 1 month , and 1 month and 3 months , however , highly significant changes were seen between 1 week and 3 months . at 6 months results \n were highly significant in comparison to 1 week , 1 month and 3 months . in sodium perborate group , \n acrylic - based soft liners showed highly significant increase in surface hardness at all time intervals . in case of silicone samples \n highly significant increase in surface hardness was seen at all other time intervals at 1 week , all samples showed insignificant change in surface hardness for control , sodium hypochlorite and sodium perborate group . at 1 month sodium hypochlorite and sodium perborate were seen to have highly significant affect on surface hardness of acrylic samples as compared to control group , whereas , silicone based soft liners showed insignificant changes in surface hardness in control , sodium hypochlorite and sodium perborate group . \n this result is supported by the findings of broek et al.1 who determined the effect of storage in disinfectants and artificial saliva on a series of commercial soft lining materials for dentures . \n it was observed that the acrylic materials became less elastic on storage for up to 28 days whereas the silicone materials showed no change in elastic properties , irrespective of cleansing treatment . at 3 months \n , no significant change was seen in surface hardness values of acrylic and silicone samples for control , sodium hypochlorite and sodium perborate group , but at 6 months sodium hypochlorite has shown highly significant increase in surface hardness of silicone samples in comparison to control group , whereas , sodium perborate has not shown any significant changes in comparison to control group and sodium hypochlorite group . in case of acrylic based soft denture liners , \n these results are supported by goll et al.17 who in their study concluded that sodium hypochlorite denture cleansers caused more damage to surface properties of soft liners than sodium perborate denture cleansers . \n the present study is also in accordance with the study conducted by mante et al.18 who evaluated in vitro changes in hardness of four sealed resilient lining materials and revealed that immersion in alkaline peroxide denture cleanser showed only a mild effect on the hardness of the soft reline agents . \n acrylic based soft liners showed highly significant increase in surface hardness than silicone - based soft liners for sodium hypochlorite and sodium perborate groups , but , no significant differences were observed for control group at 1 week and 1 month . \n after 3 months and 6 months , among both the soft liners tested in the study , silicone -based soft liners performed significantly better than acrylic - based soft liners for all groups . \n similar results were obtained in study by mancuso et al.19 tested hardness and color stability of liner materials based on acrylic resin and silicone after 2000 thermal cycles . \n it was concluded that hardness of silicone soft liners was less affected than acrylic resin - based liners . \n all the materials tested in the study showed an increase in surface hardness with time irrespective of the cleansing method . \n however , no significant difference was observed among control , sodium hypochlorite and sodium perborate groups . \n overall results indicated that silicone - based soft denture liners performed significantly better than acrylic - based soft denture liners . \n the nutrient - rich environment of the oral cavity does not fully match the in vitro nature of the present study . \n therefore , the behavior of denture lining materials in this study may only partially predict the clinical performance . \n despite increasing usage of soft liners in prosthetic dentistry and the importance of cleansing to prevent cross contamination , factors such as absorption and solubility , roughness , bond strength , color stability and viscoelastic properties need to be further investigated to define the best cleansing procedure for these materials . \n within the limitations of this study , it can be concluded that chemical denture cleansers can be used daily to cleanse soft denture liners without adversely affecting their surface hardness . \n silicone - based soft liners showed better compatibility with cleansing solutions and maintained their resiliency better thereby , proving to be more promising for long term usage .",

off threshold of td ratio could be used . \n several studies have evaluated the bronchial wall thickness in human medicine . since bronchial wall thickness \n can be changed according to airway generation , we \n calculated the ratios of bronchial and arterial dimensions rather than their absolute values . \n one of the ratios was the td ratio which was dividing bronchial wall \n thickness by the whole diameter of bronchus . \n the percentage of wall area ( wa% ) has also been used in the quantification of bronchial wall thickness in human \n asthma patients . in the case of bronchiectasis \n , simple measurement of bronchial wall thickness divided by bronchial luminal diameter could cause spurious \n underestimation of intrinsic bronchial wall thickening . \n thus , to obtain an estimation of bronchial wall thickness , we used ta ratio , which was the ratio of mean \n bronchial wall thickness divided by mean diameter of the accompanying pulmonary artery used previously . as a result , we found that the ta ratio was more \n accurate than td ratio . in human medicine , many studies have reported of correlation between the severity of asthma and images of bronchial changes in hrct . \n the forced expiratory volume \n in one second ( fev1 ) has been reported to be correlated with wa% . \n td ratio and wa% have been reported to be negatively correlated with carbon monoxide transfer \n coefficient . in veterinary medicine , bronchial wall thickness ratios will be helpful to assess the severity of feline asthma , because it is quantitative . \n however , indexing for the severity of asthma , such as fev1 , in human medicine has not been established in veterinary medicine . \n furthermore , the breed of cats used in this study was not diverse . therefore , it was difficult to \n compare difference between breeds . \n research studies are needed to determine the differences in normal ranges of bronchial wall for a variety of feline breeds . for \n example \n , in brachycephalic breed cat , such as persian cat , bronchial wall can be thicker than other breeds , even though there is no clinical sign . \n dogs with \n brachycephalic airway syndrome may contribute to the loss of small airway wall rigidity . \n based on this finding , the ba ratio in brachycephalic breed dogs is \n found to be different from that in non - brachycephalic dogs . in persian cat , brachycephalic syndrome including stenotic nares and elongated soft palate has \n been reported . \n for the first time , this study reported the evaluation of bronchial wall thickness of normal cats and clinically asthmatic cats using hrct . \n our results suggest \n that quantification indices of bronchial wall thickness , such as td ratio and ta ratio , can be used to diagnose feline asthma syndrome and other diseases \n involving bronchial wall thickening . in conclusion \n , hrct is a useful modality to quantify bronchial wall thickness to diagnose diseases involving the thickening \n of bronchial wall , including feline asthma .",

      "document": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Motor Vehicle Owners' Right to \nRepair Act of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The ability to diagnose, service, and repair a motor \n        vehicle in a timely, reliable, and affordable manner is \n        essential to the safety and well-being of automotive consumers \n        in the United States.\n            (2) Consumers are entitled to choose among competing repair \n        facilities for the convenient, reliable, and affordable repair \n        of their motor vehicles.\n            (3) Increased competition among repair facilities will \n        benefit vehicle owners in the United States.\n            (4) Computers of various kinds are increasingly being used \n        in motor vehicle systems, such as pollution control, \n        transmission, anti-lock brakes, electronic and mechanical \n        systems, heating and air-conditioning, mobile electronics, \n        airbags, and steering.\n            (5) The diagnosis, service, and repair of these vehicle \n        systems are essential to the safety and proper operation of \n        modern motor vehicles.\n            (6) In many instances, access codes prevent owners from \n        making, or having made, the necessary diagnosis, service, and \n        repair of their motor vehicles in a timely, convenient, \n        reliable, and affordable manner.\n            (7) Automobile manufacturers have restricted access to the \n        information motor vehicle owners need in order to diagnose, \n        service, and repair their vehicles, in a manner that has \n        hindered open competition among repair facilities.\n            (8) Consumers in the United States have benefited from the \n        availability of a competitive aftermarket industry, or parts \n        and accessories used in the repair, maintenance, or enhancement \n        of a motor vehicle. The American economy has also benefited \n        from the availability of a competitive aftermarket industry \n        that provides jobs to over 5 million workers in over 495,000 \n        businesses, and generates $200 billion in annual sales.\n            (9) Vehicle owners in the United States should have the \n        right--\n                    (A) to all information necessary to allow the \n                diagnosis, service, and repair of their vehicles;\n                    (B) to choose between original parts and \n                aftermarket parts when repairing their motor vehicles; \n                and\n                    (C) to make, or have made, repairs necessary to \n                keep their vehicles in reasonably good and serviceable \n                condition during the life of the vehicle.\n            (10) The restriction of vehicle repair information and \n        tools limits who can repair motor vehicles and what parts may \n        be used to repair those vehicles, which limits consumer choice, \n        impedes competition, and increases the costs of vehicle repair \n        for consumers.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are:\n            (1) To ensure the safety of all vehicle owners by requiring \n        disclosure of all information necessary for the proper \n        diagnosis, service, and repair of a vehicle in a timely, \n        affordable, and reliable manner.\n            (2) To encourage competition in the diagnosis, service, and \n        repair of motor vehicles.\n\nSEC. 3. MANUFACTURER DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Duty to Disclose.--The manufacturer of a motor vehicle sold or \nintroduced into commerce in the United States shall promptly provide to \nthe vehicle owner, or to a repair facility of the motor vehicle owner's \nchoosing, the information necessary to diagnose, service, or repair the \nvehicle. The motor vehicle manufacturer shall make available all non-\nemission-related service information, training information, and \ndiagnostic tools on a non-discriminatory basis to any repair facility \nof the owner's choosing, and shall not not limit such information to \nthose repair facilities within the manufacturers' approved network. The \ninformation to be made available shall include the following:\n            (1) The same service and training information related to \n        vehicle repair shall be made available to all independent \n        repair facilities in the same manner and extent as it is made \n        available to franchised dealerships, and shall include all \n        information needed to activate all controls that can be \n        activated by a franchised dealership.\n            (2) The same diagnostic tools and capabilities related to \n        vehicle repair that are made available to franchised \n        dealerships shall be made available to independent repair \n        facilities. These diagnostic tools and capabilities shall be \n        made available for purchase by motor vehicle owners or their \n        agents through reasonable business means. The service and \n        training information and manufacturer diagnostic capabilities \n        shall be available to independent repair facilities, and to the \n        companies from which they normally purchase diagnostic tools, \n        without the need for the motor vehicle owner to return to a \n        franchised dealership.\n    (b) Protection of Trade Secrets.--Nothing in this Act shall be \ndeemed to require the disclosure of trade secrets, nor the public \ndisclosure of any information related exclusively to the design and \nmanufacture of motor vehicle parts. No information necessary to repair \na vehicle shall be withheld by a manufacturer if such information is \nprovided (directly or indirectly) to franchised dealerships or other \nrepair facilities.\n\nSEC. 4. REGULATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Federal Trade Commission shall prescribe regulations \nsetting forth an appropriate method by which manufacturers shall \nprovide the information required by section 3, including disclosure in \nwriting, via the Internet, or under such terms as the Commission \ndetermines appropriate. The regulations shall take effect upon final \nissuance of such regulations and shall apply to vehicles manufactured \nafter model year 1994.\n    (b) Limitation.--The Federal Trade Commission may not prescribe \nrules that interfere with the authority of, or conflict with rules \nprescribed by, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \nunder section 202(m) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521(m)) with \nregard to motor vehicle emissions control diagnostics systems.\n\nSEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    (a) Unfair or Deceptive Act or Practice.--The failure by a \nmanufacturer to comply with section 3(a) or the regulations prescribed \nunder section 4 shall be treated as an unfair method of competition and \nan unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce (within \nthe meaning of section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 \nU.S.C. 45(a)(1))). A violation of this Act shall be treated as a \nviolation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice \nprescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission \nAct (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).\n    (b) Actions by the Federal Trade Commission.--The Federal Trade \nCommission shall enforce this Act in the same manner, by the same \nmeans, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all \napplicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 \nU.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated into and made a part of this Act. \nAny entity that violates this Act shall be subject to the penalties and \nentitled to the privileges and immunities provided in the Federal Trade \nCommission Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with the same \njurisdiction, power, and duties as though all applicable terms and \nprovisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated into \nand made a part of this Act.\n    (c) Effect on Other Laws.--Nothing contained in this Act shall be \nconstrued to limit the authority of the Federal Trade Commission under \nany other provisions of law.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The terms ``manufacturer'', ``motor vehicle'', and \n        ``motor vehicle equipment'' have the meanings given those terms \n        in section 30102(a) of title 49, United States Code.\n            (2) The term ``motor vehicle owner'' or ``vehicle owner'' \n        means any person who owns, leases, or otherwise has the legal \n        right to use and possess a motor vehicle.\n            (3) The term ``repair facility'' means a facility \n        maintained by a person engaged in the repair, diagnosing, or \n        servicing of motor vehicles or motor vehicle engines.",

A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month.\n\nLee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.\n\n\"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"",

      "document": " \n periampullary diverticula ( pad ) refer to extraluminal outpouchings of duodenal mucosa that develop within the radius of 2 to 3 cm from the ampulla of vater ( 1 ) . \n pad are largely asymptomatic but they sometimes can cause both pancreaticobiliary and non - pancreaticobiliary complications . rarely , obstructive jaundice can develop secondary to pad in the absence of choledocholithiasis or tumor and is termed lemmel 's syndrome ( 2 ) . \n recently , the authors experienced an unusual case of abdominal pain and obstructive jaundice due to extrinsic compression of mid common bile duct ( cbd ) by distended pad filled with pus - like material as a result of impacted intradiverticular enterolith at the pad orifice . \n an 81-yr - old woman presented to the emergency department on august 3 , 2012 with nausea , vomiting , fever ( 38.4 ) , and diffuse abdominal pain of 4 days ' duration . \n she had undergone subtotal gastrectomy with billroth ii anastomosis due to peptic ulcer perforation 10 yr ago . on physical examination \n , there was tenderness on her right upper quadrant but murphy 's sign was equivocal . her white blood count was increased to 11,170/l ( neutrophil 83.0% ) and crp was elevated to 2.392 mg / dl . the results of her liver function test were as follows : total bilirubin , 2.37 mg / dl ; aspartate aminotransferase , 88 \n iu / l ; alkaline phosphatase , 349 iu / l ; and -glutamyl transpeptidase , 571 iu / l . to evaluate the cause of diffuse abdominal pain with liver enzyme elevation in a cholestatic pattern , abdominal ct scan was taken . \n the axial images of the ct scan demonstrated distal cbd stone with upstream bile duct dilatation ( fig . \n however , on coronal reconstructed images , the stone was not located within the bile duct but inside the pad and the distended diverticulum was compressing the mid cbd ( fig . \n 1b , 1c ) . magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( mrcp ) also revealed mid cbd compression and absence of choledocholithiasis ( fig . \n these findings were confirmed on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) which showed normal biliary orifice ( fig . \n 2a ) with impacted dark brown pigment stone ( henceforth enterolith ) at the pad orifice ( fig . \n when the enterolith was pushed into the diverticulum by cannulation catheter and contrast dye was injected ( fig . \n 2c , 3a ) , old blood clots and pus - like fluid gushed out from the opening ( fig . \n biliary cannulation combined with endoscopic sphincterotomy ( est ) was also performed to explore the cbd for other possible causes of obstructive jaundice but no stone , stricture or obstruction by tumor could be found . on endoscopic nasobiliary drainage ( enbd ) \n tubogram , stenosis at mid cbd was also shown to be resolved , likely because the pad had been decompressed ( fig . \n 3b ) . after confirming that no other pathology was present , intradiverticular enterolith was crushed and removed by dormia basket on the following day ( fig . \n the patient no longer complained of abdominal pain , her liver enzyme was normalized , and she was discharged without any complication . \n she had been well until 6 months after enterolith removal , when the patient visited the outpatient clinic with vague abdominal discomfort . \n laboratory examination only revealed slightly increased total bilirubin to 1.96 mg / dl , but a large cbd stone was found on abdominal ct scan ( fig . \n when the cbd stone was removed by ercp , the stone proved to be brown pigment sludge stone that typically forms in the presence of ascending infection ( fig . \n follow - up ercp was performed again after 6 months but there was no recurrence of cbd stone or enterolith . \n diverticula of the gastrointestinal tract are outpouchings of all or part of the intestinal wall which can occur anywhere throughout the alimentary tract . \n the most common site of gastrointestinal diverticula is colon followed by duodenum , which was first described by chomel in 1710 ( 3 ) . \n the detection rate of duodenal diverticula ranges from 1% to 27% depending on the diagnostic modalities used and the average age at the time of diagnosis ( 1 ) . among duodenal diverticula \n , pad is the most common type comprising about 70% to 75% of all duodenal diverticula ( 1 ) . \n most pad are asymptomatic but complications can occur in about 5% of cases and they include bleeding , perforation , diverticulitis , pancreatitis , choledocholithiasis , cholangitis , jaundice , enterolith or bezoar formation , intestinal obstruction , etc . among these complications , \n hepatocholangiopancreatic disease can seldomly occur in the absence of choledocholithiasis and is termed lemmel 's syndrome ( 2 ) . \n first , diverticulitis or direct mechanical irritation of pad may cause chronic inflammation of ampulla and lead to chronic fibrosis of papilla ( papillitis chronica fibrosa ) ( 4 ) . \n third , distal cbd or ampulla can be directly compressed mechanically by pad that is usually filled with enterolith or bezoar ( 6 , 7 ) . in our case , \n enterolith that formed within the pad did not directly compress the distal cbd but it obstructed the pad orifice instead . \n this obstruction combined with inflammation of the diverticulum and collection of pus - like material within the obstructed pad seems to have expanded the pad with resultant extrinsic compression of mid cbd ( fig . \n therefore , the enterolith , bezoar , or food material within the pad is frequently evacuated and thus , the symptom could be intermittent . \n however , pad in our case had a narrow opening , likely due to repeated inflammation of the pad , and this seems to have hindered the clearance of entrapped enterolith out into the duodenal lumen . \n enterolith formation within the duodenal diverticula is known to be facilitated in the static environment such as a blind loop after gastrectomy or proximal portion of stricture formed by crohn 's disease or tuberculosis ( 8) . in our case , blind loop created by billroth ii anastomosis seems to have provided a static environment favoring enterolith formation within the pad . during enterolith removal \n , cbd was also explored to search for other possible source of obstructive jaundice such as cbd stone since primary biliary stone is known to occur more frequently in the presence of pad ( 9 , 10 ) . \n one possible mechanism behind increased occurrence of primary cbd stone in these patients involves colonization and overgrowth of -glucuronidase producing bacteria within the pad that spread into the bile duct , which in turn leads to deconjugation of bilirubin glucuronides and eventually results in precipitation of calcium bilirubinate gallstones ( 11 ) . \n although cbd was explored in our case , no other etiology of obstructive jaundice could be identified other than extrinsic compression by distended pad . however , primary bile duct stone newly developed on follow - up ercp performed 6 months later ( fig . \n the most plausible explanation is that est performed during cbd exploration at the time of enterolith removal has permitted the occurrence of ascending infection with resultant brown pigment stone formation . \n diagnosing lemmel 's syndrome could be challenging , but being aware of this condition is important to avoid mismanagement and it begins with identification of pad . \n scan and mrcp , pad appear as thin - walled cavitary lesions situated on the medial wall of the duodenum 2nd portion that typically contain gas . \n however , pad are sometimes filled with fluid and can frequently be mistaken for pancreatic pseudocyst , pancreatic abscess , cystic neoplasm in the pancreas head or even metastatic lymph node ( 12 , 13 ) . therefore , high index of suspicion is mandatory to arrive at a correct diagnosis in these patients . in our case , \n enterolith within the pad on axial images was at first mistaken for distal cbd stone due to its distal location combined with upstream dilatation of the bile duct ( fig . \n however , upon careful scrutinization of the coronal reconstructed images , it became evident that the stone was located within the pad ( fig . \n treatment is generally not recommended in asymptomatic patients or would be conservative management in pauci - symptomatic patients . nevertheless , since most patients with lemmel 's syndrome present with symptoms related to biliary obstruction ( i.e. jaundice , abdominal pain , and cholangitis ) as a result of extrinsic compression of cbd , some form of treatment is advocated . \n therapeutic options in this situation run the gamut from endoscopic extraction of entrapped material , extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to surgery ( diverticulectomy or biliodigestive anastomosis ) ( 7 , 14 , 15 ) . \n the patient in our case was also successfully treated endoscopically by fragmenting and removing enterolith using a dormia basket . \n it should be kept in mind that not all forms of lemmel 's syndrome are caused by extrinsic compression of cbd by bulging pad . \n if the underlying mechanism of lemmel 's syndrome is likely to be due to papillitis chronica fibrosa or sphincter of oddi dysfunction as mentioned above , the simplest and the most appropriate management would be to perform est ( 16 ) . in conclusion , lemmel 's syndrome is a rare cause of obstructive jaundice that should be included in the differential diagnosis of biliary obstruction when pad is present . maintaining a high index of suspicion is imperative to establish an accurate diagnosis since it can mimic other cystic or solid lesions around the pancreas head . \n symptomatic patient can be successfully managed endoscopically in many instances but recourse to surgical management would be necessary in selected cases .",
      "summary": "duodenal diverticula are detected in up to 27% of patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal tract evaluation with periampullary diverticula ( pad ) being the most common type . \n although pad usually do not cause symptoms , it can serve as a source of obstructive jaundice even when choledocholithiasis or tumor is not present . \n this duodenal diverticulum obstructive jaundice syndrome is called lemmel 's syndrome . \n an 81-yr - old woman came to the emergency room with obstructive jaundice and cholangitis . \n abdominal ct scan revealed stony opacity on distal cbd with cbd dilatation . \n ercp was performed to remove the stone . \n however , the stone was not located in the cbd but rather inside the pad . \n after removal of the enterolith within the pad , all her symptoms resolved . \n recognition of this condition is important since misdiagnosis could lead to mismanagement and therapeutic delay . \n lemmel 's syndrome should always be included as one of the differential diagnosis of obstructive jaundice when pad are present.graphical abstract",

( a ) plain radiograph revealing an osteolytic lesion involving the right proximal femur ( b ) mri showing altered signal intensity in the proximal metadiaphysis of right femur with abscesses and cortical breach ( c ) bone scan demonstrating increased tracer uptake in the metadiaphyseal region of right proximal femur bone scintigraphy with technetium 99 m methylene diphosphonate ( tc 99 m mdp ) demonstrated intense increase in tracer uptake in the proximal third of right femur with normal tracer distribution in rest of the skeleton , suggestive of an infective pathology [ figure 1c ] . \n intraoperatively , black discoloration of the right proximal femoral metaphysis with foul smelling discharge was noticed . \n the tissue was smeared with 10% koh solution and calcofluor white solution initially and then cultured in sabraoud 's dextrose agar ( sda ) and lactophenol cotton blue ( lpcb ) mount which revealed broad aseptate fungal hyphae suggestive of mucormycosis . \n histopathology of the cancellous bone and soft tissue exhibited large areas of necrosis and hemorrhage , replaced by inflammatory granulation tissue with dense infiltrates of lymphocytes , plasma cells , histiocytes , neutrophils , and few multinucleate giant cells . \n there were many broad , twisted , and few branching fungal filaments suggestive of mucormycosis [ figure 2 ] . \n histopathology with broad , twisted , and few branching fungal elements after the diagnosis of mucormycosis was confirmed , patient was evaluated for primary infection . \n there was no history of gastrointestinal infections and previous biopsy from gastric mucosa was negative . \n hence , primary source of infection could not be traced . in the immediate postoperative period , \n the patient developed pathological fracture at the same site and was put on skeletal traction for 19 days before definitive fixation . \n he was treated with liposomal amphotericin 3 mg / kg / day for 19 days , following which radical debridement of the lesion proceeded by skeletal stabilization with 95 condylar blade plate for the right proximal femur . \n considering the location of the pathological fracture ( proximal femur ) and the need for aggressive debridement and stable fixation , a 95 condylar blade plate fixation was achieved after adequate debridement . to prevent the usual complications of external fixation instead of infection such as pin tract infection , difficulty in mobilization and also considering adequate preoperative antifungal therapy and aggressive debridement , internal fixation was decided . \n 300 mg of fungitericin ( amphotericin b ) in powdered form was mixed with 40 g of simplex cement polymer and the mixture was then added with monomer , and while setting , cement beads were made into chains using stainless steel wire ( two strings with 15 beads each ) [ figure 3a ] . \n ( a ) postoperative plain radiograph with proximal femur stabilized with condylar blade plate and augmented with antifungal cement beads ( b ) three years followup plain radiograph with no evidence of osseous lesion with abundant callus intraoperatively , he had torrential blood loss amounting to 2.53 litres and went into hypovolemic shock . \n he was resuscitated with five units of packed red cells , eight units of cryoprecipitate , and eight units of fresh frozen plasma . \n radical debridement , inability to use the tourniquet , and difficulty in differentiating infected and uninfected marrow were the causes for unexpected blood loss . \n after aggressive debridement , bone to bone cortical contact was achieved for healing which led to loss of metaphyseal bone loss of 3 cm . \n postoperatively , liposomal amphotericin 3 mg / kg / day ( 180 mg / day ) was given for 3 weeks and downgraded to 1 mg / kg / day ( 60 mg / day ) for the next 9 weeks . \n patient had received a total dosage of 7560 mg of liposomal amphotericin for a total period of 12 weeks . \n he was advised postoperatively physiotherapy and toe - touch weight bearing crutch walking for 12 weeks . \n bone grafting was done along with beads removal and the tissue sent during surgery for histopathology and microbiological review was negative for mucormycosis . at 3-year followup \n , there was 3 cm limb shortening noticed for which a shoe raise was given . \n plain radiographs revealed healed fracture with no residual / recurrent lesion in the metadiaphysis region of right proximal femur [ figure 3b ] . \n the common predisposing factors are uncontrolled diabetes , hematological malignancies like leukemia , lymphoma , etc . , organ transplantation , severe burns , diseases like tuberculosis and aids , post bone marrow transplantation , neutropenia , renal failure , immunosuppressive medications , etc . \n mucormycosis has been described in various sites like cranium , hands , and feet , humerus , tibiae , femur , vertebrae , and joints.1 the etiopathogenesis of mucormycosis follows after entry into the host via ingestion , inoculation , or inhalation . in the immunocompromised host , \n the spores undergo angioinvasion leading to local necrosis and necrotizing infection , ultimately leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome , multiorgan dysfunction , and death . \n surgery includes radical debridement , mostly amputation , followed by high doses of amphotericin b. role of antifungal cement beads is limited mainly due to its cement elution properties and high local concentration leading to toxicity . \n multiple in vitro studies have reported amphotericin b impregnated pmma beads to have a successful role in the management of fungal infections.37 goss et al . in their study on elution and mechanical properties of amphotericin concluded that amphotericin was released from cement at a clinically insignificant level.8 \n in vitro studies on amphotericin beads have shown to provide adequate release of its concentration ( 1.75 - 2.0 microgm / ml ) up to 110 days from all bone cements.3 excessive local concentration of amphotericin b above 100 microgm / ml is lethal and concentration between 5 - 10microgm / ml causes abnormal morphology and reduced proliferation.4 of the seven cases of mucormycosis of tibia described in the literature , five were immunocompromised and 60% of those patients underwent amputation.9 the causes of amputation may be related to delayed diagnosis of mucormycosis , compromised immune status , inadequate debridement , or inadequate antifungal therapy . \n we present this case in view of the unusual site of presentation , limb - threatening osteomyelitis which was treated with radical debridement , liposomal amphotericin therapy , and using antifungal beads to enable limb salvage . \n high index of clinical suspicion , early diagnosis , aggressive debridement , and adequate liposomal amphotericin b are the key treatment modalities in the successful management of musculoskeletal mucormycosis .",

d. ct confirmed bladder mass on the right lateral bladder wall before bladder sparing treatment ( white arrow ) . \n bladder sparing treatment is considered as an important alternative treatment approach for mibc . nowadays , \n various modalities of bladder - sparing methods have been reported and investigated , among which pc with plnd after completeness of turbt plus chemotherapy or radiotherapy is regarded as a rational one . it was reported that the 5-year cancer specific survival rate after pc bladder sparing treatment ranges from 67% to 69% . although the 5-year survival rate of pc is comparable to radical cystectomy , and \n the quality of life for mibc patients have been greatly improved , this therapeutic approach has not yet been regarded as a standard treatment option for mibc because of lack of randomizedtrials . \n critics of pc also argued that the tumor recurrence rate after pc was relatively high , which ranged from 19% to 58% , and two - thirds of tumor recurrence appeared during the first 2 years . as a result , one important component of bladder sparing \n treatment modality was vigilant surveillance after surgery , because early detection of tumor recurrence resulted in excellent outcome of salvage radical cystectomy . \n however , the window to salvage cystectomy was short , and the disease carried a poor prognosis once patients developed extravesical disease caused by delayed diagnosis . \n regular cystoscopy and random biopsy of suspected lesion played a pivotal role in detecting early recurrence . \n however , in the present study , 3 patients showed deceptive early mibc recurrence with a cystitis glandularis crust covered on the surface after bladder sparing treatment , escaping random multiple biopsies . \n as a consequence , 2 patients missed the optimal opportunity for early diagnosis and delayed timely cystectomy . \n enhanced ct and ctu were also the preferred method for bladder surveillance , which showed high accuracy for detecting and staging urinary tract cancer . although biopsy revealed negative results in the present cases , ct or ctu showed enhanced and thickened bladder wall , which suggested highly suspicious of bladder cancer recurrence . \n therefore , patients showed suspicious lesions in cystoscopy with negative biopsy , enhanced ct or ctu should be recommended for further evaluation rather than watchful waiting . \n someinvasive variants , such as nested variant and microcystic carcinoma , might even mimic benign lesions , which may cause difficulties for pathologists in the differential diagnosis . \n however , in the present study , the pathological sections of the biopsy tissue obtained at cystoscopy of the 3 patients were blindly sent to 2 different pathologists for further evaluation after turbt confirmed mibc , the results were also suggestive of benign tissue , excluding the possibility of nested variant or microcysticurothelial carcinoma . \n the relationship between the formation of cystitis glandularis and mibc recurrence was unknown , but several factors might contribute to the deceptive appearance formation . first , such situation potentially reflected a response to bladder injury or chronic bladder inflammation caused by bladder surgery . \n in addition , ureteral reimplantation was reported to be associated with high recurrence and poor prognosis after pc . \n it was interesting that all patients with deceptive mibc recurrence had undergone ureteral reimplantation , which suggested that ureteral reimplantation might be a risk factor for such kind of recurrence . \n early mibc recurrence after bladder sparing therapy could simultaneously occurred with cystitis glandularis caused by bladder surgery ; this rare situation might lead to diagnosis of cystitis glandularis without realizing bladder cancer recurrence and missed the best treatment opportunity . \n the present cases served to remind and alert the urologists to be aware of the possibility of bladder cancer recurrence even when the biopsy of the bladder lesion was benign . as a result , timely pelvic enhanced ct and turbt were necessary when bladder lesion occurred after pc , avoiding the possibility of missing mibc recurrence and delaying timely cystectomy .",
      "summary": "abstractmost of recurrent bladder carcinoma after partial cystectomy did not cause diagnostic difficulties for urologists , because of the appearance of typical papillary in ultrasonography or cystoscopy , and could be easily confirmed by tumor biopsy . \n three patients , ages from 35 to 62 years , had undergone bladder sparing treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer , all of them had biopsy revealed benign bladder lesion at surveillance cystoscopy . however , transurethral resection of bladder tumor showed high - grade muscle invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma for these patients . \n two patients were thus delayed for timely cystectomy and consequently resulted in local or distal metastasis.as a result , we recommended that timely pelvic enhanced computed tomography and transurethral resection of bladder tumor were necessary when bladder lesion occurred after partial cystectomy , avoiding the possibility of missing muscle invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma recurrence and delaying timely cystectomy .",

specific antigen ( psa)-based screening and biopsy program , the majority of prostate cancer can be detected in the early stage and can be treated by radical prostatectomy . \n however , approximately 30% of prostate cancer patients will experience recurrence after the initial surgery and many of them will develop metastatic disease [ 47 ] . \n , the disease progresses relatively slow , but other cases grow aggressively and rapidly metastasize to other part of the body . currently , the major challenge in prostate cancer management is to predict the outcome of the disease accurately at the time of diagnosis , to identify who will need active treatment . \n clinical stage , psa , and gleason score are currently commonly used as prognostic indicators , but the accuracy is limited . \n it is well known that the initiation and progression of prostate cancer results from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes . \n epigenetic changes are characteristic of nearly all human tumors , including prostate cancer , and include changes in dna methylation , micrornas , and histone modifications . \n identification of epigenetic changes involved in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer will identify novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets . \n although the exact mechanism of how these epigenetic changes arise in prostate cancer is not well understood , the fact that they occur much more frequently than genetic changes may make them useful as potential biomarkers . \n dna methylation is the best studied epigenetic modification in prostate cancers , which occurs at cpg islands in the promoter region of a number of genes and cause transcriptional silencing of gene expression . \n promoter hypermethylation of critical genes could be useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets for prostate cancer . \n the protocadherin8 gene is located on human chromosome 13q14.3 ; the gen product contains 6 extracellular cadherin domains , a transmembrane domain , and a cytoplasmic domain . \n protocadherin8 plays crucial roles in cell adhesion , signal transduction , proliferation , migration , and invasion [ 1924 ] \n . a growing number of studies have demonstrated that protocadherin8 functions as a tumor suppressor in human cancers [ 1924 ] . \n moreover , it is frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in bladder cancer , renal cell carcinoma , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , gastric cancer and breast cancer , and is associated with poor prognosis [ 1924 ] . \n however , the methylation status and its clinical significance in prostate cancer remain unclear . in the current study \n , we analyzed the methylation status of protocadherin8 in localized prostate cancer tissues using methylation -

free survival of patients with prostate cancer according to protocadherin8 methylation status to elucidate its prognostic value . \n interestingly , patients with protocadherin8 methylated had worse prognosis than patients without ( p<0.0001 , figure 2 ) . to further determine the associations between biochemical recurrence - free survival and potential risk factors , univariate and multivariate cox regression model analysis was performed . \n univariate cox regression analysis first showed that gleason score , preoperative psa level , pathologic stage , and protocadherin8 promoter methylation were risk factors for poor biochemical recurrence - free survival . \n these risk factors were entered into multivariate cox regression analysis , revealing that protocadherin8 methylation and gleason score were independent prognostic risk factors for biochemical recurrence - free survival of patients with prostate cancer . \n it is of great important to identify novel prognostic and predictive markers to understand this multifaceted disease process and to identify which patients need more aggressive treatment after initial curative surgery [ 6,7,1416 ] . \n dna methylation of cpg islands within the promoter region of genes is an alternative mechanism of gene silence to genetic changes and is frequently involved in the development and progression of many types of human cancers , including prostate cancer . \n aberrant promoter methylation of some genes that are normally unmethylated may be used as potential molecular markers for the diagnosis , surveillance , and prognosis in prostate cancer . \n protocadherin8 is a tumor suppressor gene and is frequently silenced by aberrant promoter methylation in several human cancers . to date , \n the association between promoter methylation of protocadherin8 and the prognosis of prostate cancer has not been reported . \n this is the first study to investigate the prognostic value of protocadherin8 methylation in prostate cancer based on a relatively large number of clinical samples . in the current study \n , we analyzed the methylation status of protocadherin8 in 162 prostate cancer tissues and 47 normal prostate tissues using msp . \n we demonstrated that protocadherin8 methylation appeared more frequently in prostate cancer tissues than in normal prostate tissues . \n moreover , when we analyzed the association between protocadherin8 methylation and traditional clinicopathologic features in prostate cancer , we found that protocadherin8 methylation was significantly correlated with advanced pathologic stage , higher level of preoperative psa , higher gleason score , positive lymph node metastasis , and the occurrence of biochemical recurrence . \n these results suggest that protocadherin8 methylation plays an import role in the progression of prostate cancer and may be associated with the poor prognosis . to verify this hypothesis , \n kaplan - meier survival analysis was performed , showing that the biochemical recurrence - free survival time of patients with protocadherin8 methylated was significantly shorter than patients without . moreover , \n univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis demonstrated that protocadherin8 methylation is an independent predictor of the prognosis of prostate cancer . \n these results suggest that the detection of protocadherin8 methylation in tumor samples after surgery may help identify the patients prone to recurrence and could be a novel predictor for disease course in prostate cancer patients . \n our present data demonstrated that aberrant promoter methylation of protocadherin8 occurred frequently in prostate cancer , but not in normal prostate tissues . \n this result indicates that protocadherin8 methylation is tumor - specific and may be an early event in prostate cancer . \n in addition , the clinical significance of protocadherin8 methylation in prostate cancer is similar to findings of studies on other cancers [ 1921 ] . \n our findings further verified the possibility of using protocadherin8 methylation as a potential biomarker in prostate cancer . \n studies are needed to investigate the cause of protocadherin8 methylation and to discover how to reverse the methylation status of protocadherin8 in prostate cancer . \n promoter methylation of protocadherin8 is a frequent event in prostate cancer , and is associated with traditional risk factors of poor prognosis and shorter biochemical recurrence - free survival time . \n the present results indicate that protocadherin8 methylation is an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence - free survival in prostate cancer patients . \n our findings suggest that protocadherin8 methylation might be a useful prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer .",

table 3 ) . \n typical immunohistochemistry images of sdf-1 and nf-b in cervical cancer tissues and paired adjacent non - tumor tissues are shown in figures 1 and 2 . \n the positive percentage of sdf-1 expression in cervical cancer and adjacent non - tumor tissues were 68.6% ( 72/105 ) and 8.6% ( 9/105 ) , respectively . the positive percentage of nf-b expression in cervical cancer and adjacent non - tumor tissues were 60.0% ( 63/105 ) and 5.7% ( 6/105 ) , respectively . \n the chi - square test was used to confirmed that the difference in the expression level of sdf-1and nf-b between cervical cancer tissues and paired adjacent non - tumor tissues was statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) . \n the relationship between patients clinical parameters and the expression of sdf-1and nf-b is shown in tables 1 and 2 , respectively , showing that the expression of sdf-1 in the cervical cancer tissues is significantly correlated with tumor size ( =10.794 , p=0.001 ) and figo histology grade ( =7.000 , p=0.008 ) . \n however , there was no statistical correlation between sdf-1 expression and patient age , lymph node metastasis ( lnm ) status , stromal invasion , or tumor differentiation ( p>0.05 ) . \n similarly , the expression of nf-b in the cervical cancer tissues was significantly correlated with tumor size ( =7.421 , p=0.006 ) , figo histology grade ( =10.182 , p=0.001 ) , and lymph node metastasis ( lnm ) status ( =4.762 , p=0.029 ) . \n however , there was no statistical correlation was found between nf-b expression with patient age and stromal invasion and tumor differentiation ( p>0.05 ) . \n therefore , the results demonstrate that higher sdf-1 and nf-b expression in cervical cancer tissues is positively correlated with tumor metastasis and cancer progression , suggesting that sdf-1and nf-b play important roles in the progression . \n to further evaluate the relationship between sdf-1and nf-b expression and prognosis of cervical cancer , we performed log - rank survival analysis according to the sdf-1 and nf-b expression level and patient survival data . \n the survival analysis demonstrates that the cervical survival rate of the patients with negative sdf-1 and nf-b expression is significantly better than that of the patients with positive ones ( p<0.05 , figures 3 , 4 ) . \n furthermore , a multivariate cox regression analysis demonstrated that sdf-1 expression and lymph node metastasis are independent predictors of the os in cervical cancer patients . \n the expression of sdf-1 was positively correlated with the expression of nf-b ( r=0.201 , p=0.040 ; table 3 ) . \n it has 2 major isoforms :  and . both are derived from a single gene due to alternative splicing . \n it is well acknowledged that sdf-1 mediates a large number of crucial biological processes such as neuronal and cardiac development , angiogenesis , apoptosis , and stem cell motility . \n substantial evidence indicates that sdf-1 can mediate the activation of sdf-1/crcr4-pi3-mark - nf-b pathway , pi3k / akt , wnt , and erk pathways , and further promotes the invasion and progression of cancers [ 1719 ] . \n sdf-1 can also improve the expression of mmps and vegf , which are crucial for the aggressive behavior of cancers . \n many studies have revealed that the over - expression of sdf-1 is found in various malignancies , including lung cancer , prostate cancer , breast cancer , and pancreatic cancer . \n the nf - kb transcription factor family includes 5 genes : nf-b1 ( p50/p105 ) , nf-b2 ( p52/p100 ) , rela ( p65 ) , c - rel , and relb \n . normally , nf - kb dimmers are transcriptionally inactive due to their interaction with nf - kb inhibitors ( i kbs ) . \n activation of nf-b may result from the enhanced expression of epidermal growth factor receptor , insulin growth factor receptor , and tumor necrosis factor receptor families . \n activation of some other pathways , like pi3k / akt and ras / mapk , also participate in the activation of nf-b . \n some different kinds of molecular alterations in cancer cells may lead to impaired regulation of nf-b activation . \n in this situation , nf - kb becomes constantly activated , which leads to aberrant expression of downstream genes of nf-b , including those involved in regulation of cell cycle , proliferation , adhesion , and apoptosis . \n these pathophysiological changes may finally lead to the initiation , development , and metastasis of cancer . \n the results of this study indicate that the expression of sdf-1 is increased in cervical cancer tissues and is correrated with tumor size and figo histology grade . \n we found that the expression of nf-b is increased in cervical cancer tissues and is correrated with tumor size , figo histology grade , and lymph node metastasis . \n the potential mechanism may be that sdf-1 activates the nf-b pathway by the interaction with cxcr4 . \n the sdf-1/crcr4-nf-b pathway participates in the regulation of cell prliferation , apoptosis , and angiogenesis in cervical cancer . \n the increased expression of vegf and mmps caused by sdf-1-cxcr4 interaction and many nf-b - related biological macular - involved cell cycle , apoptosis , and chronic inflammation responses may mediate the initiation and progression of cervical cancer [ 3032 ] . \n it is well known that cancer pathogenesis is a multi - factor , multi - step , complicated process involved in gene - gene and gene - environment interactions . \n large and well - designed studies are still needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of cervical cancer . \n results of our study indicate that the expression of sdf-1 is significantly associated with tumor size and figo histology grade . \n the expression of nf-b is significantly associated with tumor size , figo histology grade , and lymph node metastasis . \n we also found that positive sdf-1 or nf-b expression is significantly correlated with poor prognosis .",

      "document": "epigastric hernia is a type of abdominal wall hernias due to a weakness , gap or opening in the muscles or tendons of the upper abdominal wall , on the alba line between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process . \n the hernial sac content is usually properitoneal fat , vascular structures and , uncommonly , abdominal viscera . \n epigastric hernias are usually occult in obese patients , and their symptoms may mimic peptic ulcer or gallbladder disease . \n there is a male predominance with a male to female ration of at least 3:1 , diagnosis usually occurs in the third to fifth decade . \n defects of the fascia may vary in diameter from several centimeters to only a few millimeters . \n the larger ones usually readily reducible , whereas the smaller often became in - carcerated . \n operative management aims at reposition of the hernia sac contents and direct closure of the hernial opening with a continuous suture . \n due to high recurrence rates , tension - free hernia repair with mesh is becoming more common . \n even if is a common and relatively simple procedure , there is no exact protocol today on how the repair should be done . \n the purpose of epigastric hernia surgery is to repair the weakening area between rectus abdominis and put the hernial sac back into the abdomen . the best way to restore the anatomy of the abdominal wall in a tension free manner , \n the mayo technique and its alterations could not stand the test of time and it shows a recurrence rate of 20% and higher . although there is no consensus opinion , the anatomic repair without tension and without an artificial enlargement of the defect is clearly the new trend in hernia repair techniques . in 1987 \n lichtenstein reported on 6321 cases of inguinal herniorraphy with a tension free repair , and in 1994 stuart reemphasized that special importance in his editorial in the lancet . \n a newer study from brancato and coworkers in italy also states the advantage of a tension - free prosthetic repair in 16 patients with epigastric hernia ; in their work no recurrence has been recorded . \n they found the technique simple , safe and absolutely effective , allowing immediate rehabilitation with a low rate of complications ( figs . \n small epigastric hernias is usually not a medical emergency and can be healed without surgery . \n when the symptoms are frequent and the problem affects the quality of life of the patient , surgery is the solution . \n the traditional approach to incisional hernia repair usually involves a surgical approach via the vertical scar . in young woman midline vertical scar \n they would rather prefer not to be operated instead of having such a visible scar . \n techniques developed for the surgical approach to mini - abdominoplasty include the use of the transverse lower abdominal incision and the resection of excess skin above the navel . \n the laparoscopic access was not the first choice because it did not allow the resection of the excess of skin . \n we report a case of epigastric hernia repair through a transverse lower abdominal incision with the resection of excess of skin . \n a 37 year - old female patient was diagnosed an epigastric hernia with a little diastasis recti . \n patient 's symptoms were sense of discomfort , bloat , sometimes associated with dull pain increasing with cough . \n she had a mild laxity of the skin in the lower part of the abdomen and the position of the navel was 16  cm from the pubic symphysis . \n she refused classic approach to surgical hernia repair due to the visible midline vertical scar . \n the general surgeon asked the cooperation of a plastic surgeon who found another technique reliable to solve the functional problem with an esthetic approach combining the hernia repair with a mini - abdominoplasty hiding the scar in the bikini zone . \n the miniabdominoplasty technique was chosen in accord to the abdominolipoplasty classification system proposed by mejia ja and castellanos c and categorized as a type ii . \n preoperatory marking was done following the type ii abdominoplasty described by pontes r. because the patient had such criteria in fact this technique is suitable for females with high position of the navel . \n the patient was placed in the supine position with the  break  in the table at the patient 's waist . \n the lower abdominal incision was first demarcated in the pubic area 6  cm above the anterior vulvar cleft . \n the incision was made , the flap was elevated , hemostasis was done to avoid any bleeding . \n the umbilicus was detached from its aponeurotic implantation to prepare the access to the epigastric hernia . \n care was taken to elevate the skin flaps only as far as necessary to define the hernial defect and to find surrounding fascia of good quality . \n this area lacks important perforator vessels , and the tunnel was wide enough to expose the medial borders of the rectus muscles . \n the pannus was raised to the costal margins taking care to avoid undermining laterally to preserve the intercostal perforators to the flap . \n the navel was released from its insertion on the aponeurosis and left attached to the flap , as described by psillakis in his paper . \n alba line was opened and the hernial defect was identified , isolated and was safely reduced . \n the edges were dissected to free the hernial sac and identify an intact facial edge . the hernia was reduced and the posterior fascia of rectus abdominis was dissected from its adjacent structures . \n a polypropylene mesh was placed over the posterior rectus fascia to prevent the recurrence of the hernia . \n the navel was reattached 2.5  cm below its original position maintaining 13.5  cm from the pubic symphysis , using a 3/0 absorbable suture . \n the excess of skin was sectioned after marking the cranial border of the flap with the pitanguy marker . \n epigastric hernia repair through a mini - abdominoplasty incision is a reliable method to approach an abdominal wall defect with an esthetic procedure . \n the use of the mini - abdominoplasty approach isolates the incision from the hernial defect and repair . \n we found a little difficult to access to the epigastric area through the subcutaneous tunnel , but , when the defect is not too big to repair and the flaps are elevated till the xiphoid process , then it is easy to prepare the posterior fascia and to inset the polypropylene mesh . in conclusion \n we find this approach suitable for those people who need a surgical repair of an epigastric hernia and have such conditions:laxity of the skin in the lower part of the abdomen.high position of the navel.patients refusing midline vertical scar . \n  \n  \n written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images . \n ",

psychiatry movement against biological imperialism ? \n a 23-year - old male , b.e student from upper middle socio - economic status , accompanied by his parents , presented with the complaints of anger outbursts , inability to mingle with people and inability to study . \n for the past 2 years , he attended neither the classes nor the home tuitions . \n most of the activities , which he tried to do ended in failure and angry frustrations . \n most of the time was spent in sleep , which was aided by sedative psychotropic medicines . \n he could not tolerate inactivity as it led to boredom and this was intolerable . remaining small time in the day he displayed a \n typical pattern  of behavior as noted by pedesky and beck  they may discontinue a task or fail to initiate a task they had planned to do . \n they may turn on the television , pick up some things to read , reach for food or a cigarette , get up and walk around and henceforth . \n mental status of the patient was that of an inhibited plump person with expressionless serious face , answering questions minimally , but relevantly without any psychotic symptoms . \n most of his anger outbursts erupted and lasted only for a few seconds and a few are followed by grumbling and shouting for about 10 min . \n anger resulted in yelling with angry gestures , banging , crumpling , throwing , tearing and breaking of objects ( one per attack ) such as shirt , pen , pencils , spectacles , remote control and rarely , mobile phones or computers . \n he avoided close relatives , strangers and crowds as it induced severe fear and inhibition . \n he was scared to talk to house maid , lift operator in the apartment , traffic police and ladies . \n he looked away from them and walked away at the prospect of an approaching lady . \n in fact his first visit to a psychiatrist was due to fear of lead contamination from wall paints . \n his other fears were , being cursed by god , old and sick people if they are disturbed by mistake , fear of going deaf or blind by strong sounds or bright light . \n he had magical beliefs that bad words if heard in the early morning , they will spoil the whole day and if any bad word is heard while praying , god will curse . \n he had rigid moral values in the matters of sexuality , religion and right or wrongs . \n he got infuriated with matters such as muslim religion , female gender , britons , beef eaters and rule breakers . \n he was pre - occupied with his sagging chest and wore tight banyans to hide it . \n he wanted to understand the subject perfectly and this inability led to a sense of failure and frustration and anger . \n patient was born to a highly educated and well - employed couple hailing from upper socio - economic status . \n his first degree paternal uncle has a chronic psychotic illness , but he is too highly educated and regularly employed . \n however , he was noted to be angry and used to kick walls if he got angry . in 10 and 11 \n standard he was bullied frequently by few students and ridiculed for his sagging chest by touching it . \n patient remained un - assertive and the abuse and emotional trauma inflicted was significant . during adolescence \n his past psychological assessments revealed above average intelligence and presence of several personalities disorder traits and low self - esteem . he was treated by more than a dozen of psychiatrist , exhausting all psychotropic medicines , including clozapine at 200 mg / day . \n when he visited the author he was on lithium 400 mg , fluoxetine 60 mg , amisulpride 100 mg , quetiapine 50 mg , clonazepam 3 mg , pregabalin 300 mg . \n cognitive therapy espoused by pedesky and beck was administered over 1 years , weekly 1 - 2 sessions of 1 - 2 h duration . \n schema modifications , behavioral experiments , cognitive restructuring , brief repeated exposures ( real and imaginary ) , exposure and/or response prevention for obsessional symptoms were used during therapy . \n psychiatrist trained to diagnose patients using atheoretical diagnostic systems and to treat by medicines is likely to over diagnose a psychotic illness in this case and treat accordingly . a flat affect , \n minimal talk , inhibited appearance , apparently unexplained anger outbursts and psychotic illness in a family member can lead to a misdiagnosis . \n a closer look reveals his warm affect , a keen interest to socialize and reasons for his anger . \n in fact historically this patient might have diagnosed as pseudo - neurotic schizophrenia , because of pervasive fears , phobias and strange sexual fantasies . in the past , severe avoidant cases were clubbed with schizoid personality . \n knowledge of cognitive theory and therapy helped the author to arrive at a right understanding ( diagnosis ) of the patient and consequently the proper treatment . \n patient warrants an additional diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder because aggression is not a part of avoidant personality . \n he also had anankastic personality disorder , obsessive - compulsive disorder , body dysmorphic disorder and paraphilia and even a dhat syndrome . \n one of the foundations of cognitive theory and therapy is that the appraisal ( personal meaning given ) of the events results in the emotions . \n similarly , his social fear can be explained by extreme sense of shame , sensitivity to insult and appraisal of people as dangerous and  paranoid  ( patient 's own word ) about him . \n the  typical pattern  of behavior noted earlier , can be explained by the cognitive and emotional avoidances . \n patient was intolerant of dysphoria and to reduce it , he repeatedly attempted to do one or the other activity . \n this case proves that psychotherapy can be a mainstay of treatment even in severe personality disorders .",
      "summary": "over dependence on pharmacotherapy in psychiatry , known as biological imperialism , is a world - wide phenomenon . \n some authors have opined that the inadequate and ineffective utilization of psychotherapeutic interventions and only dependence on pharmacotherapy amounts to institutional malpractice . here is an example of such a case . \n a young male mainly received multiple psychotropic medicines , including clozapine ( and also a failed psychotherapy ) over a period of 4 years , without any benefit . \n his global assessment of function score remained at 30 . \n however , with proper diagnosis and effectively conducted psychotherapy a significant improvement in global assessment of functioning score of 70 was achieved , over a period of 1 years .",

      "document": "Fortune magazine investigative reporter Peter Elkind, who co-authored The Smartest Guys in the Room, the definitive account of the Enron meltdown, spent the better part of a year investigating Steve Jobs. He talked to more than 50 people who knew and worked with Jobs, including former Apple AAPL CEOs and current members of the board \u2014 nearly everybody, it seems, except Jobs, who refused to be interviewed for the piece.\n\nThe resulting article is the cover story of the current issue. It\u2019s a great read, with more fresh details about Jobs\u2019 life and management style than any profile I\u2019ve ever read. Perhaps the most telling detail is the one laid out in the story\u2019s lead paragraphs:\n\nIn October 2003, as the computer world buzzed about what cool new gadget he would introduce next, Apple CEO Steve Jobs \u2013 then presiding over the most dramatic corporate turnaround in the history of Silicon Valley \u2013 found himself confronting a life-and-death decision.\n\nDuring a routine abdominal scan, doctors had discovered a tumor growing in his pancreas. While a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is often tantamount to a swiftly executed death sentence, a biopsy revealed that Jobs had a rare \u2013 and treatable \u2013 form of the disease. If the tumor were surgically removed, Jobs\u2019 prognosis would be promising: The vast majority of those who underwent the operation survived at least ten years.\n\nYet to the horror of the tiny circle of intimates in whom he\u2019d confided, Jobs was considering not having the surgery at all. A Buddhist and vegetarian, the Apple CEO was skeptical of mainstream medicine. Jobs decided to employ alternative methods to treat his pancreatic cancer, hoping to avoid the operation through a special diet \u2013 a course of action that hasn\u2019t been disclosed until now.\n\nFor nine months Jobs pursued this approach, as Apple\u2019s board of directors and executive team secretly agonized over the situation \u2013 and whether the company needed to disclose anything about its CEO\u2019s health to investors. Jobs, after all, was widely viewed as Apple\u2019s irreplaceable leader, personally responsible for everything from the creation of the iPod to the selection of the chef in the company cafeteria. News of his illness, especially with an uncertain outcome, would surely send the company\u2019s stock reeling. The board decided to say nothing, after seeking advice on its obligations from two outside lawyers, who agreed it could remain silent.\n\nIn the end, Jobs had the surgery, on Saturday, July 31, 2004, at Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, near his home. The revelation of his brush with death remained \u2013 like everything involving Jobs and Apple \u2013 a tightly controlled affair. In fact, nary a word got out until Jobs\u2019 tumor had been removed. The next day, in an upbeat e-mail to employees later released to the press, he announced that he had faced a life-threatening illness and was \u201ccured.\u201d Jobs assured everyone that he\u2019d be back on the job in September. When trading resumed a day after the announcement, Apple shares fell just 2.4%.\n\nYou can read the full story here, as well as an accompanying article about Apple, Inc. by Betsy Morris for which Jobs did agree to be interviewed. Both are highly recommended.\n\nDisclosure: I\u2019m an editor at Fortune and was interviewed by Elkind for his piece.",

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Protecting Internet Freedom Act''.\n\nSEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of Commerce and the National \n        Telecommunications and Information Administration (in this \n        section referred to as the ``NTIA'') should be responsible for \n        maintaining the continuity and stability of services related to \n        certain interdependent Internet technical management functions, \n        known collectively as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority \n        (in this section referred to as the ``IANA''), which includes--\n                    (A) the coordination of the assignment of technical \n                Internet protocol parameters;\n                    (B) the administration of certain responsibilities \n                associated with the Internet domain name system root \n                zone management;\n                    (C) the allocation of Internet numbering resources; \n                and\n                    (D) other services related to the management of the \n                Advanced Research Project Agency and INT top-level \n                domains.\n            (2) The interdependent technical functions described in \n        paragraph (1) were performed on behalf of the Federal \n        Government under a contract between the Defense Advanced \n        Research Projects Agency and the University of Southern \n        California as part of a research project known as the Tera-node \n        Network Technology project. As the Tera-node Network Technology \n        project neared completion and the contract neared expiration in \n        1999, the Federal Government recognized the need for the \n        continued performance of the IANA functions as vital to the \n        stability and correct functioning of the Internet.\n            (3) The NTIA may use its contract authority to maintain the \n        continuity and stability of services related to the IANA \n        functions.\n            (4) If the NTIA uses its contract authority, the \n        contractor, in the performance of its duties, must have or \n        develop a close constructive working relationship with all \n        interested and affected parties to ensure quality and \n        satisfactory performance of the IANA functions. The interested \n        and affected parties include--\n                    (A) the multistakeholder, private sector-led, \n                bottom-up policy development model for the domain name \n                system that the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names \n                and Numbers represents;\n                    (B) the Internet Engineering Task Force and the \n                Internet Architecture Board;\n                    (C) Regional Internet Registries;\n                    (D) top-level domain operators and managers, such \n                as country codes and generic;\n                    (E) governments; and\n                    (F) the Internet user community.\n            (5) The IANA functions contract of the Department of \n        Commerce explicitly declares that ``[a]ll deliverables provided \n        under this contract become the property of the U.S. \n        Government.''. One of the deliverables is the automated root \n        zone.\n            (6) Former President Bill Clinton's Internet czar Ira \n        Magaziner stated that ``[t]he United States paid for the \n        Internet, the Net was created under its auspices, and most \n        importantly everything [researchers] did was pursuant to \n        government contracts.''.\n            (7) Under section 3 of article IV of the Constitution of \n        the United States, Congress has the exclusive power to \n        ``dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \n        respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the \n        United States''.\n            (8) The .gov and .mil top-level domains are the property of \n        the United States Government, and as property, the United \n        States Government should have the exclusive control and use of \n        those domains in perpetuity.\n\nSEC. 403. MAINTAINING THE IANA FUNCTIONS CONTRACT.\n\n    The Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and \nInformation may not allow the responsibility of the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration with respect to the \nInternet domain name system functions, including responsibility with \nrespect to the authoritative root zone file and the performance of the \nInternet Assigned Numbers Authority functions, to terminate, lapse, \nexpire, be canceled, or otherwise cease to be in effect unless a \nFederal statute enacted after the date of enactment of this title \nexpressly grants the Assistant Secretary such authority.\n\nSEC. 404. EXCLUSIVE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF \n              .GOV AND .MIL DOMAINS.\n\n    Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this title, \nthe Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information \nshall provide to Congress a written certification that the United \nStates Government has--\n            (1) secured sole ownership of the .gov and .mil top-level \n        domains; and\n            (2) entered into a contract with the Internet Corporation \n        for Assigned Names and Numbers that provides that the United \n        States Government has exclusive control and use of those \n        domains in perpetuity.",
      "summary": "This bill provides continuing FY2017 appropriations to most federal agencies until the earlier of December 9, 2016, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation.  It prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2017 begins on October 1, 2016, because the FY2017 appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted. The bill specifies the rates of operations for security and nonsecurity programs for the duration of the continuing appropriations.  The bill enacts, by reference, the provisions of the conference report for H.R. 2577 (Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 and Zika Response and Preparedness Act).  American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015 or the American SAFE Act of 2015  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence must take specified actions to ensure that certain aliens from Iraq or Syria receive thorough background investigations and are certified not to be a security threat prior to being admitted to the United States as refugees.  Protecting Internet Freedom Act  The Department of Commerce may not allow the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions to cease unless a federal statute enacted after enactment of this bill expressly grants Commerce the authority.  Commerce must certify to Congress that the United States: (1) secured sole ownership of the .gov and .mil top-level domains, and (2) entered into a contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers that provides the U.S. government with exclusive control and use of those domains in perpetuity.

The intended author can be living or dead, and have written fiction or nonfiction or anything else; the key is to include \"how that author's work changed the student's way of thinking about the world or themselves.\" The students compete in three grade-based categories; this year, one of the two high school winners, Ayesha Usmani, read \"The Joy Luck Club\" and wrote to Amy Tan:\n\nMy mother asks, in her not-so-perfect English, if there is a sale. The clerk mumbles an answer, and my mother is confused. I quietly whisper to her in Urda that the sale was last week. My mother responds to me loudly in Urda, and I feel embarrassed. I distance myself from her as we head towards the car. People turn and look at us, muffling their giggles. I am imagining, but I am not imagining the shame....\n\nI strive to find the connection with mother. A connection that will balance independence and loyalty to my heritage. A balance of Pakistani values of love, obedience, and humility in harmony with American values of independence, free speech, and self-esteem. A journey that will always be difficult but worth the effort. I desired that connection with your guidance Amy Tan. A connection that I have now found.\n\nIt's lovely that the mother-daughter relationships of \"The Joy Luck Club,\" published 20 years ago, can speak to a second-generation immigrant today from an entirely different culture.\n\nBut not all of the entries are so serious. Over the last two years, more than 100,000 students have participated nationwide, and a few of the amusing lines are posted on another site for the project. \"Initially this book showed me nothing of interest, but then I reached page three,\" wrote Kyle to Caral Maras, author of \"Daniel's Story.\" And Lance told Lemony Snicket, author of \"Hostile Hospital,\" \"I think you should write more books. But that's just my opinion. Think about it.\" Maybe Snicket, a.k.a. Daniel Handler, got his letter -- he went on to write five more books in the Series of Unfortunate Events.\n\nPhoto by Caitlinator via Flickr",

buffered saline wash . \n nonspecific labeling was blocked with bovine serum albumin for 30  min . as primary antibody \n , we used the 14f7mab , a murine igg1 highly specific against n - glycolyl - gm3 ganglioside . \n sections were incubated with 14f7 mab ( 12  g / ml ) for 30 minutes at room temperature . \n then a kit universal dako lsab+system - hrp ( code k0679 , dako , denmark ) was applied to all sections according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . \n finally , the sections were counterstained with mayer 's hematoxylin , dehydrated through ascending ethanols to xylene , and mounted with eukitt ( kinder gmbh & co. , freiburg , germany ) . as a negative control , \n immunohistochemical results were evaluated according to proportion of stained cells and intensity of 14f7 mab reactivity . \n the proportion of stained cells was graded on a scale of 03 ( 0 , no staining ; 1 , 150% ; 2 , 5175% ; and 3 , 76100% ) . \n the staining intensity was graded on a scale of 03 ; 0 , no staining ; 1 , weak staining ; 2 , moderate staining ; and 3 , strong staining . \n subsequently , an immunoreactive scoring ( irs ) was obtained by multiplying the two previously mentioned parameters . \n the cutoff level of 14f7 immunostaining was defined as a dichotomous variable of low level ( irs < 6 ) or high level ( irs  6 ) . \n all slides were assessed by two trained observers who did not have knowledge of clinical characteristics or outcomes . \n the relationships between 14f7 mab immunoreactivity and clinicopathologic variables were analyzed using the chi - square test . \n survival rates were estimated by the kaplan - meier method and compared with the log - rank test . \n for multivariate analyses , the cox regression model was used to identify independent prognostic factors for overall survival ( os ) and disease - free survival ( dfs ) . \n the model included all variables to have significant prognostic value in univariate analysis ( log - rank test ) . \n os was measured from the date of surgery to death for any cause or last follow - up and was calculated for all patients . \n dfs was measured from the date of surgery to the date of second cancer , locoregional recurrence , distant metastases , and death for any cause or last follow - up and was calculated in patients with disease stages i  iii . all data on survival and disease - free survival were updated in july 2013 . \n the study population had a median age of 63 years ( range : 3685 years ) . according to histopathological type , all tumors were adenocarcinomas and the majority was of a moderate histological grade ( 62% ) . \n the immunostaining was observed in all cases , with variable intensity and proportion of stained cells . \n most specimens had strong intensity ( 68% ) and more than 75% of positive cells ( 62% ) as shown in table 2 . \n a moderate correlation was found between percentage of positive tumor cells and staining intensity ( spearman 's correlation coefficient 0,606 ; p = 0,000 ) . according to irs , \n the reactivity was observed on both membrane and cytoplasm of tumor cells with a staining pattern finely granular . in a few cases ( six specimens ) \n no significant differences were observed with age , sex , tumor location , grade of differentiation , mucinous type , mitotic index , pleomorphism grade , peritumoral inflammation , or lymphovascular invasion . \n however , the level of immunoreactivity showed statistical correlation with tnm stage ( p = 0,025 and spearman r = 0,317 ) . when cases were analyzed independently , according to intensity or extent of staining ( data not shown ) , no significant associations with clinicopathologic features were noted , except for the positive relation between proportion of stained cells and tnm stage ( p = 0,038 ) . in survival analysis \n , there was a significant difference in the 5-year os rates between high and low 14f7 mab immunostaining ( 40% versus 86,7% ; p = 0,002 ) . \n furthermore , patients with high level of 14f7 mab immunoreactivity had significantly impaired 5-year dfs ( p = 0,046 ) than those with low level ( 60,9% versus 92,3% ) . \n immunostaining was associated significantly with os ( p = 0,0078 ) while no significant relation was demonstrated with dfs , although a trend existed ( p = 0,0745 ) . \n univariate analysis showed that level of 14f7 mab immunostaining ( p = 0,0078 ) , tnm stage ( p = 0,0007 ) , and lymphovascular invasion ( 0,027 ) were significant prognostic factors for os . among these variables , level of 14f7 mab immunostaining ( hr = 0,268 ; 95% ci 0,0780,920 ; p = 0,036 ) and tnm stage ( hr = 0,249 ; 95% ci 0,0660,932 ; p = 0,039 ) were independent prognostic factors on multivariate analysis . for dfs , \n tumor location was significant prognostic factor ( p = 0,036 ) since patients with sigmoides tumor had poor survival . \n however , a trend existed for the level of 14f7 mab immunostaining ( p = 0,074 ) . \n as only one variable was significant in univariate analysis , multivariate analysis was not performed . \n given the limited impact of conventional factors in cc , it is necessary to identify new prognostic biomarkers that provide information concerning the natural history of this disease . \n the present study is the first to evaluate the prognostic significance of 14f7 mab immunostainingin patients with colon adenocarcinoma . \n the 14f7 mab immunoreactivity , against neugcgm3 , has been previously reported in some tumors including breast carcinoma , skin neoplasms , lung cancer , and neuroectodermal tumors . in our research \n , we used formalin - fixed and paraffin - embedded tissues , which is common in retrospective and long - term survival studies . \n however , as the routine tissues processing could damage the structure of gangliosides , further studies in frozen samples are recommended to confirm these results . \n although the presence of neugcgm3 in tumors has been demonstrated , the mechanisms that support its expression have been controversial . \n some studies suggest that its presence in human cancer is due to metabolic incorporation of dietary neugc , related with changes in the metabolism of tumor cells . \n it is well described that cells can process exogenous sialic acids from the extracellular environment and use them for their own glycoconjugates [ 18 , 19 ] . \n furthermore , our data showed a moderate 14f7 mab reaction in some normal glands surrounding the tumor . \n this is in line with previous studies that reported a limited recognition of 14f7 mab in normal tissues [ 1214 , 16 ] . \n a possible mechanism for this finding is that normal eukaryotic cells were able to take in a portion of ingested neugc and process it for their own glycoconjugates [ 18 , 20 ] , although other researches are needed in this regard . in this study , \n high 14f7 mab immunostaining was significantly associated with advanced tnm stage ( p = 0,025 ) , which is characterized by the presence of cancer cells in regional lymph nodes and evidence for metastases . \n although our findings suggest the role of neugcgm3 ganglioside in the oncogenic process , tumor growth and progression , further studies in larger sample with better distribution by each stage are required . \n our data is consistent with a previous report of scursoni et al . , who found a correlation between the expression of neugc - gm3 , using 14f7 mabs and more aggressive disease , in neuroectodermal tumors . \n previous studies have shown the relevance of this neugcgm3 in cancer progression and its capability of modulating cd4 expression on t cells [ 2123 ] . \n some properties of this ganglioside have been described including significant inhibition of human dendritic cells differentiation by inducing apoptosis in precursor cells , modification of cd4 expression , and promotion of th2 differentiation pattern in t lymphocytes . \n in fact , this molecule has been described as one of the most immunosuppressive gangliosides . \n showed that uptake of neu5gc into human tumor cells in vitro and delivery into the cytosolic compartment via a lysosomal transporter are enhanced by high cell growth rates . \n the tumor progression by stimulating inflammation via binding to neu5gc - positive tumor cells is another mechanism described . \n hedlund et al .   found that the combination of tumor - associated neu5gc and circulating anti - neu5gc antibodies promotes tumor growth , by inducing weak inflammation , causing infiltration of inflammatory cells and enhanced angiogenesis . in survival analysis , we reported that higher 14f7 mab immunostaining was significantly associated with impaired os ( in univariate and multivariate analysis ) and dfs ( in univariate analysis ) , suggesting its potential use in the prognostic estimate of colon adenocarcinoma . \n no similar studies have been previously described in this regard . only few reports in lung cancer \n found that neugc - gm3 expression was associated with better survival in non - small - cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) , while hayashi et al . \n one possibility is the differences in predominant histological type , as in the first two cases was it squamous subtype , while in the third it was adenocarcinoma , resembling our study . \n other factors like the number of patients evaluated and the distribution according to clinical stage as well as the specificity of the antibodies might lead to differences in results . in current research , \n univariate survival analysis confirmed the poor os associated with tnm stage and lymphovascular invasion , two putative pathologic markers of invasion and adverse outcome in cc . \n gangliosides have been considered attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy based on their higher abundance in tumors when compared with the corresponding normal tissue . in cuba , \n several clinical trials have been performed with the anti - neugc - containing gangliosides anti - idiotype monoclonal antibody racotumomab ( also known as 1e10 ) and the conjugated neugcgm3/vssp ( very small size proteoliposomes ) nanoparticle vaccine for immunotherapy of melanoma , breast , and lung cancer . \n both vaccines targeted to neugc - gm3 ganglioside have acceptable safety outcomes and are able to induce specific humoral and cellular immune responses . \n preliminary evidence suggested that these vaccines may have a positive influence on survival in patients with immune response to neugcgm3 antigen [ 7 , 3436 ] . \n this study is the first approach on the prognostic significance of 14f7 mab immunoreactivity , against n - glycolyl gm3 ganglioside , in patients with colon adenocarcinoma . \n the immunostaining correlated significantly with tnm stage and it was an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival in multivariate survival analysis . \n the current research suggests that assessment of 14f7 reactivity might be used in the prognostic estimate of colon adenocarcinoma , although our results need to be validated in a larger sample and prospective studies . \n furthermore , the role of neugcgm3 in tumor biology and its differential expression in tumor cells suggest its potential use as target for immunotherapy .",

      "document": "osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( onfh ) is a debilitating disease that can often lead to mechanical failure , with collapse of the articular surface and structural joint deformity.1,2 however , some cases of onfh remain asymptomatic if the necrotic lesion undergoes no collapse . \n the prognosis of onfh largely depends on the location and width of the necrotic lesion . \n when this lesion involves over two - thirds of the weight - bearing area of the femoral head , the rate of collapse has been reported to be around 94%.3 on the other hand , necrotic lesions occupying less than the medial two - thirds of the weight - bearing area have low risk of collapse around 19%.3 we herein describe a case of medially located onfh with an associated collapsed medial lesion . \n the patient was fully informed that her data would be submitted for publication , and she consented . \n a 60-year - old female ( height , 158 cm ; weight , 58 kg ; bmi , 22 ) presented with gradually worsening left hip pain . \n hip range of motion was not restricted . a t - score for bone mineral density based on the lumber spine was 1.5 sd , indicating the normal bone mass . \n a radiograph obtained 12 months after the onset of pain showed vertical sclerosis in the center of the femoral head , and the lesion inside the boundary demonstrated diffuse bony sclerosis ( fig . \n no collapse was observed at the weight - bearing surface of the femoral head , but joint space narrowing was recognized in the medial portion . \n t1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showed a vertical low - intensity band corresponding to the sclerotic rim on the radiograph ( fig . \n computed tomography ( ct ) showed a subchondral collapse at the medial lesion ( fig . \n 4 ) was obtained to confirm the diagnosis , using a 6-mm diameter biopsy needle that was advanced from the distal portion of the greater trochanter to the medial lesion of the femoral head . \n histologically , osteonecrotic bone trabeculae covered by appositional bone formation were seen within the lesion ( fig . \n 5 ) , and the bone marrow tissue contained vascular - rich fibrous tissues . based on these findings , the diagnosis of onfh was made . \n the patient was treated with celecoxib 200 mg / day for 4 months , and her hip pain gradually decreased . \n the latest radiograph 9 months after biopsy showed neither progression of collapse nor joint space narrowing . \n a high signal intensity on fat - saturated t2 images generally suggests a lesion with a rich vascularity or an edematous area including bone tumor . \n chondroblastoma is a rare bone tumor , arising from the secondary centers of ossification of long bones . \n the proximal femur is reported to be a common site of developing the tumor . since a lytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic border \n is considered to be diagnostic features , some cases may be confused with onfh.4 osteoid osteoma usually occurs near the metaphysis rather than the epiphysis , and appears as a radiolucent nidus showing high signal intensity on t2 images , accompanied by bone marrow edema.5 although the imaging findings of our cases seemed to be less similar to those of the tumors , we were unable to make a diagnosis of onfh due to the atypical imaging findings . \n then , we decided to perform the bone biopsy to clarify a diagnosis of our case . \n microscopically , the high - intensity area consisted of abundant vascularized fibrous tissue in combination with thickened trabeculae , indicating the reparative condition of the necrotic lesion . \n osteonecrotic lesions involving the medially located non - weight - bearing area generally remain asymptomatic . it has been reported that necrotic lesions occupying less than the medial two - thirds of the weight - bearing area have low risk of collapse to be around 19%.3 in addition , such osteonecrotic lesions generally tend to be repaired over time if they do not undergo collapse,6 and repaired necrotic lesions show osteosclerotic changes.7 in our case , most of the necrotic lesion was repaired by prominent appositional bone formation . \n motomura et al.8 reported that collapse consistently involved fracture at the lateral boundary of the necrotic lesion , at the junction between the thickened trabeculae of the reparative zone and the necrotic bone trabeculae . in the current case , \n on the other hand , an axial ct slice showed a fracture at the anteromedial junction between the thickened trabeculae and the necrotic bone trabeculae , against the anterior edge of the acetabulum . \n we speculated that collapse might have been caused by the repetitive mechanical stress between the anterior edge of acetabulum and the anteromedial necrotic lesion adjacent to the thickened trabeculae of the reparative zone . regarding the mechanisms of collapse in onfh , kenzora and \n glimcher9 reported that a fracture may begin in the region of the resorbed necrotic subchondral plate at the lateral junction between necrotic and viable bone . in our case , \n ct showed some degree of bone resorption around the collapsed lesion , whereas diffuse bony sclerosis was seen in the necrotic area , indicating that osteonecrotic area has been repaired . \n further studies are necessary to conclude whether subchondral bone resorption antedates the collapse in onfh.10,11 regarding the distribution of the necrotic area in onfh , several studies have suggested the importance of vessels feeding the femoral head.1215 the superior retinacular artery is known to be the principal source of blood to a large area of the femoral head , including the weight - bearing area of the superior portion.12,13 on the other hand , the inferior retinacular artery ( ira ) has also been reported to contribute to the vascularity of the femoral head.14,15 boraiah et al . \n reported that the ira feeds 62% of the medial half of the femoral head.14 furthermore , liu et al.15 reported that necrotic lesions tended to occupy the medial two - thirds or less of the weight - bearing area when the ira was damaged . \n the medial location of the necrotic area in our case might have resulted from a disturbance of the ira .",

      "document": "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n     This application and the following copending applications by Richard J. Hagan are directed to related inventions: Ser. No. 06/685,912, filed Dec. 27, 1984 and entitled &#34;Method and Apparatus for Storing and Dispensing Fluids Containered Under Gas Pressure&#34;; Ser. No. 06/635,450, filed July 31, 1984 and entitled &#34;Syphon Assembly and Package Incorporating the Assembly&#34; and Ser. No. 06/687,296, filed Dec. 28, 1984 and entitled &#34;Integral Syphon Package Head&#34;. \n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n     1. Field of the Invention \n     This invention relates to a modified form of a seltzer bottle filling apparatus and to a process for filling a seltzer bottle having a detachable head with the head detached. More particularly, it relates to such an apparatus and process in which such a seltzer bottle is filled through a valve mechanism that remains on the bottle. \n     2. Description of the Prior Art \n     The substantial prior art on syphon seltzer bottle technology is summarized in the related applications. Briefly, conventional seltzer bottles are provided with syphon heads that remain permanently with the bottle. The head and bottle assembly is refilled with seltzer water under pressure for each use. The seltzer bottles and syphon head assemblies are of heavy duty, rugged construction in order to provide strength against the substantial gas pressures of up to 10 atmospheres employed in such seltzer bottles, and also to allow reuse of the syphon head-bottle combination for many years. \n     The related applications provide, for the first time, an apparatus and method in which the seltzer or other liquid may be packaged under such substantial gas pressure in a recyclable or disposable container. \n     In the conventional technique for filling seltzer bottles, the head-bottle combination is inverted in a cradle, a nozzle is connected to the spout of the head, the lever of the head is depressed to open the valve disposed in the head, and the seltzer water enters the bottle through the head and the syphon tube. A sequence of fill and sniff operations is carried out by the filling apparatus in order to remove air displaced by the seltzer water as the bottle fills. In order to fill the recyclable or disposable packages disclosed in the related applications, modification of this prior art apparatus and process is required. \n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n     Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide apparatus and a process especially adapted to fill syphon packages of the type having a removable head with the head removed. \n     It is another object of the invention to provide such an apparatus and process which is easily implemented as a modification of commercial filling equipment now in use \n     It is a further object of the invention to provide seltzer filling apparatus and a process using a permanent head that interacts with a valve on a seltzer syphon package without a head to fill the package. \n     The attainment of these and related objects may be achieved through use of the novel syphon package filling apparatus and process of this invention. A filling apparatus in accordance with this invention includes a cradle movably attached to the apparatus and configured to receive a syphon package in a first orientation. A permanent syphon filling head is attached to the apparatus proximate to a necked opening of the syphon package when the package is loaded in the cradle. A pivoting means mechanically coupled to the cradle moves the cradle from the first orientation to a second orientation in which the necked opening of the syphon package is directed downward. A biasing means activated during the cradle pivoting urges the syphon package into engagement with the permanent syphon filling head. A head activating means activates the head to open a valve in the neck of the syphon package. A source of seltzer water or other liquid under pressure connected to the permanent syphon filling head then fills the syphon package through the syphon head and valve and syphon tube of the package. The valve is then closed and the cradle returned to the first orientation to move the filled syphon package out of engagement with the permanent filling head. In a preferred form of the apparatus, the permanent filling head and the biasing means are on the cradle, so that a modified cradle incorporating these elements may simply replace the conventional cradle on present syphon seltzer bottle filling machines. \n     This invention provides a simple modification to the apparatus and process conventionally employed for filling syphon seltzer packages with attached heads so that this apparatus and process can be used in modified form to accomodate syphon packages without attached heads. Existing equipment therefore can be used with a new type of package without extensive modification. \n     The attainment of the foregoing and related objects, advantages and features of the invention should be more readily apparent to those skilled in the art, after review of the following more detailed description of the invention, taken together with the drawings, in which: \n    \n    \n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n     FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a syphon package of a type that is utilized with this invention. \n     FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a syphon seltzer bottle filling apparatus in accordance with the invention. \n     FIG. 3 is a side view of a portion of the apparatus of FIG. 2. \n     FIG. 4 is a similar side view of the apparatus portion shown in FIG. 3, but in a different operating position. \n     FIG. 5 is an enlarged cross-section view of part of the apparatus portion shown in FIG. 4. \n     FIG. 6 is a top view of another part of the apparatus portion shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. \n    \n    \n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n     Turning now to the drawings, more particularly to FIG. 1, there is shown a syphon package of the type that is filled with the apparatus and process of this invention. The package stores and dispenses fluids containered under gas pressure and includes a plastic, metal, composite or other substantially non-frangible container 1 capable of safely withstanding in excess of three atmospheres of pressure, preferably a 2.0 liter bottle capable of safely carrying liquids at 150 psi (10 atmospheres). The container is formed with a neck portion 2 having an external attachment member 3. Preferably, the bottle is an 18 to 20 mil polyester terephthalate (PET) bottle. The external attachment member on the outside wall of the neck may be the formation of screw threads 3 in the plastic. \n     A valve means 4 is mounted substantially within the container neck portion for maintaining gas pressure of at least three atmospheres and preferably up to about 150 psi or about 10 atmospheres. A tube 5, commonly known as a syphon tube, is connected to the valve and has a distal end which extends to a point adjacent to the bottom of the bottle. The container is filled with liquid 8, such as carbonated water pressurized to about 10 atmospheres. The liquid 8 flows up through the hollow syphon tube and through the valve 4 when opened. \n     A cap 9 removably covering the opening in the neck portion of the bottle is used during storage and shipment of the package. The cap is removed prior to placing head 10 on the bottle and dispensing the liquid 8. The cap 9 preferably is of light weight aluminum formed with internal threads, tamper resistant and recyclable or disposable. The cap is not under pressure, due to the presence of valve 4, unlike all caps for lightly carbonated beverages. \n     Head 10 is removably affixed by means of internal threads on the wall 12 of head 10 to the threads 3 on the neck portion 2 of the container after removing cap 9. The head member has a manually engageable valve actuating lever 13. A remote valve actuating pin is selectively operable by the valve actuating lever and is positioned inside head 10 for engagement with the valve 4. When valve 4 is opened, the liquid 8 is discharged from spout 18. Further details on various forms of such detachable head syphon packages are available in the above referenced related applications, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. Since the head 10 is not in place at the time the package is filled with the liquid 8, conventional equipment used to fill syphon packages with permanently attached heads is not suitable for filling this package. \n     FIG. 2 shows a filling apparatus 20 in accordance with the invention for filling the bottles 1. The apparatus 20 has a rotatable frame 22, to which are mounted a plurality of filler stations, such as the stations 24A, 24B and 24C shown in FIG. 2. A typical filling apparatus 20 contains from 8 to 40 of the filler stations 24A-24C. Each of the stations 24A-24C has a cradle 26A, 26B and 26C, configured to receive one of the bottles 1. The cradles 26A-26C are pivotally coupled to arms 28A, 30A, 28B, 30B, 28C and 30C at pivots 32A, 32B and 32C. The cradles 26A-26C are also pivotally coupled to brackets 34A, 34B and 34C at pivot points 36A, 36B and 36C. The cradles 26A-26C each have a head, such as the heads 38A and 38B visible in FIG. 2, above the bottle receiving area of the cradles 26A-26C. The cradles 26A-26C have movable platforms 40A, 40B and 40C engaging the bottom of the bottles 1. The movable platforms 40A-40C are connected to the pivot points 32A-32C by linkages 42A, 44A, 42B, 44B, 42C and 44C. The linkages 42A-44C serve to urge the bottles 1 against the heads 38A-38C when the cradles 26A-26C are raised to the position shown at 26C. Filling apparatus of the general type shown, but only capable of filling conventional syphon bottles with attached heads, is commercially available from Marcel S.A., Buenos Aires, Argentina. \n     In operation, the bottles 1 are loaded in the cradles 26A-26C when they are in the vertical position shown for cradle 26A. The arms 28A-28CC are raised as sequentially shown for cradles 26B and 26C to pivot the cradle through a horizontal position shown at 26B to the raised position shown at 26C. Lines 43A, 43B and 43C are connected to a source of liquid 8 under pressure and to valves 41A, 41B and 41C. Lines 45A, 45B and 45C are connected to vent entrapped air and other gas 39 from the bottles 1 as they are filled. Lines 45A, 45B and 45C are also connected to valves 41A, 41B and 41C. The valves 41A, 41B and 41C are controlled to switch between the lines 43A, 43B, 43C and the lines 45A, 45B, 45C to carry out the alternate fill and sniff cycles. \n     FIGS. 3-5 show further details of the cradle 26. Since corresponding elements are present on each of the cradles 26A-26C shown in FIG. 2, the letter designations following each reference number will not be employed in the following discussion of FIGS. 3-6. FIG. 3 shows the cradle 26 in its orientation for loading the bottle 1 for filling, and also for unloading the bottle 1 after it has been filled. FIG. 4 shows the cradle 26 after it has been raised to the position for filling the bottle 1. Head 38 is permanently attached to the cradle 26 so that it rests above the bottle 1 when the cradle 26 is in the position shown in FIG. 3. The head 38 contains the same functional elements as the head 10 of FIG. 1 that the user attaches to the neck 2 of the bottle prior to discharging the liquid 8. Lever 50 is pivotally attached to the head 10 at 52, so that force to move the lever to the position shown in solid line in FIG. 5 moves actuating rod 54 in the direction shown by arrow 56 to open the valve 4 in neck 2 of the bottle 1. Spring 58 biases the actuating rod 54 to the position shown in dotted line in FIG. 5, where it will not engage the valve 4. Unlike the head 10 in FIG. 1, the head 38 has a resilient seat 60 formed from polytetrafluoroethylene or other durable, resilient material lining cavity 62 to form an effective seal with the neck 2 of the bottle when the bottle is urged against the head 38 by the plate 40. The seat 60 and cavity 62 have a centrally disposed aperture 64 communicating with spout 66 so that liquid may enter the bottle 1 through the head 38. \n     Linkage 42 for activating plate 40 to urge bottle 1 against the head 38 has a first lever 68 pivotally attached to the cradle 26 at 32. Slot 72 of the lever 68 is pivotally attached to pivot point 36 of bracket 34 (FIG. 2). Lever 68 is angled, with a second portion 74 extending from the pivot 32. Portion 74 of the lever 68 is pivotally attached to rod 76 at 78. Rod 76 is also pivotally attached at 80 to a second angled lever 82. Lever 82 is in turn pivotally attached to the cradle 26 at 84. Portion 86 of the angled lever 82 is pivotally attached to rod 88 at 90. Rod 88 is fixedly attached to the plate 40. Linkage 44 (FIGS. 2 and 6) contains corresponding elements and therefore will not be described further. If desired, one or more of the members comprising the linkages 42 and 44 can be made adjustable in length to provide increased tolerance in the mechanism. \n     In operation, when the cradle 26 is raised to the position shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, lever 68, rod 76, and lever 82 pivot from force applied to the lever 68 by bracket 34, as indicated by arrows 92, 94 and 96 so that rod 88 forces plate 40 against the bottle 1. Neck 2 of the bottle 1 moves into sealing engagement with the head 38, as indicated by arrow 98. In practice, the plate 40 should apply a pressure of from about 150 to 200 psi against the bottle 1 for this purpose. A tension spring 100 can be provided connecting the pivot 84 and the lever 82 to limit the pressure to this amount. \n     FIG. 5 shows the bottle 1 with its neck 2 in sealing engagement with the seat 60 of head 38, and the head 38 activated to open valve 4, so that the liquid 8 may enter the bottle through the head 38, valve 4 and syphon tube 5. After the bottle 1 has been inverted by moving cradle 26 to the position shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, fitting 102 is moved down as indicated by arrow 104 to engage the spigot 66. Fitting 102 is connected to valve 41 (FIG. 2) Rod 106 is then moved upward, as indicated by arrow 108, to move the lever 50 from the position indicated in dotted line in FIG. 5 to the position there shown in solid line. Rod 54 is therefore activated to open valve 4, thus allowing the pressurized liquid 8 to enter the bottle 1. As is conventional in syphon package filling, the fitting 102 is alternately connected by the valve 41 to receive the liquid 8 from line 43 for filling the bottle and to the exhaust line 45 for removing gas trapped in the bottle 1 above the liquid 8 through the syphon tube 5. This mode of filling is referred to in the seltzer industry as alternate fill and sniff cycles. When the bottle 1 has been filled, rod 106 is lowered so that rod 54 may move out of engagement with valve 4, allowing the valve to close. Fitting 102 is then disconnected from the spigot 66, and the cradle 26 returned to the position shown in FIG. 3 for removal of the filled bottle. \n     FIG. 6 shows the tandem linkages 42 and 44 on either side of the cradle 26. Providing the linkages 42 and 44 in tandem assures even application of force across the surface of plate 40 against the bottle 1, giving reliable operation and preventing uneven wear of the cradle assembly. \n     It should now be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that a novel filling apparatus, attachment for a filling apparatus and process capable of achieving the stated objects of the invention has been provided. The filling apparatus of this invention fills syphon packages having a removable head with the head removed. The cradle assembly of this invention allows ready modification of commercially available syphon package filling equipment designed for filling syphon packages with permanently attached heads to fill the removable head syphon packages with the head removed. The process of this invention fills such packages in an efficient manner. \n     It should further be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details of the invention as shown and described may be made. It is intended that such changes be included within the spirit and scope of the claims appended hereto.",
      "summary": "A filling apparatus (20) for a syphon package has a pivotally movable cradle (26A, 26B, 26C) configured to receive a syphon bottle 1 in a first orientation. A permanent syphon filling head (38A, 38B, 38C) is near necked opening (2) of the bottle when the bottle is loaded in the cradle (26A). Arms (28A, 28B, 28C, 30A, 30B, 30C) move the cradle (26A, 26B, 26C) from the first orientation to the second orientation in which the necked opening (2) of the bottle (1) is directed downward. Linkages (42A, 42B, 42C, 44A, 44B, 44C) and plate (40A, 40B, 40C) urge the bottle (1) into engagement with the filling head (38). Rod (106) depresses lever (50) to activate filling head (38) for opening valve (4) in the neck ( 2) of the bottle (1). Lines (43A, 43B, 43C) supply liquid under pressure to the filling head (38). Lines (45A, 45B, 45C) remove gas from the bottle (1) during filling of the bottle (1) with the liquid (8). Linkages (42A, 42B, 42C, 44A, 44B, 44C) and plate (40A, 40B, 40C) allow bottle (1) to move out of engagement with filling head (38) after valve (4) is closed when cradle (26A, 26B, 26C) is pivoted from the second orientation to the first orientation.",

      "document": "to date , 100  years after the introduction of the low tie and high tie techniques for colorectal surgery by miles and moynihan , respectively [ 1 , 2 ] , the discussion on which is the best technique continues , as illustrated by two recently published reviews [ 3 , 4 ] . \n nevertheless , they propagate the high tie technique since it allows better lymph node retrieval and therefore a more accurate tumour staging . in another review comparing the low tie with the high tie technique , lange et al . \n nevertheless , they favour the low tie technique since it is less invasive , also with regard to colonic innervation and motility , and it would be beneficial for anastomotic perfusion compared to the high tie technique . \n performing a high tie ( ht ) technique allows anastomotic perfusion only through the marginal artery , which may lead to a decrease in anastomotic perfusion [ 5 , 6 ] . \n when a low tie ( lt ) technique is performed , anastomotic perfusion is allowed not only through the marginal artery , but through the left colic artery and its ascending branch as well . \n this anatomical reality suggests that anastomotic perfusion is higher after low tie ; however , no evidence exists supporting this hypothesis . \n the aim of this study is to compare the high tie technique to the low tie technique with regard to anastomotic perfusion . \n patients planned for elective rectal resection for malignancy in four participating hospitals , with nine participating surgeons , were eligible for this non - randomized , prospective study . \n the o2c system (  oxygen to see  , lea medizin technik , giessen , germany ) is a laser doppler flowmetry system that has often been used to measure intestinal blood flow for research purposes [ 7 , 8 ] . \n blood flow , expressed in arbitrary units , is determined by analysing the doppler frequency shifts in laser light ( 820  nm ) reflected from moving red blood cells . \n the laser light is emitted into the tissue , and the backscattered light is detected with a flat probe with a measurement depth of 46  mm ( lea medizin technik , giessen , germany ) . \n the o2c measurement frequency is 30  hz . measurements were performed at two moments during the operation , being ( a ) right after median laparotomy and ( b ) just before construction of the anastomosis or colostomy , in case of abdominoperineal resection . \n the measurements were performed on the antimesenterial , serosal side of the colon segment that was to become , or was after resection ( at moment b ) , the proximal loop . \n for all measurements , after placement of the flat probe , the flow measurement was allowed to stabilize until a constant flow was measured . \n the mean of these 15 measurements was used to calculate the blood flow ratio ( bfr ) , b / a . during the measurements , \n the blood pressure was measured as well , and the mean arterial pressure ( map ) was calculated . \n the high tie technique was defined as ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery ( i m a ) at its origin . \n the low tie technique was defined as ligation of the superior rectal artery ( sra ) , just below the branching of the left colic artery ( fig .  1 ) . \n b the dashed line indicates the level of ligature in ht , leaving no flow in the inferior mesenteric artery and its branches . \n c the dashed line indicates the level of ligature in lt ; grey indicates the flow area of i m a after lt the vasculature of the colon . \n b the dashed line indicates the level of ligature in ht , leaving no flow in the inferior mesenteric artery and its branches . \n c the dashed line indicates the level of ligature in lt ; grey indicates the flow area of i m a after lt the bfr distribution was normalised by a logarithmic transformation and compared between the ht and lt groups by means of an unpaired t test . \n a ht was performed in 16 patients ( 48% ) of whom 12 ( 75% ) received a primary anastomosis . a lt was performed in 17 patients ( 52% ) of whom also 12 ( 71% ) received a primary anastomosis . in all patients receiving a primary anastomosis , \n nine patients ( 75% ) in the high tie group and ten patients ( 83% ) in the low tie group received a defunctioning stoma . \n the mean number of lymph nodes harvested in the high tie group was 11 ( range , 623 ) ; in the low tie group , 12 ( range , 633 ) ( p  =  0.35 ) . the mean number of positive lymph nodes harvested in the high tie group was 3 ( 15 ) ; in the low tie group , 4 ( 19 ) ( p  =  0.32 ) . \n two patients developed anastomotic leakage , one in the ht group and one in the lt group . in the ht group , \n no significant differences were found in the remaining baseline characteristics ( table  1 ) . \n table  1patient characteristics of included patientsbaseline characteristicshigh tielow tiep valuegender ( m / f)11/512/51.000age ( years)55    1761    130.363bmi ( kg / m)25    327    70.473operation1.000apr45lar1212neoadjuvant therapy0.024rt148no rt29asa score0.170i75ii86iii16cardiovascular comorbidity2 ( 13%)4 ( 24%)0.656operating time ( minutes)160 ( 100340)145 ( 45225)0.450tumour stage0.250010i44iia24iib10iiia23iiib13iiic01iv40m / f male / female , bmi body mass index ( kilograms per square meter ) , apr abdominoperineal resection , lar low anterior resection , rt radiotherapy , asa score american society of anaesthesiologists score patient characteristics of included patients m / f male / female , bmi body mass index ( kilograms per square meter ) , apr abdominoperineal resection , lar low anterior resection , rt radiotherapy , asa score american society of anaesthesiologists score the mean bfr was significantly higher in the lt group as depicted in table  2 , whereas the blood pressure during measurements was not significantly different as depicted in table  3 . \n table  2comparison of blood flow ratios between the ht and lt techniquesratioht / ltmean ratiostd . \n error of the meanp valueb / aht0.910.240.04lt1.480.32table  3map measured during the blood flow measurements at time points a and b , respectivelygroupmap a / bmeanstd . \n error of the meanp valuehta67.12.20.473b64.23.2lta69.84.40.075b75.72.0 comparison of blood flow ratios between the ht and lt techniques map measured during the blood flow measurements at time points a and b , respectively \n to date , the discussion on the matter of high tie versus low tie continues . \n this study focuses on the colorectal vasculature and the flow change after ht or lt . \n found the colonic blood flow to vastly decrease after ligation of i m a or sra , with the subsequent conclusion that this could be an unavoidable factor in the pathophysiology of colorectal anastomotic leakage . \n only a slightly decreased blood flow was observed at the end of the operation ( bfr 0 , 91 ) , whereas an increased blood flow was measured after lt ( bfr 1 , 48 ) . \n the blood flow changes occurred independently from the systemic blood pressure ( table  3 ) . \n these different findings may be explained by the time interval between arterial ligation and measurement . \n study the first measurement was performed immediately after laparotomy , and the second measurement , just before construction of the anastomosis or colostomy , i.e. at the end of the operation . \n therefore , the interval between ligation and measurement is much longer in this study compared to the aforementioned study . \n this suggests that over time , a recruitment of colonic arteries occurs , allowing recovery of blood flow . in order to study \n whether these blood flow changes are permanent or not , blood flow measurements in the postoperative period would be interesting . \n in addition , since anastomotic leakage is generally detected around the eighth postoperative day , it could provide important information on the pathophysiological processes concerning blood flow leading to al . \n the bfr was significantly higher after lt which means lt allows better perfusion of the proximal anastomotic loop at the end of the operation . \n most likely , this is due to the preservation of the left colic artery and its ascending branch . \n in addition to the marginal artery , these arteries allow a second pathway for blood supply and faster and/or a more extensive recruitment of colonic arteries . therefore , since good perfusion is essential for proper anastomotic healing , lt would be the preferred technique for this aspect of the high tie  low tie comparison . \n the average bfr after lt shows an increase in blood flow compared to the initial value at the end of the operation . \n this has been described before by karlicek et al .   and could be due to reactive hyperaemia as a result of colon manipulation . \n however , it could also be due to a variety of ischaemia reperfusion injuries ( iri ) . \n these injuries have been well described in animal models in which an iri leads to visible hyperaemia and decreased anastomotic strength . \n this response is probably also present after ht ; however , it is more outspoken after lt most likely due to preservation of the left colic artery . \n whether these findings have an impact on the incidence of anastomotic leakage should be evaluated by analysing the blood flow during the postoperative period or in a similar but larger study . \n the o2c allows non - invasive measurement of blood flow ; however , the measurements are sensitive to several variables . \n since it is virtually impossible to mark a spot on the colon without influencing the local blood flow or without hindering the progress of the operation , placement of the probe will be slightly variable . \n second , the measurements are sensitive to different pressures applied on the probe when holding it in the right position . \n higher pressures are likely to lead to more compressed arteries and a lower blood flow . in order to limit the influence of these variables on the outcome \n in addition , the blood flow ratio was calculated for which the first measurement served as a control . \n the use of a ratio also allowed standardizing intrinsic , patient - related differences like microangiopathy due to atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus . \n table  1 shows baseline characteristics to be comparable between ht and lt except for radiotherapy . \n this is , however , unlikely to have an effect on the blood flow in the proximal anastomotic loop since this loop is located outside the radiation field . \n in addition , the high tie group contained a higher number of patients with metastasized disease ( stage 4 present in 25% in the ht group vs. 0% in the low tie group ) . \n this difference most likely illustrates the participating surgeons having preferred to perform a high tie technique in patients with metastasized disease . \n when comparing high tie ligation to low tie ligation , this study shows the perfusion of the proximal loop of the anastomosis to be better after low tie ligation . considering neither of both techniques \n is favourable on the oncological or technical aspect , low tie ligation may be the technique of choice in patients undergoing rectum resection .",

      "document": "breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women and affects about 1 in 8 women around the world ( 1 ) . \n therefore , investigation of early biomarkers and molecular aspects is valuable for improvement of breast cancer therapy and outcome . \n cancer - testis antigens ( cta ) are proteins with physiological expression restricted to adult testicular germ cells . \n they are down - regulated in somatic adult tissues but may be aberrantly re - expressed in various malignancies . \n the first cta was discovered by taking advantage of a newly developed dna - cloning method to identify targets of t - cell recognition . \n cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctl ) recognizing autologous tumor cells were obtained from a patient bearing melanoma with an unusually favorable clinical course . using the melanoma cell line mz2- mel and autologous ctl clones cytolytic to this line , mage-1 , \n subsequently was renamed as mage - a1 , and was identified as the target antigen . \n this was the first molecularly characterized tumor antigen eliciting autologous ctl responses in a cancer patient . \n further analysis of the mage - a family revealed 12 closely related genes clustered at xq28 . \n a growing number of tumor - associated antigens ( taa ) , with similar characteristics , identified by cellular or serological screening techniques , have been reported since . \n although some of them may be expressed in placenta as well , they are collectively referred to as cta . \n cta presently include 44 distinct gene families , some comprising multiple members , such as mage - a and gage1 , as well as splice variants , such as xage1a and xage1b , for a total of 89 transcripts . \n cta can be classified into those that are encoded on the x chromosome ( x - cta ) and those that are not ( non - x ctas ) ( 2 ) . to date , almost 100 genes and gene families encoding ctas have been identified . \n ctas mapping to chromosome x are referred to as x -ctas and are distinguished from non - x ctas located on other chromosomes ( 2 - 4 ) . \n x - ctas expression in breast cancer tissues is associated with a poor outcome and is more prevalent in higher grade and advanced stage tumors ( 5 - 9 ) . due to \n testis blood barrier and the immune privileged status of germinal cells ( 10 ) , expression of ctas in tissues other than testis can trigger an immune response . \n these antigens are also expected to become new candidates for cancer - specific immunotherapy , but little information is available on the comprehensive expression of ctas in a large number of samples of gastrointestinal and breast carcinomas ( 11 ) . \n expression of ctas of the mage family has been also reported in human breast carcinomas although only to a limited degree ( 12 ) . \n breast cancers , especially triple - negative cancers , show higher expression of ct genes , which is the prerequisite for any immunotherapeutic approach . \n ct genes have also gained attention for immunoprevention in high - risk patients ( 13 ) . \n the purpose of the present study is to assess immunohistochemical expression of cta mage-1 in tissue samples of invasive breast cancer and its correlation with known prognostic factors . \n a total of 113 patients with invasive breast cancer ( 112 ductal and one lobular ) were included . \n all patients were surgically treated at omid hospital in mashhad university of medical sciences , iran between 2011 and 2013 . \n data related to tumor size , grade , stage , estrogen receptor ( er ) and progesterone receptor ( pr ) status , human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 ( her-2/neu ) , and axillary lymph node status are summarized in table 1 . \n immunohistochemical staining of mage-1 was performed on the invasive breast cancer . for the detection of mage-1 protein \n , we used undiluted ncl - mage-1 monoclonal antibody ( mab ) , staining is described in detail elsewhere ( 14 ) . \n briefly , tissue slides from paraffin embedded breast cancer tumor samples were places on silane ( 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane , a 3648 , sigma , st . \n , slides were heated in an 800-w microwave oven at maximum power for 30 minutes , held in 10 mmol / l edta buffer ( ph 6.0 ) for 5 minutes and then rinsed with a tris buffer solution ( pbc , ph 7.2 ) . to suppress endogenous peroxidase activity , \n after additional rinsing with pbc , they were incubated for 20 minutes with a 1:10 dilution of normal rabbit serum ( dakox0902 , dako a / s ) in a wet chamber at room temperature for 20 minutes to prevent non - specific binding of immunoglobulin . \n slides were then treated with undiluted mabs at room temperature for 90 minutes . the envision ( dako ) \n system was used as a secondary detection tool and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride served as a chromogen . \n sections of normal human testis with intact spermiogenesis were used as positive controls for mage-1 mabs . \n this method takes into account percentages of positive cells ( scored on a 0 - 3 scale ) and the intensity of their staining ( scored on a 0 - 3 scale ) . the percentage of positive cells \n is then multiplied by the intensity of staining , and the final score ranges from 0 ( no staining ) to 9 ( diffuse and strong staining ) . \n the final results were further classified as 0 ( no staining ) , 1 ( score 1 , 2 , 3 ) , 2 ( score 4 , 5 , 6 ) and 3 ( score 7 , 8 , 9 ) . for statistical analysis , \n mage-1 scores of 0 and 1 were considered negative , whereas scores 2 and 3 were considered positive . \n the association between immunohistochemical data and different clinicopathological parameters were evaluated by chi2 and t -

3 scale ) and the intensity of their staining ( scored on a 0 - 3 scale ) . the percentage of positive cells \n is then multiplied by the intensity of staining , and the final score ranges from 0 ( no staining ) to 9 ( diffuse and strong staining ) . \n the final results were further classified as 0 ( no staining ) , 1 ( score 1 , 2 , 3 ) , 2 ( score 4 , 5 , 6 ) and 3 ( score 7 , 8 , 9 ) . for statistical analysis , \n mage-1 scores of 0 and 1 were considered negative , whereas scores 2 and 3 were considered positive . \n the association between immunohistochemical data and different clinicopathological parameters were evaluated by chi2 and t - test . a p value < 0.05 was considered significant . for all statistical analyses , \n the computer program spss 16 software ( spss for windows , 2007 ) was used . \n mage-1 expression ( score  2 + ) was detected in 34/111 ( 30.1% ) of patients ( figure 1 ) . \n a , strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of most of neoplastic cells ( h & e , 100  ) ; b , strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of most of neoplastic cells ( h & e , 100  ) . \n mage-1 expression ( score  2 + ) was detected in 36/111 ( 31.8% ) of patients ( figure 1 ) . \n expression of mage-1 was significantly associated with lymph node ( p = 0.003 ) breast cancers , but no association was found between mage-1 cytoplasmic expression and tumor size , age , her-2 status , tumor stage , grade , and er/ pr status . \n expression of mage-1 was significantly associated with tumor size ( p = 0.018 ) and lymph node ( p = 0.042 ) breast cancers . \n no association was found between mage-1 nuclear expression and age , her-2 status , tumor stage , grade , and er/ pr status . \n mage-1 expression ( score  2 + ) was detected in 34/111 ( 30.1% ) of patients ( figure 1 ) . \n a , strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of most of neoplastic cells ( h & e , 100  ) ; b , strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of most of neoplastic cells ( h & e , 100  ) . \n mage-1 expression ( score  2 + ) was detected in 36/111 ( 31.8% ) of patients ( figure 1 ) . \n table 3 presents associations between mage-1expression with clinicopathological variables . expression of mage-1 was significantly associated with lymph node ( p = 0.003 ) breast cancers , but no association was found between mage-1 cytoplasmic expression and tumor size , age , her-2 status , tumor stage , grade , and er/ pr status . \n expression of mage-1 was significantly associated with tumor size ( p = 0.018 ) and lymph node ( p = 0.042 ) breast cancers . \n no association was found between mage-1 nuclear expression and age , her-2 status , tumor stage , grade , and er/ pr status . \n breast cancer is among the leading causes of death in women worldwide ( 16 ) . \n the search for human tumor antigens as potential immunotherapeutic targets represents an appealing therapeutic concept since decades ago . \n recent advances in molecular characterization of human tumor - associated antigens have paved the way toward active specific immunotherapy of cancer ( 17 ) . \n ctas are of particular interest , because they are expressed in a very limited number of healthy tissues typically including hla class i negative spermatogonia , while they are expressed in a wide range of malignancies ( 18 ) . \n , we analyzed expression of mage-1 antigen on archival paraffin - embedded samples of invasive breast cancer tissue of 113 patients and correlated their expression with other clinicopathological variables . to our knowledge , this is the first report specifically examining expression of mage-1 , at the protein level , in breast cancer . \n mage-1 cytoplasmic expression ( score  2 + ) was detectable in 30.1% and nuclear expression ( score  2 + ) was detectable in 31.8% of patients . \n data on mage - a and ny - eso-1 expression in literature are highly variable . \n the frequency of multispecific mage - a and ny - eso-1 positivity in published studies ranges between 17 and 74% and 2% - 40% , respectively ( 2 ) . \n stefan found a 18% positive cta7 ( mage - c1 ) , defined as immunoreactivity in more than 50% of tumor cells , in 124 women with invasive breast cancer ( 16 ) . in the study of recurrent ductal breast cancer , bandic found 74% of mage - a and 40% of ny - eso-1-positivity in samples ( 19 ) . \n these discrepancies observed between studies may be due to different antibodies used for ct detection or difference in scoring system . \n some authors define positive x - cta expression according to percentage of cells ( 19 - 21 ) , while others combine the extent and intensity of cta expression using semi - quantitative scoring systems ( 22 , 23 ) . \n studies exploring potential prognostic significance of cta expression in breast cancer have yielded contradictory findings . \n some authors found that expression of cta is associated with poorly differentiated histological phenotypes ( 20 , 22 ) . \n others found no association between their expression and various pathological parameters ( 19 ) or only an association between mage - a1 and ki-67 labeling index ( 23 ) . according to the present study ( table 3 ) , \n a positive nuclear expression mage-1 status correlated significantly with lymph nodes status ( p = 0.042 ) , and positive cytoplasmic expression mage-1 status correlated significantly with lymph nodes ( ln ) status ( p = 0.003 ) . \n positive nuclear expression mage-1 status correlated significantly with tumor size ( p = 0.018 ) . \n however , the expression of mage-1 was not associated with other typical adverse clinicopathological features , namely tumor stage , and pathological grade . in badovinac crnjevic \n study ( 2 ) mage - a10 expression was significantly associated with er - negative ( p = 0.002 ) , pr - negative ( p = 0.002 ) and her-2-negative ( p = 0.044 ) tumors . \n they showed that mage - a10 was frequently expressed in the triple negative ( tn ) subgroup of patients , where the majority ( 85.7% ) of tumors expressed cta ( 19 ) . \n curigliano showed a significantly higher expression of mage - a ( 26% ) in tn breast cancers compared with er - positive tumors ( 10% ) ( p = 0.07 ) ( 23 ) . \n although the exact biological function of ctas is still unknown , future studies will hopefully allow more insights into the activities of ctas in tumor cells on the molecular level . in conclusion , due to mage-1 expression ( score  2 + ) in about 30% of our patients , even more frequent than her2 positivity in breast cancer",

      "document": "factor v is a coagulation protein that is present in blood plasma as a single - chain polypeptide ( approximately 80% ) and in platelet alpha - granules ( approximately 20%).1 factor v is cleaved after binding to activated platelets and serves as a cofactor for factor xa in the prothrombinase complex . \n this complex forms on the platelet surface and has limited proteolytic activity , converting prothrombin to thrombin to aid in blood clotting.2,3 acquired inhibitors to factor v were first reported in 195524 and develop in extremely rare cases ( 0.090.29 cases per million persons ) via development of alloantibodies or autoantibodies against factor v. patients with acquired factor v inhibitors generally present with hemorrhagic manifestations . \n here , we report a unique case of acquired factor v inhibitor in a patient with mantle cell lymphoma presenting with hematuria followed by thrombosis . \n a 64-year - old man initially presented to us with complaints of fatigue and joint discomfort for several months prior to december 2008 . \n he denied experiencing any fever , night sweats , and weight loss , and did not notice any swelling , recurrent infection , easy bleeding , or bruising . \n his past medical history included hernia repair , renal colic , gastroesophageal reflux , and osteoarthritis . upon examination , \n one left axillary lymph node was swollen to approximately 12 cm , and was firm and slightly tender . \n his spleen was palpable on inspiration , and castell s sign was positive ; however , his liver was not enlarged . \n a complete blood count showed normal platelet and hemoglobin levels of 206  10/l and 155 g / l , respectively , but a high white blood cell count of 18  10/l . \n a leukocyte differential indicated the following : lymphocytes 10.3 ; neutrophils 6.75 ; monocytes 0.58 ; eosinophils 0.23 ; and basophils 0.05 . \n peripheral blood flow cytometry revealed a cd19 , cd20 , cd5 , cd23 , cd10 clonal b - cell population . \n the proportion of this fmc7-positive population reduced to 17% during a second flow analysis one month later , suggesting the possibility of mantle cell lymphoma or cd23-negative chronic lymphoid leukemia . \n given that the patient was asymptomatic and showed no signs of bone marrow failure , a strategy of watchful waiting was implemented . in august 2009 , 8 months after his initial visit , the patient was admitted to the emergency room with a 2-day history of hematuria . \n evaluation of his blood plasma revealed a prolonged international normalized ratio ( inr ) of 6 and an activated partial thromboplastin time of 160 seconds . except for some minor skin bruising on his face , the patient had no other bleeding or bruising , nor was any area abnormal on examination . \n further , he had no past history of bleeding , with uneventful surgical procedures and tooth extractions in the past . on careful investigation of his coagulopathy , \n a prothrombin time mixing study was abnormal at 43 partially corrected to 30 seconds only ( normal 12.515.7 seconds ) , suggesting the presence of an inhibitor . \n the thrombin time was 15.8 seconds ( normal 15.518.3 seconds ) , serum fibrinogen level was 5.8 \n g / l ) , factor v level was < 0.01 u / ml ( normal 0.51.5 u / ml ) , factor viii level was 3.23 u / ml ( normal 0.51.5 u / ml ) , factor x level was 1.08 u / ml ( normal 0.51.5 u / ml ) , and factor ix level was 1.17 u / ml ( normal 0.51.5 u / ml ) . \n based on these results , a factor v inhibitor test was performed and indicated a factor v inhibitor titer of 80 bethesda units . \n the patient was started on prednisone ( 1 mg / kg , 80 mg daily ) , and after 2 weeks of treatment , the bleeding had stopped and serial measurement of factor v levels showed a dramatic increase ; moreover , within 7 weeks , factor v levels were normal and factor v inhibitor was undetectable . surprisingly , 7 weeks after initiation of steroid treatment , the patient developed an unprovoked severe pain with swelling in his right leg . a week prior to this event , his prothrombin time was 17 seconds , activated partial thromboplastin time was 28 seconds , inr was 1.4 , and the factor v assay value was 0.62 bethesda units / ml , but factor v inhibitor was undetectable . \n doppler ultrasound revealed deep venous thrombosis , and low - molecular - weight heparin ( dalteparin , 12,500 u ) and coumadin ( 7.5 mg ) were administered orally once daily . \n the patient s condition continued to improve with no further bleeding or thrombotic events , and anticoagulation was successfully discontinued after 8 months . \n the use of prednisone was gradually decreased over several weeks after confirmation of the disappearance of the inhibitor , and was discontinued completely in december 2009 ( figure 1 ) . screening assays to rule out \n inherited thrombophilia were negative for antithrombin , protein c , protein s , factor v leiden , and prothrombin 20210 gene mutations . \n fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of a peripheral blood sample showed igh / ccnd1 t(11;14 ) , which confirmed the presence of a clonal b - cell population characteristic of mantle cell lymphoma . \n the clinical presentation of factor v inhibitors can range from asymptomatic hematological laboratory abnormalities to life - threatening hemorrhage . \n factor v inhibitor has been associated with a number of conditions , including antibiotic use , sepsis , malignancies,10 autoimmune illnesses , vasculitis , valproic acid use , systemic amyloidosis , cold agglutinin disease , human immunodeficiency virus infection , hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , and liver transplantation , as well as use of amiodarone and warfarin.2,1113 if bleeding occurs , it predominantly involves the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal , airway , and urinary tracts.2 in contrast with other coagulation factor inhibitors , the level of factor v inhibitors does not correlate with the degree of clinical bleeding , and streiff et al noted that patients who developed spontaneous factor v inhibitors had more significant bleeding than those with bovine thrombin - related factor v inhibitors.14 in addition , the risk of bleeding does not seem to correlate with prolongation of prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time , factor v activity , factor v inhibitor levels , or the duration of presence of factor v inhibitor.14 because factor v is an anticoagulant , reports of thrombosis in patients with acquired factor v inhibitor are extremely rare.59 activated factor v ( fva ) is subsequently inactivated by activated protein c ( apc ) , which cleaves fva at arg506 , arg306 , and arg679 . \n after fva is cleaved at arg506 ( fvac ) , it further interacts with apc and protein s to enhance the inactivation of activated factor viii ( fviiia ) by the aps / protein s complex , thereby indirectly acting as an anticoagulant.15,16 factor v inhibitor can hinder this cascade by decreasing the level of fvac , resulting in sustained activation of factor viii and leading to procoagulant diathesis . \n interestingly , an anti - factor v antibody isolated from a patient inhibited the cofactor activity of factor v during the apc / protein s complex s fviiia inactivation cascade by impairing the proper cleavage of fva by apc and inhibiting the inactivation of fva.17 this confirms that factor v inhibitors can lead to procoagulant diathesis by both direct and indirect mechanisms . \n given that the factor v inhibitor was undetectable in our patient , it is unlikely that it elicited the development of thrombosis during the course of treatment , but we hypothesize that the significantly elevated factor viii might have played a role . additionally , underlying hematological malignancy is another possible provoking factor . \n the patient presented in this case report had a unique clinical manifestation of acquired factor v inhibitor in that thrombosis occurred after factor v was no longer detectable by an assay measuring bethesda units ; however , the patient still exhibited coagulopathy with high prothrombin time and inr , suggesting the continued presence of a small amount of factor v inhibitor . at first presentation , \n his factor viii level was significantly higher than normal at 3.23 u / ml ( normal 0.51.5 u / ml ) which might have caused this thrombotic event . to our knowledge , this is the first report of acquired factor v inhibitor in a patient with mantle cell lymphoma simultaneously presenting with this unusual coagulopathy .",

      "document": "Many people who have normal blood pressure experience anxiety-induced spikes in the doctor\u2019s office that can give the impression of hypertension, or white-coat hypertension. It is considered somewhat common.\n\nIf you think you are in that category, you should first establish whether your suspicion is indeed correct, said Dr. Sheldon G. Sheps, an emeritus professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nBlood pressure can rise or fall throughout the day depending on a number of factors. So doctors recommend that you take multiple readings under normal circumstances to get a good idea of your blood pressure outside the clinic.\n\nIf you are checking your blood pressure at home, for example, do it in the early morning or evening, and don\u2019t eat or exercise directly beforehand. Take a seat in a comfortable chair for a few minutes with your legs uncrossed and your upper arm at heart level. Take three readings at intervals of one minute or longer, then calculate the average. Do this once or twice a day over several days to get a more accurate picture.\n\nAt the doctor\u2019s office, an average reading of 140/90 or greater is considered Stage 1 hypertension. At home, however, the upper limit of healthy blood pressure is considered to be 135/85.\n\nIn the past, white-coat hypertension was often dismissed as not very serious. But now research suggests that as many as half of all people who exhibit the phenomenon eventually develop the real thing.\n\n\u201cMost of us think that it does progress to established hypertension over time,\u201d Dr. Sheps said.\n\nThere is evidence that in elderly patients who exhibit white-coat hypertension, blood pressure medication can reduce the likelihood of cardiac events, Dr. Sheps added. But for the average person, medication is probably not immediately necessary.\n\nIt is better to start with other measures that can lower blood pressure, like losing weight, cutting back on alcohol and increasing exercise. Continue monitoring your blood pressure to see if these changes make a difference, and work with your doctor to determine whether you might eventually need to take medication.",

      "document": "despite significant advances in our understanding of paediatric pain and the publication of pain management guidelines by several leading paediatric bodies in recent years , multiple studies and reviews show that pain in children continues to be poorly managed . as maclean et al . \n ( 2007 ) note ,  there remains a gap between what we know to be effective , easily implemented pain management strategies , and what is actually practiced  . \n given these findings are based on their review of pain management practices in a paediatric teaching hospital in a high income country , it is perhaps not surprising this gap is larger in low income countries where resources , in their broadest sense , are more constrained . some barriers to managing a child 's pain are common to a wide variety of health care settings , such as lack of provider training in the recognition , assessment and management of pain , and attitudes and beliefs regarding pain and its management . \n other barriers likely play a significant role mainly in low income countries where resources in terms of manpower , equipment , and medications , are in chronic short supply and must be balanced across the competing needs of patients presenting to providers practicing in these settings . despite these issues , \n given the current state of knowledge in this area , and the wide variety of options now available for managing paediatric pain , many of these barriers can be overcome through adaptation of published guidelines to address the unique needs and barriers of specific health care settings . \n this paper describes the development of a paediatric analgesia and sedation protocol , tailored to the specific setting of the medical research council ( mrc ) paediatric ward in the gambia , west africa . \n although a combined paediatric and adult protocol was ultimately developed , only the paediatric portion is reported here . \n for clarity of presentation , the protocol development process will be described in 3 steps . \n however , it is important to note , that an iterative process was employed beginning with a recognized need to improve pain management expressed by local clinical staff , and with feedback from local providers sought and incorporated throughout the development process . \n as noted above , protocol development began with an expressed desire for a pain management protocol tailored to the mrc paediatric ward , to facilitate efforts by clinical staff toward improving pain management . \n as a first step , key local informants including the senior clinician of the hospital , the matron , and another senior nurse , were interviewed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the hospitals resources , current practices and staff level of training , medication availability , and cost implications . \n two important considerations emerged from this consultation process , which were shortage of airway support capabilities and limited staff training in pain assessment and monitoring . to further assess the airway capabilities on the ward \n , sufficient airway equipment was located to organize two complete airway kits , which included oral airways , bag - valve - masks , intubation medications and equipment . \n discussions with physician and nursing staff , revealed both had little training or experience in pain management . for this reason it was felt that a more directive and structured protocol , with a strong educational component to accompany roll out of the protocol was needed . the second step in development of the protocol began with a review of published paediatric analgesia and sedation guidelines , the evidence base for their development where possible , and consultation with experts in paediatric sedation and analgesia . \n as most published guidelines were developed in and for high income health care settings , during the review process and again in consultation with key local informants a list of issues relevant to paediatric pain management on the mrc ward was identified . \n concerns were identified with respect to several unique attributes of the gambian population , specifically the relative high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies [ 3 , 4 ] and under - nutrition particularly in the first 2 years of life . \n it was notable that despite the importance of cultural in perceptions and beliefs with respect to pain , no cultural issues were identified as important to pain management efforts in this setting . \n hemoglobinopathies , like sickle cell anemia and glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency ( g6pd ) , are relatively common in the gambia [ 3 , 4 ] and present challenges for managing pain . many established guidelines and experts \n recommend against sedation in sickle disease patients , and sickle trait patients with low oxygen saturations , unless anaesthesia is in attendance . \n given anaesthesia support is not available at the mrc , these were included as absolute contraindications to sedation in the mrc protocol . \n of additional concern is the potential for local anaesthetic induced methemoglobinemia . for a variety of reasons , including effectiveness , \n hemodynamic safety requiring no special monitoring , and availability of inexpensive preparations , local anaesthetics are ideal for management of brief painful procedures . \n while a variety of local anaesthetics have been reported to induce methemoglobinemia , reported cases have occurred mainly in very young infants or where excessive quantities of topical anaesthetic are used . \n although an uncommon complication and relatively easily managed in the general population with methylene blue , treatment of methemoglobinemia is significantly more complicated in individuals with g6pd deficiency where methylene blue can cause acute hemolysis and more intensive care , including exchange transfusions , may be required . \n given the high incidence of g6pd in the gambian population , cost and time required for testing , and potential for this serious complication whose treatment is beyond the resource capacity of the setting , use of topical anaesthetics was strictly limited to children at least 6 months of age and within recommended dosing guidelines . \n guidelines and experts generally recommend 3 months of age corrected for prematurity ; however , given the prevalence of under - nutrition and difficulties in accurately assessing both age of gestation and date of birth in this setting , the age restriction was broadened to ensure minimum safety guidelines were observed . \n based on the findings of the first two stages of protocol development outlined above , a draft protocol was created and circulated to key local informants and an expert in paediatric pain management for feedback and amendment . perhaps not surprising considering the iterative nature of the development process , with the exception noted below , no major changes were suggested . at this stage \n the draft appeared as a numbered list of process steps with considerations at each step outlined within the section . \n for example , within the analgesia section , all available options were listed with their indications , contraindications , and dosages . while this format was modelled after other published protocols , and meant to emphasize options and provider choice , feedback from key local informants suggested that a more limited and algorithmic approach , presented as a flow chart would facilitate adoption of the protocol , particularly early on in the course of the campaign to improve pain management . \n based on this feedback the protocol was reworked into a flow chart ( see figure 1 ) , with the original protocol with small amendments included as a detailed reference or guide . \n the amended draft was again circulated to key local informants and the pain management expert , with no further revisions suggested . as a final step in the development of the protocol , \n the protocol was presented to the physician group at academic rounds , and at a staff meeting to the nursing and health attendant staff , with minor changes to the protocol incorporated as a result of feedback from these sessions . \n in addition to the final product , that is , the paediatric pain management protocol tailored to the mrc ward , other benefits were gained through the process of development . as a result of the equipment survey , \n two airway kits were created and placed together with other basic resuscitation equipment into a strategic location within the unit for ready access . \n equally important is early evidence that through the educational and feedback sessions , further interest in improving patient care was fostered among clinical staff . as one physician reported \n i encountered a case today where i would normally not have considered pain management , but after the session the other day , i decided i better do something .  as clemmer and spuhler ( 1998 ) have argued , \n the purpose of creating protocols is greater than reducing practice variation , it also creates new paradigms and changes the culture in which health care is delivered , with the protocol itself designed to be transient , and the development process and the changes it produces , more important than the product itself    . \n however , to ensure successful implementation of the protocol and ongoing improvements in paediatric pain management , further steps are needed . \n ongoing education of clinical staff , particularly early in the implementation process and as new staff are hired , is essential to ensure safe and appropriate pain management procedures . \n intermittent reassessment and revision based on experiences in using the protocol is needed to allow for adaptation as the needs of the patients served and the resources and options available change . \n despite some progress in recent years , pain continues to be undertreated globally , particularly in children , and particularly in low income countries . \n published guidelines based on best available evidence , can and should be adapted to allow for optimal pain management given the resources and capabilities of a given health care setting . \n it is hoped that the development process and protocol described here will not only help to improve care on the mrc ward , but serve as an example to others working toward improving pain management in similar health care settings .",

      "document": "bone scintigraphy is an important modality for the examination of various pathological conditions of the skeletal system . \n radionuclide bone imaging is quick , relatively inexpensive , widely available , and exquisitely sensitive and is invaluable in the diagnostic evaluation of numerous pathological conditions . \n these compounds accumulate rapidly in bone , and by 2 - 6 h after injection , about 50% of the injected dose is in the skeletal system . \n tc - methylene diphosphonate ( tc - mdp ) imaging , customarily directed toward identifying altered skeletal metabolism , has been used extensively to image a variety of extraosseous lesions , especially heterotopic ossification and metabolic , metastatic calcification . \n we report a rare case of accumulation of bone scintigraphy tracer in a phlebolith in a patient of adenocarcinoma of lung . \n a 43-year - old female patient , known case of adenocarcinoma of right lung was referred for a tc - mdp bone scan with complaint of persistent low backache since 3 months . \n the scan showed abnormal , focal increased tracer uptake in left pelvic cavity , not localizing to any bone of the skeleton [ figures 1a and b , arrows ] . \n the uptake was persistent even in post - void imaging done after adequate hydration , giving us a clue that it was not due to tracer hold up in the ureter . on single photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography ( spect - ct ) imaging , \n the focal tracer uptake localized to a small focus of calcification in the left pelvic cavity away from the ureter [ figure 2 , arrow ] . \n an additional ultrasonography of the pelvis confirmed that there was no ureteric calculus [ figure 3 ] . \n review of the patient 's recent contrast - enhanced computed tomography revealed a phlebolith in left iliac vein ( ct hounsfield unit : 338 ) . \n thus , we concluded the extraosseous tc - mdp uptake was due to phlebolith in the left iliac vein . \n planar bone scan ( a and b ) of a 43-year - old female patient , a known case of adenocarcinoma of right lung . \n focal , intense tracer uptake seen in left pelvic cavity ( arrow ) correlative single photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography fusion imaging localized this uptake to a phlebolith in left iliac vein ( arrow ) ultrasonography of the pelvis showing ureteric jets bilaterally ( arrows ) , ruling out obstruction ( calculus ) in the ureter \n tc - mdp , a bone scan tracer , has rapid blood clearance , excellent in vivo chemical stability , and a high bone - to - soft tissue ratio , which are ideal for bone imaging . \n although tc - mdp is customarily used to evaluate skeletal pathological conditions , its excellent clearance from normal soft tissues allows the detection of abnormal extraskeletal tc - mdp accumulation . \n it is hypothesized that tc - mdp and its analogues bind to bone by adsorption to the surface of the hydroxyapatite crystal . while in soft tissue , \n these pathways result in uptake of tc - mdp through what is believed to be chemisorption of the radiopharmaceutical onto the surface of the calcium salts . \n phleboliths are deposits which develop in the wall of a vein and are composed of calcium or lime . \n these are most commonly seen in the lower pelvis and sometime occur in large numbers . \n they are often confused with ureteric stones when seen around the urinary bladder in the pelvic cavity . however \n , on plain radiographs , these can be distinguished from a calculus due to the presence of a translucent center and circular or oval shape.[810 ] bone scan tracer uptake in a phlebolith has been described in past . \n dystrophic calcification occurs in patients with normal ca + and po4 levels and refers to ca + deposition in tissues secondary to histological disruption caused by trauma , ischemia , or cellular necrosis or in the enzymatic necrosis of fat . \n it is thought that calcium ion binds to phospholipids present in membrane bound vesicles , phosphatases generate phosphate groups which in turn bind to the calcium , and the cycle is repeated until local concentrations are elevated and crystals begin to form . \n hyaline collagen degeneration , a consequence of tissue damage , is particularly associated with ca + deposition . \n similar mechanism operates in other known causes of extraskeletal bone scan tracer uptake in tissue infarction , deep vein thrombosis , scars , and dermatomyositis . to conclude \n , we report a rare case of extraosseous uptake of bone scan tracer in a phlebolith . with growing use of integration of ct with spect \n , nuclear medicine physicians should become aware of such anatomical changes and variants so as to avoid misinterpretation . \n the awareness of the underlying pathophysiological basis of these changes and uptake of mdp in extraosseous soft tissue can significantly enhance the interpretation and diagnostic value of bone scintigraphy .",

similarly , right ureter was thickened and necrotic from l5 to s3 level , retroperitoneal tissue around these ureters was grossly normal . \n frozen sections from the ureteric wall on both sides were reported as caseating granulomatous inflammation and later confirmed on routine histopathology . \n an ileal segment was used to replace the involved ureteric segments from l3 level to the bladder and she was started on 4 drug antitubercular therapy ( att ) , with which she showed clinical improvement ( absence of fever , malaise and flank pain ) . \n six months later , creatinine was 0.66 mg% and follow up ultrasound of abdomen 6 months and 18 months post surgery showed resolution of bilateral hydronephrosis . \n she was continued on att beyond 6 months as evaluation for headache revealed an intracranial right cavernous sinus lesion which was not amenable to biopsy and was presumed to be tubercular in etiology . \n bilateral synchronous mid - ureteric lesions are rare and may be congenital , or iatrogenic , following radiotherapy or aortic aneurysmal surgery . \n bilateral ureteric involvement with acute renal injury has been described due to radiation - induced mid- and lower ureteric strictures ; however , bilateral synchronous mid - ureteric tubercular strictures without obvious radiological renal or bladder involvement as a cause for acute renal injury has not been described in literature . \n urinary system involvement in tuberculosis is commonly unilateral , probably due to delayed reactivation of a solitary focus . \n ureteric involvement is considered secondary to renal involvement , with the vesicoureteric junction being the most commonly involved . \n tuberculosis usually involves the intramural part of the ureteric wall and is characterized by ureteric thickening and post contrast ureteric wall enhancement on contrast - enhanced computed tomography . bilateral involvement with renal failure \n is commonly seen after descending infection from one renal unit involving the bladder and subsequent contralateral unit damage due to vesicoureteric reflux and/or small capacity poorly compliant bladder . \n this case is unique in many respects and can not be easily explained by accepted theories on the etiopathogenesis of urinary tuberculosis . \n there was bilateral , synchronous involvement of the mid - ureter , which , according to existing literature , is the least commonly involved ureteric segment in urinary tb . \n this can only be explained by taking into account the following facts : bilateral pathological involvement of the urinary system via hematogenous route is not unusual ; in fact , a seminal study by medlar found bilateral pathological involvement to be the rule , rather than the exception and renal tuberculosis can be clinically silent . \n involvement of bilateral ureteric segments either by direct hematogenous spread or following bacilluria from an undetectable renal lesion and subsequent simultaneous activation can explain the findings of the case . \n the interaction between host immunity and pathogenicity decides the clinical presentation . at one end of spectrum \n is the activation of a single focus of tuberculosis even in the presence of multiple tubercular pathological foci and at the other end is disseminated tuberculosis where more than one tubercular foci become clinically apparent simultaneously . in the case \n described above , the simultaneous clinical activation of two pathological foci and later on presentation of an intracranial lesion suggests this patient 's immune response lay somewhere midway along the spectrum . \n the presence of caseating necrotizing granulomatous inflammation is almost always associated with tuberculosis and rarely with nocardiosis ( where granuloma formation is rare ) ; however , the clinical features ( no solid organ abscesses , response to att ) are not consistent with the latter . if tuberculosis had been entertained as a differential diagnosis , appropriate microbiological work up could have been initiated and if proven positive , the patient would have benefited from a 4 to 6 week course of anti - tubercular therapy prior to treatment for ureteric stricture , if it failed to resolve with medical therapy .",

Mr. Shaw and Ms. Lederer are married.\n\nThe three dismissed Mr. Ehrlich in February 2000 after a history of tensions. Mr. Ehrlich sued and won a $611,000 judgment. After years of appeals and bankruptcy hearings, a December deadline arrived for Mr. Shaw's and Ms. Lederer's instruments -- a 1915 Ferruccio Varagnolo viola, and an 1887 Eugenio Degani cello along with an 1860 bow by Nicolaus Kittel -- to be sold to raise money to pay the judgment.\n\nBut after a round of news reports, the two sides agreed to settle the case. A key aspect of the settlement was Mr. Ehrlich's acceptance of a $200,000 payment in exchange for dropping his claim on the instruments.\n\nMr. Braden said that after learning of the circumstances, he approached Ms. Lederer and Mr. Shaw, offering to buy their instruments for that amount. In exchange, they would have the guaranteed use of them for 10 years.\n\n\"I needed them to feel there are a couple of things in their lives that are guaranteed,\" Mr. Braden said, adding that the two musicians have the option to buy back the instruments at a set price for a period of time, which he did not disclose. After 10 years, he said, they will discuss the next step.\n\n\"I want to make it very clear, I'm not a donor,\" he said. \"I'm buying the instruments and loaning them back to them.\" But, he added, \"I have great sympathy for what this has meant and done to them emotionally.\"\n\nMr. Braden said that for about two decades starting in the early 1980's, he did tax work for musicians and worked as a business manager for a New York violin dealer. He invested his earnings in the 90's, he said, adding, \"The stock market was very good to me.\"\n\nNow a violinist in the Berlin Philharmonic, a cellist in the Pittsburgh Opera and a violinist in the Lehigh Valley Chamber Orchestra, in which Mr. Braden also plays, are borrowing his instruments, he said.\n\nAs part of the settlement with Mr. Ehrlich, which was signed on Friday, Mr. Shaw and Ms. Lederer must vacate their house in Blacksburg, Va., by March 15 and turn it over to the bankruptcy trustee for sale. Mr. Ehrlich is to receive the proceeds, expected to be more than $200,000, as well as $59,000 in liquidated retirement annuities from the couple.\n\nThe couple also rent a home in Winchester, Va., where they teach at Shenandoah University's conservatory. They live in Blacksburg because until the lawsuit, the quartet had residency at Virginia Tech, which is based there.\n\nMs. Takayama reached a separate deal to pay $40,000 to Mr. Ehrlich, Mr. Shaw said.\n\n\"This is it, as far as I'm concerned,\" Mr. Shaw said, referring to the end of the lawsuit. \"When we played a concert Friday night, Akemi and I and Doris looked at each other and said, 'Oh, my God, we're finished.' \"",

      "document": "At a faster rate than many expected, the post-Arab Spring\u2019s Islamist governments are stumbling.\n\nFor weeks, President Mohammad Mursi has faced increasingly violent opposition in Egypt. And now the Islamist rulers of Tunisia, the birthplace of the Arab Spring, are facing growing unrest.\n\nAcross the country once considered the region\u2019s best hope for democracy, mass protests and political paralysis have erupted following the assassination of a leading secular politician on Wednesday.\n\nThe anger and grief at Chokri Belaid\u2019s death is real, according to this piece by my colleague Tarek Amara in Tunis. But it is also a reflection of the growing divide between secular Tunisians and the ruling Islamist party Ennahda.\n\nSixteen months after Ennahda swept elections and pledged to work with secularists, the two sides are increasingly divided. Ennahda said its supporters played no role in the assassination of Belaid as he walked out of his home and got into his car Wednesday morning. But many secular Tunisians say they believe Ennahda played a role in the murder, citing Belaid\u2019s role as a staunch Ennahda critic.\n\nSplits are even emerging in Ennahda itself. After the shooting, Tunisia\u2019s Prime Minister, an Ennhada member, agreed to a long-standing demand from the secular opposition that a government of non-political technocrats be formed before elections expected to be held this spring or summer. A day later, the leader of Ennahda\u2019s political party rejected the Prime Minister\u2019s decision, creating more confusion.\n\n\u201cPolitical analysts said protracted deadlock could aggravate the unrest, which has underscored the chasm between Islamists,\u201d Amara wrote, \u201cand secular groups who fear that freedoms of expression, cultural liberty and women\u2019s rights are in jeopardy just two years after the Western-backed dictatorship crumbled.\u201d\n\nThe problem goes beyond politics, according to Tunisian journalists. The Ennahda-led government has failed to revive the economy or provide effective government services. The two sides have been unable to strike a compromise on the role of Islam in the country\u2019s new constitution. And secularists say Ennahda has failed to crackdown on hardline Salafists who have carried out a series of violent attacks on liquor stores, art shows and secular Tunisians.\n\n\u201cThey have never been held accountable and never been put in jail,\u201d Zied Mhirsi, co-founder of the website Tunisia Live and a radio host, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis all very worrisome to Tunisians.\u201d\n\nShadi Hamid, research director at the Brookings Doha Center, argued in the Washington Post Thursday that the problem was not Ennahda\u2019s performance in Tunisia or the performance of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Hamid, who was in Tunis, said polarization between the region\u2019s secular and Islamist political groups was inevitable. He argued that what is occurring is not chaos, it is an epic power struggle.\n\n\u201cThere is a fundamental ideological divide in the Arab world \u2014 let\u2019s not pretend that it\u2019s purely political,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a battle for the future of these countries and what they should look like.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are enormous. Stay tuned.\n\nPHOTO: Soldiers help mourners carry the coffin of slain opposition leader Chokri Belaid during his funeral procession towards the nearby cemetery of El-Jellaz, where he is to be buried, in the Jebel Jelloud district of Tunis, February 8, 2013.

      "document": "chronic itch , which is defined as itch lasting more than 6 weeks , is a prevalent problem that occurs in ~10% of the population ( mollanazar et al . , 2015 ) . \n chronic itch conditions negatively affect quality of life , and yet there are no therapies that are both efficacious and selective for itch . \n the lack of effective treatment is partly attributable to a poor understanding of the mechanisms that underlie it . \n although antihistamines are frequently prescribed as a treatment for itch , they are typically ineffective because most types of chronic itch are not histamine - mediated ( mollanazar et al . , 2015 ) . \n unfortunately , while there are numerous mediators that can cause itch , the factors that are responsible in most circumstances of chronic itch are largely unknown . \n human psychophysical studies have shown that application of serotonin into the skin causes itch ( weisshaar et al . , 2004 ) . \n in rodents , serotonin is a key component of mast cells , and it is a potent mediator of itch . \n however , until recently , the mechanisms through which serotonin causes itch have remained uncertain . \n many pruritogens bind to metabotropic receptors on primary sensory neurons ; however , these receptors must be coupled to ionotropic channels via intracellular signaling pathways in order to allow sufficient current influx to generate action potentials . \n several groups have shown that the cation channels trpv1 and trpa1 are coupled to different pruritogen receptors and that they are critical for different forms of itch transmission ( ross , 2011 ) . \n more specifically , trpv1 is required for histaminergic itch , whereas trpa1 is required for several types of non - histaminergic itch , such as that induced by chloroquine , bam8 - 22 , il-31 , endothelin-1 , thymic stromal lymphopoietin , and bile acids . until recently , whether serotonin receptors were likewise coupled to trps remained unknown . \n understanding serotonin - mediated itch has been complicated by the fact that there are numerous serotonin receptors that are expressed on primary afferents , as well as on immune mediators that could be involved in itch . \n it was previously hypothesized that the primary pathway through which serotonin causes itch is via stimulation of histamine release from mast cells . \n however , contrary to this idea , antihistamines failed to reduce serotonin - induced itch sensation in humans ( hosogi et al . , 2006 ) . \n a recent study has demonstrated that one way in which serotonin induces itch is via direct activation of 5-ht7 ( encoded by htr7 ) , which is expressed on subsets of primary sensory afferents ( morita et al . , 2015 ) . \n in this study , mice lacking either htr7 or trpa1 showed substantially reduced scratching behavior in response to an intradermal injection of a 5-ht7-selective agonist . furthermore , htr7 and trpa1 knockout mice scratched considerably less in a model of atopic dermatitis . however , it seemed likely that this was only part of the serotonin - itch story , because the 5-ht2-selective agonist , -methyl-5ht , is a potent pruritogen in mice . \n as reported in this issue of jid , the study by carstens and colleagues ( 2015 ) provides further insight into the molecular players involved in serotonin - evoked itch by defining a trpv4-dependent pathway that is likely to be downstream of 5-ht2-mediated itch . \n the original goal of this study was to investigate a possible role for trpv4 in itch . \n trpv4 is upregulated in the skin of individuals with certain itch conditions ( moore et al . , 2013 ; yang et al . , 2015 \n interestingly , trpv4 knockout mice displayed a significant reduction in scratching behavior in response to serotonin , but not to histamine , chloroquine , or sligrl ( akiyama et al . \n a trpv4 antagonist also reduced substantially the amount of serotonin - evoked scratching , supporting the idea that trpv4 is critical to serotonin signaling in normal mice . \n importantly , the authors showed that the change in response to serotonin in the trpv4 knockout mice was specifically a decrease in serotonin - evoked itch behaviors , and not a change in serotonin - evoked pain behaviors . \n this study demonstrates that trpv4 is a key downstream component of serotonin - evoked itch ( figure 1 ) . in order to link serotonin to trpv4 and the activation of sensory neurons \n serotonin - mediated activation was dependent on trpv4 , as a trpv4 antagonist reduced significantly the calcium response to the application of serotonin . in support of this finding \n , the authors demonstrated that the proportion of neurons that responded to serotonin was reduced significantly in trpv4 knockout mice . \n interestingly , the proportion of neurons responding to other types of pruritogens did not change in mice lacking trpv4 , indicating that trpv4 plays an important and specific role in responses to serotonin in primary sensory neurons . to identify the receptor through which serotonin acts , akiyama et al . \n the 5-ht2 antagonist , but not the 5-ht1 antagonist , reduced serotonin - evoked scratching . \n this finding raises the possibility that 5-ht2 , acting via trpv4 , is key mediator of serotonin - evoked itch . \n thus , there appear to be at least two distinct pathways through which serotonin mediates itch : a trpa1-dependant pathway that mediates 5-ht7-mediated itch , as well as a trpv4-dependent pathway that likely mediates 5-ht2-mediated itch . \n what remains to be tested is whether these receptors are expressed on distinct or overlapping populations of primary sensory afferents .",
      "summary": "previous studies have revealed that trpv1 and trpa1 function downstream of many itch receptors , where they mediate inward current to trigger action potentials in primary afferents . although other trp channels , such as trpv4 , are expressed in primary afferents , whether or not they play an analogous role in itch was previously unknown . \n now , akiyama et al . \n provide evidence that trpv4 is a key mediator of serotonin - induced itch . \n this finding is important because it uncovers an unanticipated role for trpv4 in itch , thereby identifying a novel therapeutic target .",

41 - 5171 ) and by the data protection board of the danish central region ( record number 1 - 16 - 02 - 1 - 08 ) . in sweden , \n the stockholm county regional ethics review board approved the study ( record number 2010/1617 - 31/3 ) . according to danish and swedish law , informed consent from patients is not required for registry - based studies . \n overall , 221 potential cases were identified ; of these , 32 patients had missing information in the medical record or the medical record file could not be found ( figure 1 ) . \n medical records were available for 189 patients ( 86% ) , including 100 potential cases of dermatologic events ( mean age 77 years ) and 89 potential cases for hypersensitivity ( mean age 76 years ; tables 1 and 2 ) . \n of these , 8 potential cases ( 8% ) with dermatologic events and 6 potential cases with hypersensitivity ( 7% ) \n had insufficient information for medical adjudication and were not included in the ppv calculations ( table 3 ) . \n information verifying a dermatologic event leading to hospitalization or emergency room visit was found in 85 of 92 medical records , yielding a ppv of 92.4% ( 95% ci , 85.1%96.3% ; table 3 ) . \n the ppv was substantially lower for bullous dermatoses ( 52.5% [ 95% ci 37.5%67.1 ] ) as well as for erythematous pathological subtype ( 12.5% [ 95% ci 2.2%47.1% ] ; table 3 ) . \n hypersensitivity leading to hospitalization or emergency room visits was confirmed in 49 of 83 medical records , yielding a ppv of 59.0% ( 95% ci : 48.3%69.0% ) . \n the ppv was 100.0% ( 95% ci , 67.6%100% ) for hypersensitivity when restricting ppv calculation to codes for anaphylaxis . \n the overall ppvs of dermatologic events and hypersensitivity were comparable in denmark and sweden ( table 4 ) . \n among women with pmo in denmark and sweden , we adjudicated hospital - based primary diagnoses of dermatologic events and hypersensitivity leading to hospitalization or emergency room visit coded in national patient registries . \n the higher ppv for dermatologic events than for hypersensitivity may reflect differences in the complexity of the disease definition and that 50% of the potential dermatologic event cases originated from specialist departments of dermatology , whereas > 90% of the potential hypersensitivity cases originated from departments of internal medicine and emergency rooms . \n the term hypersensitivity was often found to be used for normal physiological reactions of overdoses , for example , a high international normalized ratio ( inr ) as a result of too much warfarin . \n most likely this mirrors the lack of time to find a more correct code . to the best of our knowledge , \n our study is the first to estimate the ppv of icd-10 codes for identifying patients with dermatologic events and hypersensitivity in the danish and swedish national patient registries . \n only 2 studies have assessed the validity of icd-10 codes for skin diseases in the danish national patient registry with medical records as reference . \n a study of 38 cancer patients estimated a ppv almost as high as ours , 79% ( 95% ci , 64%90% ) for skin infections when using an abstraction form and physician assessment in the same manner as done in our study , but the ppv was lower when confirmed by evidence - based criteria ( 45% , 95% ci , 30%60% ) , requiring , for example , at least 7 days of antibiotics.5 another study of 589 stroke patients validated several medical complications , among them the diagnosis of decubitus using a standardized abstraction form , but without physician assessment . with only 8 cases in the danish national patient registry , where 4 were verified , \n the ppv was found to be 50% ( 95% ci , 16%84% ) for decubitus.4 skin disease codes in the swedish national patient registry have only been evaluated in 1 previous study.13 among children younger than 17 years , who were prescribed glucocorticoid or immunosuppressant medication recorded in the swedish prescribed drug register , the ppvs were 82% for unspecific dermatitis ( n=199 ) and 45% for the eczema ( n=108 ) , with medical record review conducted by physicians as reference standard.13 in 2012 , the american food and drug administration ( fda ) conducted a systematic review of us studies validating algorithms for anaphylaxis and related conditions . \n they concluded that more research is needed ; more validation studies to test anaphylaxis algorithms need to be conducted . \n they found only 6 studies , with varying ppvs ( 38%72% ) depending on cohorts and icd codes used.14 taken together , the literature in the area is limited and methods to validate differ . \n the danish and swedish national patient registries offer a variety of possibilities for pharmacoepidemiologic studies.10 based on our findings , the national patient registries can be used to study cohorts of patients with dermatologic events as well as postmarketing monitoring of dermatologic events and hypersensitivity of treatments . \n however , the low ppv of our algorithm for identifying hypersensitivity leading to hospitalization or emergency room visits is not adequate for monitoring in pharmacovigilance studies if absolute risk is the outcome of interest . in comparative safety studies \n , however , relative risks should be unbiased if specificity of the diagnosis is high and misclassification is nondifferential across exposure categories.15 \n this study was conducted among women with pmo in selected areas and hospitals of denmark and sweden . \n scandinavian countries are welfare states with universal income - independent access to health care and uniform health care delivery . \n hence , results of this validation study are likely generalizable to the overall postmenopausal female population in each country , although variation across geography and hospital size can not be ruled out . by design , \n this study assessed ppvs and could not assess sensitivity because of a lack of an independent sample of confirmed cases . \n our study showed that primary diagnoses of dermatologic events recorded at hospitalization or emergency room / unplanned visit have high ppvs in the danish and swedish national patient registries . \n in contrast , the ppv for hypersensitivity leading to hospitalization or emergency room visit was substantially lower . \n thus , depending on study aims , the danish and swedish national patient registries may be useful for studying dermatologic events , but may not be adequate for studying hypersensitivity events .",

      "document": "we present a case of a cardiac transplant candidate with an ejection fraction of less than 15% who underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy . \n this is the first case in which intraoperative hemodynamic measurements were recorded in a patient with cardiopulmonary disease this severe . \n the patient underwent the procedure while measurements were made at crucial intervals ( baseline , with incremental insufflation , reverse trendelenberg , at desufflation ) using a pulmonary artery catheter , transesophageal echocardiography with fractional area measurements , radial arterial line , as well as standard monitoring . \n there was a rise in mean arterial and systemic vascular resistance with insufflation to 10 mm hg , which was further exaggerated by reverse trendelenberg . \n we conclude that if a patient with congestive heart failure is medically optimized , and intra - abdominal pressures and surgical times are minimized , laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be performed with minimal risk to the patient . \n increasingly , laparoscopic procedures are being utilized to decrease postoperative pain and length of hospital stay . \n the one group in which laparoscopy may have adverse effects , that outweigh the potential benefits , is the patient with severe cardiopulmonary disease . \n there has not been a case reported of a laparoscopic procedure with hemodynamic measurements on a patient with an ejection fraction of less than 20% . \n we present a case of a patient with end - stage cardiac disease with an ejection fraction estimated at less than 15% who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy prior to becoming eligible for cardiac transplant . \n the patient had asymptomatic cholelithiasis and was to undergo a laparoscopic vs. open cholecystectomy prior to becoming eligible for cardiac transplant . \n an echocardiogram two weeks prior to admission revealed a normal sinus rhythm , global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of less than 15% ; valvular abnormalities included mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation . \n a right and left cardiac catheterization one week prior to this admission confirmed the above , and revealed pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery pressures of 72/35 . \n pertinent medications included metropolol 6.25 mg po bid , digoxin 0.125 mg po q d , enalapril 20 mg po bid , furosemide 40 mg po q d , and coumadin 4 mg po q d. physical exam was without evidence of congestive heart failure . \n upon arrival in the operating room , the patient was connected to standard monitoring ( i.e. , 5-lead ekg , pulse oximetry , arterial blood pressure , capnography , and body temperature ) . prior to induction \n , a radial arterial line and oximetric pulmonary artery catheter were placed through the right internal jugular vein . \n induction was accomplished with etomidate 0.3 mg / kg , fentanyl 10 meg / kg , and succhinylcholine 1.0 mg / kg . \n after entubation , a hewlett - packard biplanar transesophageal echocardiography probe ( model # 21362a ) at 5.0 mhz frequency was positioned to obtain a transgastric short axis view of the midpapillary level of the left ventricle . \n anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane at 0.35 - 0.45% , nitrous oxide 50% in oxygen 50% . \n muscle relaxation was accomplished with vecuronium maintaining 1 of 4 twitches on a train - of - four . \n ventilation was controlled with the ph ranging between 7.35 - 7.40 and pco2 40 - 48 mm hg . \n blood loss was minimal , and the patient received a total of 10ml / kg of lactated ringer 's intravenously . \n measurements were taken pre - induction , immediately post - induction , five minutes after pneumoperitoneal insufflation to 5 mm hg , five minutes after insufflation to 10 mm hg , five minutes after 10 degrees of reverse trendelenburg position , and five minutes after return to the supine position and desufflation . \n parameters measured included heart rate , blood pressure , pulmonary artery pressures , cardiac output , pulmonary artery occlusion pressure , and central venous pressure . with each change in table position , \n pressure transducer height was adjusted to maintain a constant phlebostatic axis with respect to the right atrium . \n videotaped recordings of the intraoperative echocardiogram were used to evaluate for wall motion abnormalities and to calculate left ventricular fractional area change postoperatively . \n analysis was performed via manual planimetry by a skilled observer ( dck ) blinded to intraoperative events . \n end - diastolic ( eda ) and end - systolic areas ( esa ) were planimetered on two consecutive cardiac cycles and averaged using the leading edge of the left ventricular endocardial border . \n eda was determined by the greatest cross - sectional area obtained at the peak of the electrocardiogram r wave . \n percent ejection fraction area ( % efa ) was determined from the formula % efa = ( eda - esa / eda )  100 . \n laparoscopic cholecystectomy is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to open cholecystectomy . the laparoscopic procedure combines the benefit of completely removing the gallbladder with the advantages of a shorter hospital stay , less pain , and less chance of postoperative ileus compared to the open cholecystectomy . \n these advantages should provide theoretical benefits for patients with heart disease requiring cholecystectomy ; however , the use of peritoneal insufflation , co2 as the insufflating gas , and reverse trendelenburg position necessary for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been shown to cause significant alterations in hemodynamic parameters . \n some of these changes might discourage the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in high - risk cardiac patients , especially those with very low ejection fractions . \n the three variables that effect the patient 's hemodynamic parameters are insufflation , the use of co2 as the insufflant , and patient position . \n the extent of the cardiovascular changes associated with creation of pneumoperitoneum depends on the intra - abdominal pressure ( iap ) attained . with our patient , \n the iap was limited to 10 mm hg . because of her thin body habitus , this limitation was not difficult to accomplish , yet still provided adequate visualization for surgery . in healthy patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy , \n the filling pressures and mean arterial pressure ( map ) may increase , but cardiac output ( co ) typically remains unchanged . in patients with severe heart disease , however , changes in hemodynamic parameters have varied between investigators . \n utilizing iaps of 12 mm hg , have described hemodynamic changes similar to our patient . however , safran et al . , using 15 mm hg iaps , noted that several high - risk cardiac patients experienced decreases in co and svo2 . \n they felt that these patients were relatively volume depleted preinsufflation , then worsened with a further decrease in preload when insufflation was applied . \n similarly describe a significant fall in cardiac index ( ci ) and stroke volume ( sv ) despite preoperative optimization of preload and cardiac output using fluid boluses . \n neither safran nor iwase reported any intraoperative cardiac complications or any increase in postoperative morbidity or mortality . \n portera , on the other hand , reported two cases of postoperative congestive heart failure . \n he observed a progressive decrease in ci , sv , and left ventricular stroke work following desufflation in these patients ; but , he could not identify any obvious feature preoperatively , or at the time of insufflation , that might predict which patients might be at risk . the hemodynamic course of our patient was uneventful ( figure 1 ) . at 10 mm hg , our patient had changes similar to a healthy patient , documented by an increase in map and pulmonary artery wedge pressure ( pawp ) ; end diastolic volume ( estimated as end - diastolic area - eda ) and co remained unchanged . \n systemic vascular resistance ( svr ) also increased with insufflation . with our patient 's complicated preoperative course , consisting of two admissions within four weeks for chf \n , one would have expected her to be relatively volume depleted and as such respond with an increase in bp and hr . \n prior to desufflation , the most unusual finding was the decrease in echocardiographic fractional area change ( fac ) to 12% ; this finding mirrors ( and is most probably explained by ) a peak increase in svr . following desufflation , all hemodynamic parameters corrected in an appropriate fashion : increased stroke volume secondary to improved preload , decreased svr ( reduced afterload ) with subsequent increase in cardiac output , and a decrease in heart rate . pulmonary artery wedge pressure ( pawp ) , fractional area change ( fac ) by transesophageal echo . \n , systemic vascular resistance ( svr ) , mean arterial pressure ( map ) , cardiac output ( co ) , heart rate ( hr ) recorded at 5 minutes after an intra - abdominal pressure of 5 mm hg , 10 mm hg , assuming 10 degrees reverse trendelenberg ( rt ) , and on return to supine and desufflation of the abdomen . \n hypercarbia over 50 mm hg in healthy patients causes myocardial depression and is a direct vasodilator ; as a result , there is a decrease in co , svr , and ph . hypercarbia at levels less than 50 mm hg has been shown to produce minimal hemodynamic effects . in patients with ischemic heart disease , paco2 levels of 55 - 65 mm hg resulted in an increase in systolic bp , hr , and co. there was also a two to threefold increase in plasma catecholamine concentrations which suggests hypercarbia stimulates the sympathetic nervous system in this group of patients . \n we had no difficulty maintaining a paco2 below 50 mm hg in our patient ; her lean body habitus was a contributing factor in our ability to maintain adequate ventilation . \n it is unclear whether her upward trend in hr , map , and svr ( suggestive of an increase in sympathetic stimulation ) was related to the mild hypercarbia present , or to a drop in preload ( see edv , figure 1 ) . \n theoretically , the change to reverse trendelenburg should cause cardiovascular compromise in the form of decreased venous return ( vr ) and co. this decline may be offset by a decrease in afterload leading to an insignificant change in co in otherwise healthy patients . \n the study done by safran looking at laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with severe cardiac disease utilized an iap of 15 mm hg and maintained normal end - tidal co2 ( etco2 ) . \n the reverse trendelenburg position was used in most of the 15 asa physical class iii and iv patients evaluated . \n unfortunately , hemodynamic parameters were not measured after the establishment of pneumoperitoneum independently of assuming reverse trendelenburg . \n a significant increase in map and svr accompanied by a decrease in co was found . \n these changes were thought to be due to aggressive treatment of congestive heart failure preoperatively , thus leading to a volume depleted patient with little intravascular volume reserve . in our patient , the only significant finding on assuming 10 degrees of reverse trendelenburg position was an increase in the svo2 from 83% to 90% . \n this elevation in svo2 came in conjunction with a decline in etco2 from 38 mm hg to 30 mm hg , adding further credence to the improvement in pulmonary function as the probable mechanism . \n we evaluated transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) as an aid to monitoring this patient during laparoscopic cholecystectomy . following the establishment of pneumoperitoneum and assumption of the reverse trendelenburg position , the fac via tee was assessed as an indirect measure of ejection fraction ( ef ) . \n no significant changes or trends could be identified utilizing this technique , perhaps due to subtle changes in wall thickening and short axis diameters in a patient with a low ef . \n were also unable to find benefit of tee use as an intraoperative monitor in laparoscopic patients with cardiac disease . \n we conclude from this case that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely in patients with severe cardiac disease and ejection fractions less than 20% . under these circumstances it is imperative that appropriate monitoring be utilized , and iap , reverse trendelenburg and surgical time minimized .",

      "document": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Childhood Brain Tumor \nPrevention Network Act of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Tumors kill more children than any other disease and \n        brain tumors are the second most common type of cancer in \n        children.\n            (2) Childhood brain tumors are the leading cause of death \n        from solid tumors in children.\n            (3) There are newly recognized types of brain tumors, as \n        defined by the World Health Organization, and many of these \n        newly recognized types occur in children.\n            (4) The causes of the overwhelming majority of childhood \n        brain tumors are unknown.\n            (5) Brain tumors have substantial costs for affected \n        children, the families of such children, and society.\n            (6) Childhood brain tumors cause significant morbidity and \n        the loss of many years of potential life.\n            (7) The prognosis for most childhood brain tumors is dismal \n        and survivors face lasting adverse health effects.\n            (8) Because of the relatively low overall incidence of \n        childhood brain tumors, such tumors frequently do not receive \n        sufficient attention and research funding.\n            (9) No single institution has a sufficient number of \n        patients to independently conduct research that will adequately \n        address the causes of childhood brain tumors.\n            (10) There has been no comprehensive study analyzing all \n        relevant clinical, biological, and epidemiological aspects of \n        childhood brain tumors to identify potential risk factors and \n        determine the cause of such tumors.\n            (11) Existing national cooperative clinical oncology groups \n        primarily investigate treatment options and prognosis and do \n        not typically examine the origins of childhood brain tumors or \n        the risk factors associated with such tumors. A significant \n        majority of children with brain tumors are first treated by \n        neurosurgeons and not by oncologists typically involved in such \n        groups.\n\nSEC. 3.

      "document": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Dietary Supplement Full \nImplementation and Enforcement Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Each year, more than 150,000,000 Americans regularly \n        consume dietary supplements to maintain and improve their \n        health.\n            (2) Consumer expenditures on dietary supplements exceeded \n        $25,000,000,000 in 2008.\n            (3) Given the growing awareness of the importance of \n        prevention and wellness in the health care system of the United \n        States, it is vital that laws governing the safety of, and \n        education about, dietary supplements be fully implemented and \n        enforced.\n            (4) In 1994, Congress approved, and the President signed \n        into law, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of \n        1994 (Public Law 103-417) (referred to in this Act as \n        ``DSHEA''). DSHEA balanced the importance of continuing \n        consumer access to vitamins, minerals, and other dietary \n        supplements, promoting scientific research on the benefits and \n        risks of dietary supplements, and fostering public education on \n        the benefits and risks of supplement use with the need for \n        regulatory safeguards to protect consumer health, including a \n        new standard for safety, penalties for mislabeled or \n        adulterated dietary supplements, rules to ensure scientific \n        substantiation of the claims made regarding dietary \n        supplements, and a notification requirement to the Food and \n        Drug Administration before dietary supplements that contain \n        certain new dietary ingredients may be marketed.\n            (5) DSHEA requires that claims made on dietary supplement \n        labels, packaging, and accompanying material be truthful, non-\n        misleading, and substantiated. Manufacturers are prohibited \n        from making claims that products are intended to diagnose, \n        treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a disease.\n            (6) DSHEA requires that dietary supplements comply with \n        good manufacturing practice (referred to in this section as \n        ``GMP'') requirements, and authorizes the Food and Drug \n        Administration to establish such requirements.\n            (7) In 2007, after many years of delay, the Food and Drug \n        Administration published regulations detailing the GMP \n        requirements for dietary supplements, including requirements \n        for identity, purity, strength, sanitary conditions, and \n        recordkeeping. The Food and Drug Administration began to \n        enforce those requirements in 2008.\n            (8) DSHEA requires that, before marketing a dietary \n        supplement containing certain new dietary ingredients, the \n        manufacturer or distributor must submit notice to the Food and \n        Drug Administration that includes information showing that the \n        dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe. \n        According to the Food and Drug Administration, the Food and \n        Drug Administration has raised objections to more than 70 \n        percent of all new dietary ingredient notifications submitted \n        to the agency.\n            (9) The Food and Drug Administration has successfully used \n        the adulteration provisions of DSHEA to remove from the \n        marketplace dietary supplements that present an unreasonable \n        risk of injury or illness.\n            (10) In 2002, Congress passed the Public Health Security \n        and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act (Public Law 107-\n        188). This law requires any facility engaged in manufacturing, \n        processing, packing, or holding food for consumption in the \n        United States, including dietary supplements, to be registered \n        with the Food and Drug Administration.\n            (11) In 2006, Congress supplemented DSHEA by approving the \n        Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection \n        Act (Public Law 109-462). This law requires dietary supplement \n        manufacturers, packers, and distributors to report promptly to \n        the Food and Drug Administration any reports the manufacturer \n        or other responsible person receives of serious adverse events \n        associated with the use of the products of such manufacturer or \n        other responsible person. Information the Food and Drug \n        Administration receives under this reporting requirement may \n        help the agency detect possible safety problems related to \n        dietary supplement products or ingredients.\n            (12) DSHEA created the Office of Dietary Supplements within \n        the National Institutes of Health to expand research and \n        consumer information about the health effects of dietary \n        supplements. The Office of Dietary Supplements has greatly \n        expanded the number of scientific studies of dietary \n        supplements and the availability of reliable information to \n        consumers.\n            (13) While the Food and Drug Administration has taken some \n        important steps to implement and enforce DSHEA and the other \n        laws governing the regulation of dietary supplements, the \n        agency has not fully implemented and enforced DSHEA and the \n        other laws governing the regulation of dietary supplements.\n            (14) Both the public and regulated industry would benefit \n        from more guidance from the Food and Drug Administration on the \n        procedures and definitions concerning the regulation of new \n        dietary ingredients under section 413 of the Federal Food, \n        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350b).\n            (15) If the Food and Drug Administration determines that a \n        product labeled as a dietary supplement includes an anabolic \n        steroid or an analogue of an anabolic steroid, the Food and \n        Drug Administration does not systematically notify the Drug \n        Enforcement Administration of that determination.\n            (16) The Food and Drug Administration needs adequate \n        resources to implement and enforce DSHEA and other laws \n        governing the regulation of dietary supplements appropriately. \n        Congress has appropriated additional funds over the last \n        several years to implement and enforce DSHEA, reaching more \n        than $14,000,000 for fiscal year 2009.\n            (17) According to the Food and Drug Administration, full \n        implementation of DSHEA and the other laws governing the \n        regulation of dietary supplements would require substantial \n        additional resources. In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration \n        reported to Congress in writing that the agency would need \n        between $24,000,000 and $65,000,000 per year to fully implement \n        DSHEA.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that:\n            (1) The Food and Drug Administration should increase \n        efforts to implement DSHEA more fully and effectively, by--\n                    (A) providing Congress with a professional judgment \n                estimate of the annual costs during the 5-year period \n                beginning on the date of enactment of this Act to fully \n                implement and enforce DSHEA and other dietary \n                supplement laws and regulations under the jurisdiction \n                of the Food and Drug Administration;\n                    (B) conducting inspections, using appropriately \n                trained inspection personnel, of all facilities in \n                which a dietary supplement is manufactured, processed, \n                packed, or held to ensure compliance with the new \n                dietary supplement good manufacturing practices \n                regulations;\n                    (C) using the authority under DSHEA to protect the \n                public from unsafe dietary supplement products and \n                ingredients and to ensure that claims made are \n                truthful, non-misleading, and substantiated, with \n                highest regulatory priority given to cases of clear \n                violations of the law (including the intentional \n                adulteration and spiking of products);\n                    (D) implementing the recommendations contained in \n                the January 2009 report of the Government \n                Accountability Office, entitled, ``Dietary Supplements: \n                FDA Should Take Further Actions To Improve Oversight \n                and Consumer Understanding'', (GAO 09-250) that the \n                Food and Drug Administration--\n                            (i) require all dietary supplement \n                        manufacturers, packers, and distributors to \n                        identify themselves specifically as such under \n                        existing registration requirements and to \n                        update such information annually;\n                            (ii) promptly issue guidance to clarify \n                        when a dietary supplement ingredient is a new \n                        dietary ingredient, the evidence needed to \n                        document the safety of new dietary ingredients, \n                        and appropriate methods for establishing the \n                        identity of a new dietary ingredient; and\n                            (iii) coordinate with stakeholder groups \n                        involved in consumer outreach to identify, \n                        implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of \n                        additional mechanisms for educating consumers \n                        about the safety, efficacy, and labeling of \n                        dietary supplements; and\n                    (E) notifying the Drug Enforcement Administration \n                if the Food and Drug Administration determines that the \n                information in a new dietary ingredient notification \n                submitted under section 413 of the Federal Food, Drug, \n                and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350b) is inadequate to \n                establish that the new dietary ingredient will \n                reasonably be expected to be safe, because the dietary \n                supplement may contain an anabolic steroid or an \n                analogue of an anabolic steroid.\n            (2) The manufacturers, packers, retailers, and distributors \n        of dietary supplements and dietary supplement ingredients \n        should increase efforts to--\n                    (A) comply fully with all requirements of DSHEA and \n                the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug \n                Consumer Protection Act;\n                    (B) cooperate fully and appropriately with the Food \n                and Drug Administration in implementation and \n                enforcement of Federal laws and regulations; and\n                    (C) provide the Food and Drug Administration with \n                appropriate input on known and suspected violations of \n                such laws and regulations.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Several recent failures have drawn negative attention \n        to the protective mission of the United States Secret Service. \n        Such key failures include lapses in responding appropriately to \n        potential threats to the White House complex, United States \n        Secret Service personnel exhibiting conduct that is unbecoming \n        to the Service in several instances, and reports of United \n        States Secret Service personnel misusing the authorities and \n        resources of the Service.\n            (2) For example, on September 19, 2014, an individual \n        obtained unauthorized access to the White House. Such access \n        was obtained after failures in five security layers by the \n        United States Secret Service. In another example, on November \n        11, 2011, an individual fired multiple shots from a \n        semiautomatic rifle at the White House complex. It was revealed \n        that a total of seven bullets struck the exterior of the \n        building. The Service failed to fully investigate the incident \n        in a timely manner or to disclose it.\n            (3) On March 23, 2014, a Special Agent assigned to the \n        Counter Assault Team was found intoxicated to the point of \n        unconsciousness in a hotel in Amsterdam in advance of a \n        Presidential visit. In another example, on April 11, 2012, \n        conduct unbecoming to United States Secret Service personnel \n        was exhibited before a Presidential visit to Cartagena, \n        Columbia. Nine personnel were involved in serious misconduct.\n            (4) Surveillance personnel from the Washington field office \n        were diverted in 2011 from supporting the protective mission at \n        the request of senior leadership in order to provide protection \n        to a United States Secret Service employee at her home \n        following a neighborhood dispute. Such a diversion was outside \n        the scope of the Service's duties and violated the Standards of \n        Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch.\n    (b) Further Findings.--Congress further finds that the protection \nof the President, Vice President, First and Second Families, and former \nPresidents is a matter of national security. Any issues that distract \nfrom the protective mission of the United States Secret Service are a \nthreat to the national security of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established in the legislative branch an independent \nadvisory panel to--\n            (1) examine the efficiency and effectiveness of the \n        leadership structure, protocols, training, tools, and \n        capabilities of the Department of Homeland Security's mission \n        to protect national leaders, visiting heads of state and \n        government, designated sites, and special events of national \n        significance (in accordance with paragraph (1) of section \n        3056(e) of title 18 United States Code); and\n            (2) make recommendations to improve the overall efficiency \n        and effectiveness of the United States Secret Service.\n\nSEC. 4.

DUTIES.\n\n    The Panel shall assess the current leadership structure, protocols, \ntraining, tools, and capabilities of the United States Secret Service, \nincluding assessing--\n            (1) the unity of effort between the divisions of the United \n        States Secret Service, law enforcement agencies, and other \n        components of the Department of Homeland Security related to \n        the protective and investigative missions, including whether \n        mission duplication with other Federal entities exists;\n            (2) the impact of United States Secret Service personnel \n        culture on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Service, \n        including Special Agent and Uniformed Division retention;\n            (3) the impact any leadership or security deficiencies have \n        on the threat from acts of terrorism or other security \n        incidents;\n            (4) identification of all security breaches at locations \n        under United States Secret Service protection in the past five \n        years;\n            (5) the extent to which current resources provide for \n        accomplishing the mission of the United States Secret Service;\n            (6) the effectiveness of communications and dissemination \n        of homeland security information within the United States \n        Secret Service and with other law enforcement entities in \n        routine as well as emergency situations; and\n            (7) any necessary recommendations for congressional \n        consideration.\n\nSEC. 6.

control studies were associated with the presence or absence of a disease ( q4 ) as compared to the msc group ( 62.3% ) and the bds group ( 18.8% ) . \n when the data were analyzed according to the gender there was no statistical difference seen . \n third variable ( objectives and common designs ) : descriptive frequencies were lower for the bds group ( 23.75% ) , but the msc and ph.d . \n likewise [ table 2c ] , all the respondents showed poor knowledge of the objectives and the common designs , the difference being highly significant for all the questions when the data were analyzed according to the academic qualifications ( p < 0.005 ) . when the answers were analyzed according to the different genders , nearly a statistical significance ( 0.061 ) was seen with respect to the first question . \n table 3 shows a significant association of knowledge with gender and qualification ( bds , msc and phd ) . \n the total mean of knowledge ( 10.77  1.70 ) with significant association with gender and academic degree . \n knowledge scores of the respondents by qualification and gender the bds group showed the least knowledge scores when compared to the msc and ph.d . \n male respondents showed better knowledge scores ( 11.20 ) when compared to the females ( 10.20 ) with a significance value ( p < 0.005 ) . \n our study intended to gauge the opinion and response of the health professionals associated with academics to their research experience , design , and the objection and commonly used designs in the field of research . \n the data obtained from the respondents was less than satisfactory , as out of 300 questionnaires sent to the academicians via personal contacts and mail , only 95 questionnaires were complete and the participation was found to be only 31.66% in our study , we found that males responded earlier as compared to the females . according to our first variable table 2a \n , the response was found to be similar among all the health professionals irrespective of whether they belonged to the bds / msc or / ph.d . \n the second variable [ table 2b ] was the response rate , wherein the bds group gave a very poor response , and the msc group showed a better response when compared to the ph.d . groups . \n when the data for the third variable [ table 2c ] was collated , the bds group showed a poor response once again , but the response of the msc and the ph.d . \n we found that our study was similar to the studies done by adeyemi et al . and mcsherry et al . \n surveyed the opinion of resident doctors in nigeria on the use of qualitative research design and methods in dentistry . \n all 20 dental residents were familiar with qualitative research design , 50% residents categorized qualitative research design as social science , 25% residents said it was just a science and 25% residents were not sure of the qualitative research technique . \n adeyemi et al . admitted that the qualitative approach to research in dentistry may be useful to understand meanings which patients attach to actions , decisions , beliefs and values concerning their care . \n mcsherry et al . conducted a descriptive quantitative study about research awareness in evidence based practice . \n out of his convenience sample of 2126 registered health care practitioners ( rhcps ) , 843 rhcps responded to the questionnaires . \n seven hundred and thirty - three ( 91% ) rhcps agreed that evidence - based practice played a large role in improving patient care . \n this point was reinforced when 701 ( 86% ) of respondents strongly agreed that evidence - based practice was the way forward to change clinical practice . \n the author concluded that irrespective of position or grade , the rhcps had a positive attitude towards research but faced many obstacles . \n the key obstacles listed were a lack of time , support , knowledge and confidence . during our research \n , we received 35 partially filled questionnaires from health professionals thus showing a lack of interest to respond . \n the knowledge scores of the bds group when compared to the msc and the phd groups showed a high statistical significance . \n the knowledge scores for the msc group compared to the phd group showed no statistical significance [ table 3 ] . \n the msc graduates are well aware of the recent advances in research methodologies . in a few countries , \n a mini thesis is included in the msc 2 year program while in a few others a complete dissertation is included in the master of dental surgery ( mds ) 3-year program which is equivalent to a phd thesis . in this study , we expected the third variable to be more pronounced among the phd graduates , but it was similar to the msc graduates . \n the third variable showed statistical significance when the data were analyzed on the basis of qualification [ table 2c ] . \n this was evident for the qualification as the third variable had difference among the opinion for the questions . \n the same was evident in our study as we found a high statistical significance with bds group compared to the msc and the ph.d . groups . \n the health professionals must involve themselves into evidence - based learning and supported each other by their research experience and knowledge , then a coordinated approach would enable them to gain confidence in academics or clinical practice . in our study , we found men ( 18.3% ) responded earlier than women ( 13.3% ) . \n this was in agreement with the study done by mcfarlane et al . , where among 1592 of his respondents with physician demographic characteristics , 80% were male , and 20% were females . \n the knowledge scores [ table 3 ] for the males as compared to the females was slightly higher and was statistically significant . \n this might be due to the lesser no of female academicians in the university as compared to men . \n the probable cause may be due to the academicians associated with the universities having varied work schedules and being preoccupied with pending questionnaire studies to answer . \n a few professionals like the phds are hard to reach and are redirected to their receptionists or assistants . \n , where he addressed the receptionists as gatekeepers because most of the questionnaires would be retained by them and hence would remain unanswered \n . cummings et al . revealed in 2001 that the response rate among the health professionals would be 10% lower than the studies conducted with the general population . in our study , we too observed a lack of response from the health professionals . according to leece et al . , 2004 \n , he concluded , that in surveys conducted via internet or mail service , a greater nonresponse bias may be seen in comparison with other methods like personal contact via questionnaire , interviews or repeated telephonic surveys . according to mcmohan \n 2003 , he concluded that the response accuracy in his study was low , as he found a few incomplete answers compared to the answers in the same questionnaires sent by fax or postal services . \n this was in conjunction with our study , as we also obtained a less than satisfactory response , as we also chose the web services via the internet e - mail service to distribute our questionnaire . \n ( 2000 ) , suggested that the nonresponse bias can be overcome by advertising the authors with prepaid incentives , personalized letters and professional organization sponsorship could show an increased response rate as compared to sending repeated questionnaire via mail services . in this study , irrespective of the sample size , we were keen to collect the data from these learned individuals and to gauge their opinion . \n the questionnaire was very simple and contained very straight forward questions , thus reducing the bias with the questionnaire . \n thus , we could label our research as a feasibility study , as we conducted our study by using very simple and flexible methodology . on the other hand \n , a pilot study uses a more rigid methodology such as sample estimation , randomization , case and control group selection and statistical analysis . \n moreover , almost all pilot studies would report their results inaccurate and may demand to conduct further larger studies . \n the objective of our survey was to ascertain the opinion of health professionals and also their response and enthusiasm regarding this study . \n our study seemed to be a qualitative research , as it showed us the actual response rather than what was expected . \n thus , this kind of research is totally dependent on the participants to investigate any scientific or social cause . \n most authors can interpret multiple opinions with qualitative research , but most of their experiences regarding qualitative research are strong and encouraging . \n leedy and ormrod ( 2001 ) stated that qualitative research is less structured in the description , as it helps in the formation and builds up new theories via subjective responses from the participants . unlike qualitative research , quantitative research builds on deductive reasoning . \n although started in ancient times around 1250 ad , quantitative research was used for surveys and experimental studies with existing theories . \n quantitative research is always independent of the researcher , as it creates the results through objectivity uncovered in the collected data . \n we believe that this study is limited due to the low response rate , and it has been conducted at the single academic institute . \n we envisage this study could be utilized for a broader research study that would include several academic institutes in saudi arabia and gulf region to reflect the views of academic staff on this important notion . \n this survey was done to judge or elicit the response of health professionals associated with academics . \n the analyzed data presented a high statistical significance when the bds group was compared with the mds and ph.d . \n it is always believed that knowledge is the most powerful tool and knowledge from research must be applied to clinical practice , thus helping us to guide the students in a better way . \n the art of literature criticism is a skill that can be learned , and the practice of this art will contribute to the knowledge of the literature . \n  \n ",

      "document": "temporary external ventricular drainage for refractory thoracolumbar cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) leak is not reported in the literature . \n we present a young man who had multiple complex spinal surgeries for resection of innumerable metastatic ependymoma lesions . \n as a last resort , we decided to place an external ventricular catheter for proximal controlled csf drainage with great success . \n the 32-year - old man had a history of spinal myxopapillary ependymoma world health organization ( who ) grade i with local metastatic spinal disease . the patient first presented in 2005 with a 1-year history of severe low back pain . he was found to have an intradural lesion , and subsequently had a t12l3 laminectomy for resection of the tumor . \n small amounts of the tumor adherent to the nerve roots were purposefully left behind . each time an attempt was made to remove these residual small pieces of the tumor , significant amounts of neuromonitoring activity was noted . \n hence , the residual tumor was left behind so as to not cause a neurologic deficit . \n approximately 10 days after surgery , the patient fell at home and noticed significant amounts of a clear fluid consistent with csf leaking from his incision . \n he was taken to the operating room at that time and a dural defect was identified and closed primarily , then covered with gelfoam ( baxter healthcare , deerfield , il , united states ) and tisseel ( baxter healthcare ) . the patient again noted another csf leak from a different area of his incision 5 days later , and he was taken back to the operating room for another primary closure , as well as placement of a fat graft and more tisseel . \n adjuvant radiation treatment was undertaken after he recovered from the initial surgeries . in 2008 , \n he was found to have a dorsally located intradural lesion at the t8t9 region , which was resected via a t7t10 laminectomy . in 2010 , \n he was found to have growing intradural lesions at l4 and l5 . at that time \n one year later , our patient presented yet again with multiple thoracolumbar intradural lesions ( fig . \n he underwent redo decompressive laminectomies from t8s1 with a total of 13 intradural tumors being excised ( fig . \n 2 ) . the dural closure proved to be quite complex , as there were several areas that were macerated and very difficult to reapproximate . \n fat grafts , duraform ( depuy synthes , west chester , pa , united states ) , and tisseel were all used on top of the attempted primary dural closure . \n preoperative sagittal t2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) ( a ) of the thoracic spine revealing multiple intradural tumors as well as an axial t2-weighted mri ( b ) revealing significant compression of the spinal cord . \n postoperative t2-weighted sagittal ( a ) and axial ( b ) magnetic resonance imaging revealing gross total resection of multiple intradural tumors . \n radiographic evidence of a refractory thoracolumbar cerebrospinal fluid leak was not readily evident on the immediate postoperative films . during his hospital course , the patient developed a spontaneous csf leak from his wound . \n it was initially treated by oversewing the skin , but the leak persisted over the next day . \n we decided to bring the patient back to the operating room for an exploration and an attempt at repairing the dural defects . \n multiple dural defects were noted . as a result of the significant dural maceration , another primary closure was not attempted . \n we placed more pieces of duraform , fat graft , and tisseel over the areas of csf leakage , and we again performed a tight multilayer closure of the muscle , fascia , fat , and subcutaneous tissue . despite our best efforts to stop the csf leak , the leak continued through the incisions from multiple areas . \n as a last resort , we decided to place a right frontal external ventricular drain ( evd ; integra life sciences , plainsboro , nj , united states ) after obtaining a preprocedure computed tomography scan of the head , to ensure the ventricular size could accommodate the catheter ( fig . \n he was placed on antibiotics for both the pneumonia as well as the csf leak and subsequent meningitis . on the day 8 of the evd in place \n , we continued to see cessation of the csf leak and decided to perform a 3-day clamping trial . \n no further csf leak was noted from the incision during the clamping trial . the evd was removed , and the patient was eventually discharged home without further complications . \n preprocedure computed tomography scan of the head to ensure the ventricular size could accommodate an external ventricular drain ( a ) . \n postprocedure scan showing successful placement of a right frontal external ventricular drain ( b ) . \n a watertight dural closure is essential in reducing the risk of csf leakage in spinal surgery . \n eismont et al recommended the meticulous closure of the dura at the time of surgery and reoperation and repair of dural tears upon the discovery of a persistent csf leak.1 conservative management may be initially attempted with bed rest for 3 days with subsequent slow advancement to ambulation . \n eighty - six of eighty - eight patients with dural tears studied by wang et al had resolution of csf leaks with primary dural closure at the time of surgery followed by bed rest.2 others have confirmed the efficacy of treating such leaks via csf diversion in the lumbar region.3 \n  a review of the literature revealed scarce reports of csf leakage in more complex patients such as the patient in this case . \n this complexity arose from the multiple surgeries that were performed due to the recurrence of this intradural disease . \n they are benign , slow - growing , who grade i tumors that are amenable to surgical resection with optimal outcomes when gross total resection is achieved . \n although pathologically they may be  low grade ,  they can be metastatic locally within the spine via the csf route . \n recurrence of the disease is usually in the same region and is substantiated by subtotal or piecemeal resection.4 \n  spine surgeons occasionally encounter lumbar csf leak . \n routine iatrogenic csf leaks can usually be repaired primarily by suturing the dural defect , with the subsequent placement of a liquefied dural sealant such as tisseel . \n our patient 's dura was manipulated on multiple occasions over the span of half a decade . with each surgery to remove more metastatic lesions , the dura became more macerated . \n this damaged dura created multiple avenues for csf to leak , which was essentially refractory to all of our attempts at a repair . a case report by yeager demonstrated the use of an evd with subsequent conversion to a shunt for a persistent cervical csf leak after a schwannoma resection.5 however , \n temporary external ventricular drainage for refractory lumbar spinal fluid leaks is not reported in the literature . \n lumbar drains have been utilized in the case of persistent cervical csf leaks.6 we feel that a lumbar drain in our particular case would not have been best suited for the patient we presented . \n we placed an evd in this situation as opposed to a lumbar drain because maximal csf diversion from the macerated dura would take place with a proximal avenue for controlled csf drainage , which would essentially decrease the pressure gradient of csf in an attempt to traverse the dural defects more distally . \n although the placement of external ventricular drains comes with associated risks , if they are placed safely after a preprocedure computed tomography scan is done , their usage can be a viable option for temporary proximal csf diversion for refractory thoracolumbar csf leaks .",

      "document": "moderate to severe gastroesophageal reflux in neonates and infants is often a complex interaction of developmental and anatomic conditions that limits adequate enteral intake and may be associated with significant morbidity . \n common comorbidities in infants with gastroesophageal reflux include failure to thrive , prematurity , neurological impairment , and chronic respiratory conditions , all of which can be exacerbated by anatomic anomalies that further predispose to the development or progression of gastroesophageal reflux . \n although a laparotomy will often correct a congenital or acquired anatomic anomaly , the surgical adhesions that form as a result of a laparotomy may complicate subsequent surgical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux . \n many studies document the safety and long - term efficacy of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants and children . \n the laparoscopic approach is feasible as a primary procedure and a secondary procedure after failure of a previous open or laparoscopic reflux operation . \n however , few studies have examined the efficacy of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in infants and children after previous laparotomy for diseases or problems unrelated to reflux . \n the purpose of this study is to examine our experience with open and laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in a population of infants with a history of previous neonatal laparotomy for diseases unrelated to gastroesophageal reflux . \n an institutional review board - approved retrospective review ( irb # 05091500 ) of our surgical procedure database at the children 's hospital of pittsburgh was conducted to identify all infants with a history of neonatal laparotomy who subsequently required surgical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux . \n study dates were january 1 , 2000 through september 1 , 2005 . during the period reviewed , \n 32 infants were identified with a history of neonatal laparotomy and subsequent surgical correction of gastroesophageal reflux . \n only infants requiring surgical correction of reflux within the first year of life , and therefore less than 12 months after neonatal laparotomy , were included in this study . \n this 12-month time frame was selected because we specifically chose to evaluate infants , and it represented a more homogeneous subset of patients when comparing laparoscopic nissen fundoplication ( lnf ) and open nissen fundoplication ( onf ) groups . \n the 6 excluded patients were all older than 12 months at the time of nissen fundoplication ( 3 in each group , age range 2 to 15 years old ) . \n these 26 infants underwent laparotomy during the neonatal period for multiple different diagnoses including intestinal atresia ( duodenal , jejunal and ileal ) ; necrotizing enterocolitis ; meconium ileus ; gastroschisis ; omphalocele ; malrotation ; congenital diaphragmatic hernia and imperforate anus . \n twelve infants underwent lnf and 14 infants underwent onf , thereby forming the 2 study groups . \n gastroesophageal reflux was identified clinically , radiographically , or with both methods , and the infants underwent surgical correction of the reflux at the discretion of the attending surgeon . \n all infants had either a barium esophagram or a nuclear gastric emptying scan , which documented gastroesophageal reflux before anti - reflux surgery . \n a nissen fundoplication was performed in all cases either open or laparoscopically by dividing the short - gastric vessels and creating a 360-degree wrap of the fundus around the esophagus . \n ten of 12 infants in the lnf group had concomitant feeding gastrostomy tubes placed laparoscopically . \n two infants in the lnf group already had gastrostomy tubes in place at the time of fundoplication , both of which were placed by the open method , one on the first day ( duodenal atresia ) and the other at one month of age ( jejunal atresia ) . \n in the first infant , the tube was taken down laparoscopically at the time of fundoplication and replaced in a new position on the gastric wall to accomplish the wrap . in the second infant , \n thirteen of 14 infants in the onf group had a feeding gastrostomy tube placed at the time of fundoplication with 3 of these infants having relocation of an existing gastrostomy tube . \n outcome variables included age at initial laparotomy , number of previous laparotomies before surgical correction of the gastroesophageal reflux , age at the time of fundoplication , weight at the time of fundoplication , operative time for fundoplication , length of stay , and time to resumption of enteral feeds after fundoplication , recurrence of gastroesophageal re - flux , and mean follow - up duration . in general , \n infants with these neonatal diagnoses , with or without antireflux surgery , are followed for a minimum of 5 years by our group . \n of the 26 infants identified with a history of neonatal laparotomy and subsequent surgical correction of gastroesophageal reflux within 12 months of life , 12 infants underwent laparoscopic nissen fundoplication ( lnf ) , and 14 infants underwent open nissen fundoplication ( onf ) . in the lnf group , diagnoses included 4 neonates with gastroschisis , 3 neonates with intestinal atresia ( 1 duodenal , 1 ileal , 1 jejunal ) , 2 neonates with meconium ileus ( both underwent ileostomy and mucus fistula at day of life # 1 with re - anastomosis at 2 to 3 months of age ) , and 1 each with omphalocele , malrotation , and perforated necrotizing enterocolitis . in the onf group , diagnoses included 4 neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( all left - sided , repaired by laparotomy ) , 4 neonates with gastroschisis , 2 neonates with perforated necrotizing enterocolitis , 2 neonates with imperforate anus / tracheoesophageal fistula , 1 infant with omphalocele , and 1 infant with intestinal atresia . in the lnf group , 4 infants had intestinal stomas performed at initial operation with subsequent closure before fundoplication . in the onf group , 3 infants had stomas created at initial laparotomy and subsequent takedown before fundoplication . \n there was no difference between the 2 groups relative to age at the time of initial laparotomy ( 1 day of life for lnf vs 14 days of life for onf , p=0.08 ) . \n what may appear as a large difference in days of life at initial operation may be accounted for by the fact that 2 patients in the onf group had initial laparotomies at ages 51 days ( ileostomy/ mucus fistula for perforated nec in ex-25 week gestation infant ) and 90 days ( duodenoduodenostomy for duodenal atresia in 1.5-kg infant born at 800 g ) . \n there was no difference in age at the time of the fundoplication ( 5.5 months for lnf vs 6.6 months for onf , p=0.57 ) , nor was there any difference between the 2 groups with respect to infants ' weight at the time of the fundoplication ( 5.2 kg lnf vs 5.7 kg onf , p=0.51 ) . \n the number of previous laparotomies prior to fundoplication was similar in each group ( 1.7 laparotomies for lnf vs 1.9 laparotomies for onf , p=0.36 ) . \n additionally , operative time was comparable between the groups with an average operative time of 131 minutes in the lnf group ( range , 77 to 190 ) and 164 minutes in the onf group ( range , 100 to 287 ) ( p=0.10 ) . \n infants undergoing lnf did resume enteral feeds earlier than those undergoing onf ( 3.0 days lnf vs 6.3 days onf , p=0.01 ) . \n the length of stay after fundoplication was actually shorter in the lnf group ( 14 days lnf vs 26 days onf , p=0.13 ) , but this did not reach statistical significance . \n all infants in both groups progressed to tolerate full oral , gastrostomy , or both , feeds with appropriate weight gain during follow - up periods . \n subjectively , no infants in either group developed recurrent gastroesophageal reflux or wrap failure during an average follow - up period of 22 months ( range , 1 to 54 ) . \n follow - up length of time for the lnf group was not different from that in the onf group ( 1 to 28 months versus 1 to 54 months , respectively , p = ns ) . \n however , routine monitoring for recurrent reflux is not done at our institution unless an infant develops feeding intolerance after fundoplication . \n our results suggest that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication ( lnf ) is at least as safe and effective as open nissen fundoplication ( onf ) in the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in a population of infants with a history of a neonatal laparotomy . \n additionally , lnf appears to have a distinct advantage by allowing an early resumption of full enteral feeds after nissen fundoplication . \n all of the infants in this study required an operation in the neonatal period for surgical diseases unrelated to gastroesophageal reflux . \n both the onf and the lnf groups included infants with a variety of neonatal surgical diseases , many of which predispose to the subsequent development of gastroesophageal reflux . \n specifically , there is a well - documented increase in the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in neonates with a history of gastroschisis , congenital diaphragmatic hernia , and omphalocele . \n the risk for the development of gastroesophageal reflux in these infants is theorized to be secondary to defects of bowel motility , increased abdominal pressure , and gastroesophageal junction anatomical anomalies . \n at least half of the infants in both the onf and lnf groups had a variety of abdominal wall and diaphragmatic defects . \n there have been few studies in infants and children that address the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal re - flux in children with previous abdominal surgery . \n best studied is the role of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication for recurrent gastroesophageal reflux after either an open or laparoscopic primary fundoplication . \n rothenbergs has one of the largest series of laparoscopic redo nissen fundoplications with 118 patients ages 6 months to 19 years . in this study , redo laparoscopic nissen fundoplication was safe and efficacious in these infants , children , and adolescents . \n other authors have also documented the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic redo nissen fundoplications in infants and children of a variety of ages . \n however , fewer studies have examined the role of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication after neonatal laparotomy for diseases unrelated to gastroesophageal reflux . in a study by liu et al \n , the authors concluded that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication was feasible and safe in a population of children with previous ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement , gastrostomy placement , or both . \n similarly , lintula et al15 concluded that a pre - existing gastrostomy tube did not preclude a safe and effective laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in children . \n van der zee et al both documented the technical feasibility and safety of nissen fundoplication in children with a pre - existing gastrostomy tube . \n although these studies do examine redo laparoscopic surgery , none of these studies have examined the role of a laparotomy for primary neonatal surgical disease pre - existing the development of gastroesophageal reflux . \n there are distinct nuances in achieving safe minimally invasive access in infants after neonatal laparotomy . for infants with abdominal wall defects \n ( eg , gastroschisis and omphalocele ) , the umbilicus is avoided because the majority of these infants have dense adhesions in this area from prior repair . in our study , initial access for these patients was achieved through a left upper quadrant cut down approach with a 4-mm port . in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and intestinal atresia , adhesions from a prior laparotomy \n thus , access via the umbilicus was attempted and successful for these patients . for some patients , \n extended operative times were due to optimizing port placement and extensive adhesiolysis to complete a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication . \n unfortunately , the actual times for this aspect of the study operations were not recorded separately , and therefore , we are unable to determine the exact time for doing the fundoplication portion of the operation . beyond the technical feasibility of a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication at any time point after a neonatal laparotomy \n , our study also highlights the feasibility of a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in a group of very small infants . \n specifically , all of the infants in the lnf group underwent fundoplication at an average weight of 5.2 kg ( range , 2.7 to 8.8 ) . \n these infants were , on average , smaller than the infants and children in the largest series of redo laparoscopic nissen fundoplication , in which the lowest documented weight was 6.4 kg . \n however , we are not aware of any studies that have examined weight as a selection criterion for redo laparoscopic nissen fundoplication . \n the study dates include a period of transition in our institution with respect to surgical approaches to gastroesophageal reflux . in 2001 , \n an experienced laparoscopic surgeon joined the surgical group , resulting in a gradual conversion over to advanced laparoscopic approaches to historically open surgical diseases . \n the number as well as the approach for surgical anti - reflux operations at our institution increased and changed over the time period of this study from 41 in 2000 ( 37 onf ; 4 lnf ) to 122 in 2005 ( 118 lnf ; 4 onf ) . \n as advanced laparoscopic skills have developed in the group , the operative times for primary lnf have ranged from 45 minutes to 135 minutes , depending on staff and resident trainee experience . \n more surgeons will now consider primary laparoscopic nissen fundoplication , even in the face of previous abdominal surgery . \n we intend to review our experience for all anti - reflux operations in the neonatal age group or in infants under 7 kg to determine the outcomes and benefits of such an approach in this patient population . \n currently , a primary laparoscopic approach is our preferred approach to gastroesophageal reflux , regardless of the history of previous operations . \n outcomes following laparoscopic or open nissen fundoplication performed in infants after a neonatal laparotomy are similar . \n however , a laparoscopic fundoplication did allow for earlier return to enteral feeds compared with the open approach and tends toward shorter hospital length of stay . \n therefore , we conclude that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is technically feasible , safe , and effective in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants with a previous neonatal laparotomy .",

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Cape Fox Corporation (referred to in this Act as \n        ``Cape Fox'') is a Village Corporation for the Native Village \n        of Saxman, Alaska, organized pursuant to the Alaska Native \n        Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);\n            (2) similar to other Village Corporations in southeast \n        Alaska, under section 16 of that Act (43 U.S.C. 1615), Cape Fox \n        could select only 23,040 acres from land withdrawn for the \n        purpose of that selection;\n            (3) under section 22(l) of that Act (43 U.S.C. 1621(l))--\n                    (A) the Village Corporations in southeast Alaska, \n                other than Cape Fox, were restricted with respect to \n                the selection of land within 2 miles of a home rule \n                city (as that term is used in that Act); and\n                    (B) to protect the watersheds in the vicinity, Cape \n                Fox was restricted with respect to the selection of \n                land within 6 miles of the boundary of the home rule \n                city of Ketchikan, Alaska;\n            (4) the 6-mile restriction described in paragraph (3)(B) \n        precluded Cape Fox from selecting valuable timber land, \n        industrial sites, and other commercial property located--\n                    (A) within the townships in which the Native \n                Village of Saxman is located, more particularly \n                described as T.75 S., T.76 S., R.91 E., Copper River \n                Meridian; and\n                    (B) on surrounding land that is far removed from \n                Ketchikan, Alaska, and its watersheds;\n            (5) as a result of that 6-mile restriction, only the \n        remote, mountainous, northeast corner of the property described \n        in paragraph (4)(A), which is nonproductive and has no known \n        economic value, was available for selection by Cape Fox, as \n        required under section 16(b) of the Alaska Native Claims \n        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1615(b));\n            (6) land selections by Cape Fox under that Act were further \n        limited by the fact that--\n                    (A) the Annette Island Indian Reservation is \n                located within the applicable selection area; and\n                    (B) land of that reservation is unavailable for \n                selection by Cape Fox;\n            (7) Cape Fox is the only Village Corporation affected by \n        the restrictions described in paragraphs (3)(B) and (6);\n            (8) the Secretary of the Interior (referred to in this Act \n        as the ``Secretary'') has advised Congress that the predicament \n        of Cape Fox is sufficiently unique to warrant the legislative \n        remedy provided by this Act; and\n            (9) the adjustment of the selections available and \n        conveyances of land to Cape Fox under the Alaska Native Claims \n        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and the related \n        adjustment of selections available and conveyances of land to \n        the Regional Corporation for Sealaska established pursuant to \n        that Act, are in accordance with--\n                    (A) the purposes of that Act; and\n                    (B) the public interest.\n\nSEC. 2. WAIVER OF CORE TOWNSHIP REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN LAND.\n\n    Notwithstanding section 16(b) of the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1615(b)), Cape Fox shall not be required to \nselect or receive conveyance of the approximately 160 acres of \nunconveyed Federal land located within sec. 1, T.75 S., R.91 E., Copper \nRiver Meridian.\n\nSEC. 3.

USE OF INCENTIVES TO RESTORE FOREST SERVICE FINANCIAL \n              ACCOUNTABILITY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Section 3521(e) of title 31, United States Code, \n        requires the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture \n        to audit the annual financial statements required to be \n        prepared by the Forest Service. As a result of the inability of \n        the Forest Service to produce reliable financial statements, \n        the agency has received four successive adverse opinions or \n        disclaimers from the Inspector General.\n            (2) In January 1999, the Comptroller General submitted a \n        report to Congress that identified the Forest Service as an \n        agency at ``high risk'' of waste, fraud, abuse, and \n        mismanagement due to the persistent and severe weaknesses in \n        the Forest Service's accounting and financial reporting \n        systems.\n            (3) The Comptroller General has stated that the Forest \n        Service will maintain its high risk status until the agency, at \n        a minimum--\n                    (A) receives two consecutive unqualified audit \n                opinions from the Inspector General; and\n                    (B) corrects the material internal control \n                weaknesses, identified in the Inspector General's audit \n                reports of the financial statements of the Forest \n                Service, which adversely affect the ability of the \n                Forest Service to maintain accountability over its \n                assets on an ongoing basis.\n            (4) Despite initial efforts on the part of the Forest \n        Service to correct deficiencies in its financial management \n        systems, the Comptroller General and the Inspector General of \n        the Department of Agriculture have indicated that the Forest \n        Service may still be years away from producing reliable \n        financial statements or changing its high risk status.\n            (5) Performance incentives are necessary to ultimately \n        restore financial accountability to the Forest Service, and \n        such incentives must be structured so as to preserve the \n        ability of the Forest Service to perform its core missions, \n        particularly a sustained reduction of the natural resources \n        restoration and maintenance backlog within the National Forest \n        System, while safeguarding further investments of taxpayer \n        dollars from waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\n    (b) Conditional Limitations on Forest Service Appropriations.--\nSubject to subsections (c) and (d), for fiscal years beginning after \nthe date of the enactment of this Act, the total amount appropriated \nfor the Forest Service to carry out discretionary programs and \nactivities for a fiscal year shall not exceed the sum of the amounts \nappropriated under the heading ``Forest Service'' in title II of the \nDepartment of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n1999 (as contained in section 101(e) of division A of Public Law 105-\n277; 112 Stat. 2681-268).\n    (c) Removal of Condition.--The limitations on the level of Forest \nService appropriations or obligations specified in subsection (b) shall \nterminate on the earlier of the following:\n            (1) The date on which the Forest Service is no longer an \n        agency at high risk of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement \n        due to weaknesses in its accounting and financial reporting \n        systems, as determined under subsection (d).\n            (2) The end of the fifth fiscal year subject to the \n        limitations.\n    (d) Criteria for Removal of High Risk Status.--The Forest Service \nshall no longer be an agency at high risk under subsection (c)(1) if \nthe Comptroller General certifies in writing to Congress that Forest \nService financial management is no longer at high risk. The Comptroller \nGeneral may make that certification only if--\n            (1) the Forest Service receives two consecutive unqualified \n        audit opinions from the Inspector General of the Department of \n        Agriculture under section 3521(e) of title 31, United States \n        Code; and\n            (2) the Forest Service corrects the material weaknesses \n        identified in the audit reports of the Inspector General \n        regarding the Forest Service's fiscal year 1995 financial \n        statements and all subsequent audit reports of the Inspector \n        General regarding the Forest Service's financial statements \n        published before the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (e) Backlog Reduction Outputs.--During each fiscal year identified \nin subsection (c)(2), the Forest Service shall maintain or increase \noutputs, relative to the levels achieved during fiscal year 1999, from \nprograms that directly reduce the natural resources restoration and \nmaintenance backlog within the National Forest System. Such outputs \nshall include the following:\n            (1) Acres of forested land treated for reduction of \n        wildfire risk.\n            (2) Acres of forested land treated for reduction of \n        mortality risk from insect and disease infestation.\n            (3) Miles of roads and trails reconstructed or maintained.\n            (4) Number of recreational facilities reconstructed or \n        maintained.\n            (5) Acres of terrestrial habitat restored or enhanced.\n            (6) Miles of riparian areas restored or enhanced.\n            (7) Other priority outputs identified by the Secretary.",

      "document": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Merchant Marine of World War II \nCongressional Gold Medal Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory \n        in World War II and the restoration of peacetime across the \n        European and Pacific theaters.\n            (2) The United States Merchant Marine was integral in \n        providing the link between domestic production and the fighting \n        forces overseas, providing combat equipment, fuel, food, \n        commodities, and raw materials to troops stationed overseas.\n            (3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowledged the \n        indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the victory in a \n        1945 letter stating that without their support, ``the Navy \n        could not have accomplished its mission''.\n            (4) President and former Supreme Commander of the Allied \n        Forces, Dwight D. Eisenhower, acknowledged that ``through the \n        prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed forces \n        overseas, and of cargoes representing economic and military aid \n        to friendly nations, the American Merchant Marine has \n        effectively helped to strengthen the forces of freedom \n        throughout the world''.\n            (5) Military missions and war planning were contingent upon \n        the availability of resources and that the United States \n        Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, ensuring \n        the efficient and reliable transoceanic transport of military \n        equipment as well as both military and civilian personnel.\n            (6) The United States Merchant Marine provided for the \n        successful transport of resources and personnel despite \n        consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both \n        the air and the sea, such as enemy bomber squadrons, \n        submarines, and mines.\n            (7) The efforts of the United States Merchant Marine were \n        not without sacrifices as they bore a higher per capita \n        casualty rate than any other branch of the military during the \n        war.\n            (8) The United States Merchant Marine proved to be an \n        instrumental asset on untold occasions, participating in every \n        landing operation by the United States Marine Corps from \n        Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima as well as providing, for instance, the \n        bulk tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of Normandy \n        which ``would not have been possible without the Merchant \n        Marine'', as a 1944 New York Times article observed.\n            (9) In also assessing their performance, General Dwight D. \n        Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command is quick \n        to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage, and \n        fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We \n        count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to duty as \n        we do our own; they have never failed us''.\n            (10) During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D. \n        Roosevelt stated, the Merchant Marine has ``delivered the goods \n        when and where needed in every theater of operations and across \n        every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and dangerous \n        transportation job ever undertaken. As time goes on, there will \n        be greater public understanding of our merchant fleet's record \n        during this war.''.\n            (11) The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine \n        are deserving of broader public recognition.\n            (12) The United States will be forever grateful and \n        indebted to the U.S. Merchant Marine for their effective, \n        reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in \n        enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World \n        War II; that these goods and resources saved thousands of lives \n        and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World War II.\n            (13) The Congressional Gold Medal will be an appropriate \n        way to shed further light on the service of the Merchant Marine \n        in World War II and the instrumental role they played in \n        winning World War II.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives \nand the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate \narrangements for the award, on behalf of the Congress, of a single gold \nmedal of appropriate design to the U.S. Merchant Marine of World War \nII, in recognition of their dedicated and vital service during World \nWar II.\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award referred to \nin subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter referred to \nas the ``Secretary'') shall strike the gold medal with suitable \nemblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n    (c) American Merchant Marine Museum.--\n            (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in \n        honor of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the gold medal shall be \n        given to the American Merchant Marine Museum, where it will be \n        available for display as appropriate and available for \n        research.\n\nSEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n    Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the \nSecretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal \nstruck under section 3, at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the \nmedals, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \noverhead expenses.\n\nSEC. 5.

Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?\" he said.\n\nThe group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK.\n\nThey have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken.\n\nThe United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations.\n\nAbout 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there.\n\nMost are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group.\n\nAround half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said.\n\nThe latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey.\n\nThe three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail.\n\nThey had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul.\n\nFadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was \"taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria\".\n\nHe said there was now \"more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria\".\n\nThe Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning.\n\nIn February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria.\n\nShamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.\n\nTurkish officials said they had not been warned promptly enough by British police to intercept them - Scotland Yard denied this.",

      "document": "the difficulty in making the correct diagnosis because of the multitude of coinfections and comorbidities in the hiv population led the authors to a first erroneous diagnosis almost compromising the results of treatment . this experience is discussed further in the text . \n the patient wpo , from the city of so paulo ( brazil ) , a 75-year - old caucasian male , had been receiving antiretroviral treatment in hospital das clnicas of so paulo , since being diagnosed with hiv 12 years earlier ( now taking lamivudine , tenofovir , atazanavir , and ritonavir for the last three years ) . \n he was in a good general condition , with good viral and immunological control ( undetectable viral load and cd4 count of 653/ml ) . \n other laboratory tests were normal , and he did not have any other coinfections , had no drug addiction , and no other comorbidities . \n he sought medical assistance because of a complaint of patellofemoral pain in his right knee that had started one year earlier with increasing local volume and progressive inability to perform active extension . \n he had a knee extension lag of 30. he was able to walk only with a stick . \n the increased volume was concentrated below the patella and posterior to the patellar tendon , without local inflammatory signs , history of trauma , and infection . \n in addition , a tendinopathy with partial chronic lesion of the patellar tendon probably explained the clinical findings . \n it was decided first to perform a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) [ figures 1 and 2 ] . \n this revealed the presence of edema and thickening of the infrapatellar fat , with the formation of a nodule measuring 2.01.62.0 cm , with low signal and no impregnation with contrast . \n the patellar tendon was found thickened , with foci of partial ruptures and with peritendinous edema . \n sagital mri image , showing thickening of hoffa 's fat pad and adjacent synovial membrane , with foci of partial rupture of the patellar tendon axial mri image , showing a solid fibrous mass in hoffa 's fat pad the treatment for this situation is essentially nonsurgical . since our patient did not show any improvement through physiotherapy and drug treatment , surgical treatment was indicated . \n this was done with the aim of exploring the patellar tendon and reconstructing it if necessary , along with partial resection of hoffa 's fat and the nodule , with pathological analysis of the tissue . \n the intraoperative appearance of the knee showed an intact patellar tendon with an infiltrated tissue around hoffa 's fat , without any local inflammatory reaction [ figure 3 ] . \n it was decided only to biopsy this tissue and culture for bacteria , mycobacteria , and fungi . \n intraoperative aspect of the lesion in hoffa 's fat pad , with an intact patellar tendon none of the cultures was positive . on the 14 day after the operation , the results from the anatomopathological examination revealed that the nodule consisted of a high - grade malignant fibrohistiocytoma , without sufficient margins of resection . \n after ruling out metastasis [ by thoracic and abdomen computed tomography ( ct ) and bone scintigraphy ] , our patient underwent bloc resection of the entire joint , including the distal femur , proximal tibia , patella , and musculature of the distal quadriceps . \n the knee joint was reconstructed using an endoprosthesis , which was covered by rotating a flap from the medial gastrocnemius muscle and the extensor mechanism was reconstructed using the sartorius muscle . \n the patient has a good functional outcome , walking with the aid of one crutch and without any recidive after 18 months of the surgery . \n the most common causes for this pain are degenerative or traumatic modifications of the patellar and trochlear cartilage , tendonitis , inflammatory processes of hoffa 's fat , and patellar dysfunction caused by muscle weakness , shortening , or instability . \n the pain - specific localization was suggestive of an inflammatory process in hoffa 's fat or chronic partial lesion of the patellar tendon , which would explain the active extension deficit . within the context of considerable increase in life expectancy among patients infected with hiv achieved since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) , certain osteoarticular consequences of prolonged duration of viral infection and its treatment \n have been observed , such as osteopenia / osteoporosis , osteonecrosis , carpal tunnel syndrome , adhesive capsulitis of the shoulders , modifications of body shape , and changes in lipid and glucose metabolism . \n a care and study group called the  bone - hiv  group was created in our hospital to assist patients with hiv / aids presenting any orthopedic complaint . \n the medical literature on this orthopedic abnormality is very sparse , and we have not found any reports or epidemiological characterization of patellofemoral pathological conditions among this group of patients . \n one of the few studies on this subject in the literature described abnormalities in hoffa 's fat in patients with hiv , which may have an etiological link to patellofemoral pain . \n so , the typical changes induced by long - term infection and therapy of hiv may have a negative impact on the extensor mechanism of the knee , which led us to an erroneous initial diagnosis , instead of a much more aggressive disease . \n malignant fibrohistiocytoma was first described in 1964 and is currently known as high - grade pleomorphic sarcoma in adult life . \n malignant fibrohistiocytoma usually presents as a deep painless mass , without other local or systemic symptoms . \n the staging depends on the histological grade , size , and presence of metastasis , which is the most important prognostic factor regarding survival . \n radiotherapy is administered in most cases , with good results relating to local control , either before or after the surgery . \n the role of chemotherapy is unclear , but it can be administered particularly in cases with a high risk of metastases . in this case , \n chemotherapy was not used because of unclear evidence of benefit and the risk of side effects . \n as the case evolved , it became clear that the abnormalities in the patient 's knee were unrelated to his chronic hiv infection . \n however , this case once again raises the issue of lack of knowledge of the long - term changes caused by this disease . \n since there have been sporadic reports of abnormalities of hoffa 's fat among such patients , along with the nonspecific presentation of the condition in our patient , we were led to believe that his condition could have been related to hiv . \n we again emphasize that studies on osteoarticular changes ( such as bone density , muscular mass , joint mechanics , and cartilage loading ) induced by chronic hiv infection need to be conducted , to epidemiologically define this population better and diminish the frequency of erroneous diagnoses among patients with hiv / aids .",
      "summary": "this case report describes a patient presenting with anterior knee pain ( extensor mechanism pain ) , a poorly studied complaint in the hiv population . \n the final diagnosis was malignant fibrohistiocytoma , a rare condition among knee pathologies , successfully treated with endoprosthesis after tumor resection . \n this article focuses on what the authors learned after treating this patient , particularly on the difficulty in making a correct diagnosis of this group of patients due to lack of adequate epidemiological characterization . by assuming that the pathology was related to long - term infection and treatment of hiv ( knee hoffitis ) \n , the authors underestimated the gravity of the case , almost compromising the result of treatment .",

      "document": "CMS uses the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule to pay physicians and other providers for services delivered to beneficiaries. Physicians and other providers bill Medicare for their services using various five-digit billing codes based in part on codes developed by an AMA panel. Each year, the panel receives proposals from provider groups and others to revise existing billing codes or create new codes. The panel requires those who submit proposals to develop a clinical vignette that describes the typical patient who would receive the service, the diagnosis and relevant conditions, and estimates of time that physicians might spend in providing the service for the typical patient. The panel applies several criteria in reviewing these proposals. For example, a new code should represent a unique, well-defined procedure or service clearly identified and distinguished from existing procedures and services; should not fragment an existing procedure or service represented by one or more existing codes; should reflect the typical (not extraordinary) circumstances related to the delivery of the service; should be performed by many physicians or other qualified health care professionals across the United States; and should be consistent with current medical practice. CMS pays providers a fixed amount known as the Medicare fee for each code. The fees are based on relative values\u2014estimates of resources for the physician\u2019s work (time, skill, and level of training), and practice expenses (the costs of running a practice such as salaries of non- physician employees, rent, and overhead) required to provide a service relative to all other services. In setting fees, CMS also does not allow certain codes to be billed together if it deems that payment for one code is already included in another. CMS establishes and updates relative values annually. By law, the effect of any changes to its payment rates generally must be budget neutral. That is, if total spending increases by more than $20 million each year, including due to the creation of new billing codes, fees for all services would have to be reduced accordingly. Services billed under the physician fee schedule may be provided in a variety of settings, including physicians\u2019 offices and institutional settings such as hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and hospices. Non-physicians may also bill or be reimbursed by Medicare for services under certain circumstances. For example, some types of non-physicians practicing independently\u2014such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners\u2014 may bill Medicare for certain services that they are legally authorized to perform under their respective state laws. In other instances, physicians may bill as if they had furnished services that were provided by non- physician staff that they employ or with whom they have a contractual relationship as long as the physician has an established relationship with the beneficiary, and is on the premises to provide supervision if necessary. Providers and other stakeholders have noted that they care for an elderly population with increasingly complex medical conditions who receive care from multiple providers across different sites of care including physicians\u2019 offices, hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices. As such, the focus of primary care has shifted from treating specific medical conditions to increased care coordination and planning. CMS also noted that a new trend in care planning is the use of shared care plans between the beneficiary and the provider rather than those created solely by the provider. These jointly developed care plans can be particularly important to improving overall beneficiary outcomes for beneficiaries with serious illnesses and also allow other providers involved in the beneficiary\u2019s care access to timely information that supports planned care. However, stakeholders have suggested that Medicare\u2019s payment system does not fully reimburse providers for such care planning services. For example, some note that the E/M billing codes that primary care physicians generally use to bill for their services were developed at a time when care coordination and planning was not part of the standard practice of medicine; as such, these codes do not reflect time spent on activities that do not require a face-to-face encounter with the beneficiary, including medical conferences with other physicians, or telephone calls to coordinate care with other providers. Some primary care physicians have requested that CMS conduct a comprehensive review of existing E/M codes to ensure they account for time spent on these services, or develop new codes that primary care physicians may exclusively use to bill for these services. However, others have noted that E/M codes have been reviewed and valued by the AMA, and the codes account for the time spent on these services. Moreover, they have stated that care coordination and planning services are delivered by multiple specialties, not just primary care physicians. Our analysis identified at least 58 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule billing codes that providers may use to bill for LCCP-type services. These 58 billing codes generally contain components we determined to be equivalent to the five key components of the LCCP service as defined in the 2018 BBA. For example, all 58 codes included a provision for the development of a care plan that addresses the beneficiary\u2019s goals, values, and preferences, and a provision for coordination with other providers, which is equivalent to the LCCP component related to interdisciplinary care. Providers may choose a single code or a combination of these codes to account for the time, skill, and resources needed to deliver the service based on the unique health needs of each patient. (See app. IV for more information on the 58 codes and the LCCP components they contain as defined in the 2018 BBA.) The 58 billing codes for LCCP-type services include 45 longstanding, broadly-defined codes and 13 narrowly-defined codes that were more recently introduced starting in 2013. Broadly-defined codes. Of the 45 broadly-defined codes, 39 are E/M codes that have existed for decades. E/M codes are broadly defined to include services provided to treat a variety of illnesses (for example, treatment of a particular medical complaint), but they may also be used to bill for LCCP-type services. In general, the E/M codes range in complexity from low to high depending on the amount of time the provider spends with a patient as well as the complexity of the medical condition(s) being treated. E/M codes may also be billed if more than 50 percent of the time allotted for the service is spent on counseling and care coordination\u2014for example, explaining treatment options and ways to mitigate the patient\u2019s health risks\u2014which are key components of the LCCP service as defined in the 2018 BBA. The E/M codes we identified as representing LCCP-type services were the more complex codes that had estimates of time that may be spent providing the service to a typical patient ranging from 30 to 120 minutes of physician time and 3 to 71 minutes of non-physician time. While the majority of E/M codes have existed for decades, CMS added six new E/M codes starting in 2008\u2014referred to as \u201cprolonged\u201d E/M codes\u2014allowing payment for additional time for care planning and care management services for complex conditions. Narrowly-defined codes. Starting in 2013, CMS added 13 narrowly- defined LCCP-type codes to better account for the time spent coordinating care for patients with complex treatment needs. CMS implemented these more narrowly-defined care planning codes largely in response to provider complaints that E/M codes did not sufficiently account for extensive care management/coordination of care that was required across multiple providers and settings. Unlike broadly-defined codes, these narrowly-defined codes can only be used for LCCP-type services. The 13 narrowly-defined LCCP-type codes fall into four types: transitional care management (TCM), chronic care management (CCM), advance care planning (ACP), and behavioral health integration (BHI). (See table 1.) While some pertain to patients with specific types of health conditions or in certain settings, others are more general and may be used for a range of health conditions. The estimates of physician and non-physician time that may be spent on the broadly-defined and narrowly-defined codes vary, as does Medicare\u2019s 2019 fees for these billing codes\u2014see examples of commonly used LCCP-type billing codes in table 2 and see appendix IV for related information on all 58 LCCP-type billing codes. For example, some stakeholders told us they might bill a complex E/M code (99214) along with a CCM code (99487). As our analysis shows, this combination could result in the provider spending 66 minutes of physician time and 113 minutes of non-physician time for a typical beneficiary, and receiving total Medicare fees of about $203 in 2019. Overall Medicare spending on LCCP-type services represented by the 58 billing codes we identified increased from $26 billion in 2013 to $29 billion in 2017, an 11 percent increase. The vast majority of this spending\u2014 about $28.3 billion in 2017\u2014was on services represented by the 45 broadly-defined codes we identified earlier (henceforth we refer to these services as \u201cbroadly-defined services.\u201d) By comparison, Medicare spending on LCCP-type services represented by the 13 narrowly-defined codes (henceforth referred to as \u201cnarrowly-defined services\u201d) was about $467 million in 2017. Though smaller in terms of total dollars, spending on narrowly-defined services grew at a higher rate than spending on broadly-defined services, from about $2 per beneficiary in 2013 to $14 per beneficiary in 2017. This higher rate in growth can mostly be attributed to these four new types of services being introduced during this 4 year period. For example, as Table 1 shows, two TCM codes were introduced in 2013 and four CCM codes were introduced from 2015 to 2017. In contrast, spending growth for broadly-defined services was much smaller, increasing from about $785 per beneficiary in 2013 to $844 per beneficiary in 2017. For all other Medicare Physician Fee Schedule services combined, per-beneficiary spending decreased from about $1,488 in 2013 to $1,426 in 2017. Spending on CCM and TCM services accounted for most of the total spending on narrowly-defined LCCP-type services from 2013 to 2017. (See fig. 1.) For example, in 2017, TCM services accounted for almost half ($213 million of the total spending of $467 million), while spending on CCM services accounted for over a third ($162 million of the $467 million). The growth in spending on narrowly-defined services was driven by increased utilization\u2014that can be attributed in part to the development of new codes for these services\u2014rather than increases in Medicare fees for these services. Specifically, utilization of narrowly-defined services increased from about 9 services per 1,000 beneficiaries in 2013 to about 177 services per 1,000 beneficiaries in 2017. Average Medicare fees for these services remained flat during this period. The number of beneficiaries receiving narrowly-defined LCCP-type services increased substantially from 2013 to 2017, as more of these Medicare billing codes were added and began to be utilized during this time. Specifically, in 2017, about 2.5 million beneficiaries received narrowly-defined LCCP-type services, representing an 839 percent increase from about 267,000 beneficiaries in 2013. (See fig. 2.) While the overall number of beneficiaries receiving narrowly-defined services increased, these services were concentrated among a relatively small share of Medicare beneficiaries. Specifically, one-quarter of beneficiaries who received any of the narrowly-defined services in 2017 received 62 percent of the approximately 6 million services that were provided that year. (See fig. 3.) In 2017, of the total 2.5 million beneficiaries that received narrowly- defined services, 90 percent received only one type of narrowly-defined LCCP-type service. (See fig. 4.) In contrast, only 10 percent of beneficiaries received multiple types of narrowly-defined LCCP-type services, the most common combination being CCM and ACP. Mirroring beneficiary trends, the number of Medicare providers billing for narrowly-defined LCCP-type services also increased significantly from 2013 through 2017, as these Medicare billing codes were established and began to be utilized during this time. In 2017, a total of about 100,000 providers billed for narrowly-defined services, representing a 227 percent increase from about 31,000 providers in 2013. (See fig. 5.) As with beneficiary trends, while the overall number of providers billing narrowly-defined services grew from 2013 to 2017, billing for these services was also increasingly concentrated among a small share of providers. Specifically, in 2017, 10 percent of providers who billed for any narrowly-defined services billed about 76 percent of the approximately 6 million services that were provided in that year. (See fig. 6.) Each year from 2013 through 2017, physicians specializing in internal medicine accounted for the largest share of spending on narrowly-defined LCCP-type services. In 2017, internal medicine accounted for 45 percent of the $467 million in total Medicare spending on narrowly-defined services. (See fig. 7.) Family practice and nurse practitioners were the other specialties accounting for the greatest shares of spending. In terms of the setting in which narrowly-defined LCCP-type services were provided, the majority were provided in nonfacility settings such as physicians\u2019 offices. Specifically, in 2017, 94 percent of narrowly-defined services were provided in nonfacility settings. This trend was consistent over each of the 5 years from 2013 to 2017. Six of the 19 stakeholders we interviewed did not support the creation of a new billing code for an LCCP service as defined in the 2018 BBA. Two of these\u2014representing physician specialties that together accounted for almost one-fifth of total spending on LCCP-type services in 2017\u2014stated that the existing billing codes were sufficient for them to provide and bill for the full range of the LCCP service. They stated that billing either a single code or a combination of an E/M code and one or more of the 13 narrowly-defined LCCP-type codes we identified allowed them to account for the full range of the LCCP service as defined in the BBA. As such, the two stakeholders said, there was no need for a new billing code. The remaining four stakeholders expressed concerns about creating a new billing code for an LCCP service. These concerns included the following: Overlap with existing codes that require the development of care plans: While not explicitly stating that existing codes were sufficient, some stakeholders said that if a new billing code were created for the LCCP service as defined in the 2018 BBA, it would overlap with or duplicate existing billing codes. For example, three stakeholders noted potential overlap with existing billing codes, such as the ACP and CCM. Three stakeholders said that the care plan that would be required under the new LCCP code would duplicate existing care plans that are required by law for beneficiaries in hospices or skilled nursing facilities. In addition, two stakeholders noted that providers in their specialty already prepare detailed care plans as a standard practice of care when evaluating their patients and billing for these services using existing E/M billing codes. They stated that these care plans exceed the components of the care plan specified in the 2018 BBA. Stakeholders noted that the existence of multiple overlapping codes that include the development of a care plan could create confusion for providers in choosing the most appropriate billing code. Concerns about code proliferation or code fragmentation: Several stakeholders were concerned that adding another code to Medicare\u2019s billing system could result in increased Medicare spending and less, rather than more, care coordination. Specifically, two stakeholders stated that having multiple billing codes for care planning and care management, respectively, would have the potential to increase spending because multiple providers could start billing the new codes even though one provider may have primary responsibility for the beneficiary. (In contrast, under the existing billing codes a single code that encompassed both types of services could be billed.) For example, one of these stakeholders said that primary care physicians generally referred beneficiaries with complex treatment needs to a surgeon or specialist who then both planned and managed the beneficiary\u2019s care, yet the primary care physician might also bill the care planning billing code. In addition to the potential for increased Medicare spending, three stakeholders said that code fragmentation\u2014splitting existing billing codes into multiple codes for services that were previously bundled together\u2014was contrary to the comprehensive patient-centered model of care that Medicare was moving towards. Specifically, one provider stated that under such a model, rather than billing multiple different codes for care planning and coordination, a primary care practice is paid a monthly management fee to (among other things) improve care coordination for patients who receive most of their primary care services from that practice. While six of the stakeholders we interviewed did not support creating a new LCCP code, the remaining 13 stakeholders told us that such a billing code is needed. According to the stakeholders, a new LCCP code as defined in the 2018 BBA could address several concerns they identified in Medicare\u2019s existing billing codes related to the provision of the LCCP service. However, some of these concerns could be addressed under the current Medicare billing framework, as shown by our analysis of available data. For example, stakeholders identified the following limitations that could be addressed by a new LCCP code: Inadequate reimbursement for time spent on interdisciplinary care: The 13 stakeholders stated that Medicare\u2019s existing billing codes either did not require or did not sufficiently reimburse them for the time spent on interdisciplinary care. They stated there should be a separate code to reimburse this type of care. However, stakeholders representing two specialties told us they had proposed such a code to the AMA but the AMA had rejected their proposals because interdisciplinary care is already accounted for in the existing billing codes. Moreover, as our analysis of the 58 billing codes shows, the majority of these codes include a provision for consultation and coordination among providers that is equivalent to input from an interdisciplinary team. With regard to inadequate reimbursement, as another stakeholder noted, providers may bill a complex E/M service along with a narrowly-defined LCCP-type service such as CCM. The total reimbursement for such a combination of codes would be about $203 as of 2019. (See table 2.) Insufficient physician time for care planning: Six stakeholders representing a mix of primary care and medical specialties stated the existing billing codes (including the more complex E/M codes) had insufficient physician time to provide both care planning and care management, which they maintained are separate and distinct activities. They stated a new code could include the appropriate time needed. One stakeholder said that care planning requires at least 30 minutes of time, and the complex E/M codes do not allow providers to bill for the time it takes to provide both the care management of a complex patient as well as care planning for the patient. According to the stakeholder, for example, if a provider bills a complex E/M code that allows for 40 minutes of physician time, that is insufficient to provide both types of services. While CMS has recently established new prolonged E/M codes (which allow for an additional 60 minutes of time), the stakeholder noted that they do not address the problem of insufficient time because a prolonged E/M code may only be billed with a companion E/M code, and the threshold of time needed to bill the two codes together is now too high\u2014specifically 40 minutes for the complex E/M code plus 60 minutes for the prolonged E/M code. However, our review of CMS guidance on billing of prolonged E/M codes shows that providers do not have to meet the full 60 minutes of time in order to bill a prolonged E/M code; they may bill it as long as the total time spent on the visit exceeds the typical time for the E/M visit plus 30 minutes. Documentation requirements: Three stakeholders, largely representing primary care and medical specialties, stated that burdensome documentation requirements for the more complex E/M codes hampered their ability to bill these codes. They suggested that a new billing code could be structured similar to the new ACP or CCM codes which do not have the same documentation requirements. While these stakeholders expressed concern regarding documentation as a discouraging factor, our analysis of 2017 Medicare claims data showed that certain specialties, including some that had expressed this concern, billed the more complex codes at a significantly higher rate than the average across all specialties. This may indicate that these documentation requirements do not necessarily preclude providers from billing these codes. For example, 83 percent of all the E/M new patient visits billed by geriatricians in 2017 were billed using the more complex E/M codes, compared to 48 percent on average. Similarly, 80 percent of all the E/M established patient visits billed by clinical psychologists in 2017 were billed using the more complex E/M codes compared to 50 percent on average. See appendix V for details on billing patterns for all medical specialties. Inability of non-physician staff to independently bill for care planning: Seven stakeholders expressed concerns that non-physician staff such as nurses and social workers cannot independently bill the existing Medicare billing codes that we identified as being LCCP-type services. As one stakeholder explained, non-physician staff may spend time providing coordination and care planning services separately rather than concurrently with the physician, but they cannot bill for this time independently because the physician was not present. These stakeholders stated that a new LCCP code that could be billed by physicians and non-physicians that participated in the care planning process could address this issue. However, other stakeholders expressed concerns about the effect on Medicare spending if multiple providers billed for an LCCP service. Moreover, reimbursement for non-physicians is built into Medicare fees. Specifically, Medicare\u2019s fee for each billing code includes reimbursement for physician\u2019s time as well as their practice expenses (which cover the costs of non-physician staff), and when the AMA panel develops resources estimates for each billing code (upon which Medicare fees are based), it considers the amount of non-physician time spent on that code. Certain non-physician practitioners, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants, may also independently bill services under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule subject to certain requirements, and as specified in their scope of practice under state law. Stakeholders generally concurred that if a new LCCP code were implemented, the definition of interdisciplinary care should be flexible and not require a social worker. Currently, the LCCP billing code as defined in the 2018 BBA requires that the interdisciplinary team providing care planning services include a social worker. However, 13 stakeholders stated that a typical practice did not include a social worker, but rather included a nurse who might perform the functions of a social worker. They stated that smaller office-based medical practices could not afford to hire a social worker. The stakeholders concurred that social workers were generally available in larger integrated practices (such as a single or multiple groups aligning with each other or with a larger hospital system) and in facility settings such as hospitals or skilled nursing facilities. (Stakeholders also provided other comments on the structure of a potential new billing code for the LCCP service should such a code be established by CMS, which we summarize in app. VI.) We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment. HHS provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and other interested parties.

GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix VII. Appendix II: Longitudinal Comprehensive Care Planning Service Components in the Balanced Budget Act of 2018 Pub. L. No. 115-123, \u00a7 50342(c)(4), 132 Stat. 211. We identified 58 billing codes in Medicare\u2019s physician fee schedule that may be used to bill for LCCP-type services as defined in the Balanced Budget Act of 2018 (2018 BBA). Figure 9 shows relevant information on these billing codes including the short descriptor, beneficiary eligibility criteria, our analysis of whether the billing code\u2019s components are equivalent to the components of an LCCP service as defined in the 2018 BBA, and Medicare\u2019s 2019 fee. Medicare\u2019s physician fee schedule contains evaluation and management (E/M) codes that providers may use to bill for face-to-face visits in their offices or other settings such as hospitals. These codes range in complexity from low to high depending on the amount of time the provider spends with a patient as well as the complexity of the medical decision- making and the medical condition(s) being treated. Table 4 shows the percentage of each specialty\u2019s E/M visits that were billed as complex visits (moderate or high complexity). In general, primary care and medical sub-specialties tended to bill complex visits at a higher rate than the all- specialty average, while surgical specialties tended to bill complex visits at a lower rate than the all-specialty average. We interviewed 19 stakeholders including national umbrella groups of physicians and other providers to obtain their perspectives on the structure of a new billing code for LCCP-type services as defined in the Balanced Budget Act of 2018 (2018 BBA), regardless of whether they supported the creation of a new code. Stakeholders were generally in agreement that a new billing code for LCCP-type services as defined in the 2018 BBA, if implemented, should be broadly defined. Specifically, stakeholders stated that it should not be tied to a specific condition, should allow for both in-person and non-face-to-face services performed when the beneficiary was not present, should be billable more than once, should be available for billing by both primary care physicians and specialists, and should have restrictions to avoid duplicative billing with existing billing that provided overlapping services. However, stakeholders had more mixed views about what these specific restrictions should be. Stakeholder views about the various structural components or restrictions included the following: Applicable medical conditions: The majority of stakeholders (13 of the 17 who responded to this question) stated that the new code should be broadly defined although they differed in their opinions of what broadly-defined meant; one stakeholder cautioned against an overly broad definition, and one suggested pilot testing with a discrete list of conditions. Of the 13 stakeholders in favor of a broad definition, 12 stated that the new billing code should not be tied to any particular specific illness or medical condition but should be flexible in structure. Three stakeholders stated that the extent of beneficiaries\u2019 daily functioning or quality of life should also be considered when defining applicable medical conditions. For example, a beneficiary who is not necessarily suffering from a life-threatening illness but is unable to perform the functions of daily living (such as bathing and eating) needs extensive care planning and should therefore be covered under the new LCCP-type service. Three stakeholders stated that the new code should be billable if a beneficiary\u2019s existing diagnosis of a serious illness changed. Three stakeholders stated that a potential new code could be modeled along the lines of existing billing codes\u2014specifically the advance care planning (ACP) or chronic care management (CCM) codes\u2014 which do not specify any particular medical condition. Two stakeholders said that a new code should not be so broad that it could apply to a vast majority of beneficiaries. For example, one stakeholder stated that the American Medical Association would likely not approve a code for a generic serious condition because it would be difficult to differentiate that code from an existing billing code, such as an evaluation and management (E/M) code, which may be used for any medical condition including serious, life-threatening conditions. One stakeholder suggested pilot testing the code with a discrete list of conditions, with the intention of expanding the list afterwards. In-person or non-face-to-face: The majority of stakeholders (12 of the 15 that responded to this question) stated that a potential new code should allow for both in-person and non-face-to-face activities (such as virtual or telehealth\u2014providing clinical care remotely by two-way video, phone calls with the beneficiary or to arrange referrals or coordinate care with other providers when the beneficiary was not present); three said it should only include face-to-face activities. Twelve stakeholders stated that the visit should include both types of activities. For example, one stakeholder said the initial visit for LCCP-type services should be in-person, and follow up activities such as updating a care plan or remote patient monitoring (monitoring of patients outside of conventional settings) could be non-face-to-face. Three stakeholders said it should only include face-to-face activities either because of concerns about the potential for overbilling if the new code included non-face-to-face activities which might be difficult to verify or because other existing codes, such as CCM, already cover non-face-to-face activities. Frequency of billing: All of the 16 stakeholders responding to this question concurred that the new code should be billable more frequently than on a one-time basis, although opinions varied on the exact frequency. Nine stakeholders said the code should be billable on an ongoing basis as the beneficiary\u2019s condition changes. For example, one said that the new code should be on-going because the care planning and treatment would continue to evolve over time as the beneficiary\u2019s condition changes. Seven other stakeholders said that while it should not be an ongoing service, it should be billable more frequently than once. For example, one stakeholder specified that it could be billed once per month or over every three months, but that a target end date must be specified; otherwise, it would be too similar to existing billing codes such as the CCM code that may be billed monthly. Two other stakeholders said it could be billed up to 4-5 times a year. Other billing restrictions: All 12 stakeholders responding to this question indicated that restrictions would be necessary to avoid overlap with existing billing codes. For example, three stakeholders suggested that the new code could be billed along with an E/M code for additional services not covered by the E/M code as long as it does not overlap with other existing codes that account for additional time beyond an E/M visit (such as the prolonged E/M visit billing codes). One suggested that it should not be billed along with any of the existing narrowly-defined LCCP-type codes, including CCM, transitional care management, or the ACP codes. One did not specify any particular code with which the new code should not be billed, but cautioned that care should be taken to ensure that time spent with the beneficiary was reported only once. Providers eligible to bill the code: The majority of stakeholders (13 of the 15 that responded to this question) stated that both primary care physicians and specialists should be eligible to bill the new code. Two of these stakeholders said that there should also be a requirement that the billing physician has an established relationship with the beneficiary. Two stakeholders said that only specialists should bill since they are generally the ones attending to the beneficiary\u2019s serious illness. Two stakeholders stated that non-physicians (including social workers) should also be able to bill the code as long as they are currently allowed to bill separately under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. In addition to the contact named above, Karen Doran, Assistant Director; Iola D\u2019Souza, Analyst-in-Charge; Sarah Belford; Krister Friday; John Lalomio; and Daniel Ries made key contributions to this report.

      "summary": "Medicare's physician fee schedule contains over 8,000 billing codes for office visits, surgical procedures, or other services provided to beneficiaries. Some provider groups have concerns that these codes do not sufficiently account for the LCCP-type services they provide to Medicare beneficiaries with complex medical needs. The BBA included a provision that GAO examine billing codes that may be used for LCCP-type services for beneficiaries with a serious or life-threatening illness. GAO identified, among other things, (1) existing Medicare physician fee schedule billing codes that can be used to bill LCCP-type services; and (2) trends in Medicare spending on these services from 2013 through 2017. GAO reviewed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) billing code manuals and American Medical Association (AMA) code descriptors to identify existing codes containing key components of LCCP-type services; analyzed Medicare Part B claims data from 2013 to 2017 (the most recent available at the time of GAO's review); and interviewed officials from CMS and 19 stakeholders, including the AMA, national physician groups, and other provider groups that had previously given input on the topic to Congress. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In response, HHS provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) defined longitudinal comprehensive care planning (LCCP) as services involving an interdisciplinary team of providers who develop and communicate a care plan to Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening illness. GAO identified at least 58 billing codes in Medicare's physician fee schedule that could be used by providers to bill for services that cover some or all of the LCCP service components as defined in the 2018 BBA \u2014referred to by GAO as LCCP-type services. The 58 billing codes may be used individually or in combination, depending on a beneficiary's medical needs. Stakeholders representing providers told GAO their members generally use one or a combination of these codes to bill for LCCP-type services. Forty-five of the 58 codes are broadly-defined longstanding codes that can be used for LCCP-type services as well as other services such as the treatment of a specific medical complaint. The remaining 13 codes are more recent narrowly-defined codes introduced starting in 2013 that only cover LCCP-type services. They include transitional care management services introduced in 2013, chronic care management starting in 2015, advance care planning in 2016, and behavioral health integration in 2017. GAO found that overall Medicare spending on LCCP-type services that were billed to the 58 codes increased from $26 billion in 2013 to almost $29 billion in 2017. While narrowly-defined services accounted for a small share of this total spending ($467 million in 2017), spending on these narrowly-defined services such as chronic care management increased rapidly. Moreover, spending growth on narrowly-defined services was driven by increased use of these services rather than increases in reimbursement rates. From 2013 through 2017, more beneficiaries received and more providers billed for narrowly-defined services. The number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving these services grew from about 267,000 to about 2.5 million. The number of providers billing these services grew from about 31,000 to about 100,000.",

specific symptoms , the clinical suspicion of prostate tuberculosis is difficult . \n here we report a case of a young , previously healthy , immunocompetent patient with miliary tuberculosis involving the prostate . \n we present a case of a 32-year - old immunocompetent iranian male who presented to the emergency room with a generalized tonic - clonic seizure lasting for 3 minutes . \n furthermore , he did not have any genitourinary symptoms , including dysuria , hematuria , or penile discharge . \n a computerized tomography ( ct ) scan of the head failed to show any acute central nervous system insult . \n prior to this admission , he gave history of an admission 12 months ago to a hospital outside the country , where he complained of fatigue , weight loss , and fever . \n reports from the hospital showed that he also had chronic moderate ascites and a left pleural effusion . \n however , several laboratory and imaging tests were done and it was concluded that there was no evidence of infectious disease , chronic liver disease , or malignancy . it was recommended that he may need more investigations or a laparoscopy with peritoneal tissue biopsy , which was not done . upon the latest admission , \n the respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute , the body temperature was 36.9c , and the blood pressure was 112/70 mmhg . \n digital rectal examination was not performed since the patient did not have any genitourinary or gastrointestinal symptoms . during this hospitalization , \n the laboratory investigations , urine routine and microscopy , cultures , virology screen , including human immunodeficiency virus , as well as the autoimmune markers did not show any significant issues . \n also , three sets of sputum acid - fast bacilli smears were done , which were all negative . \n a lumber puncture was also performed with a normal initial pressure , 0 mmcell count , glucose of 4.1 mm per liters , and protein of 764 mg per liter . at the same time \n a magnetic resonance image of the brain was done concluding multifocal enhancing foci suggestive of an infective process ( figure 1 ) . due to his previous history , ct - chest , \n the abdominal ct showed mild peritoneal ascites with evidence of mild splenomegaly . the ascetic fluid taken was translucent and yellow in color and the serum - ascites albumin gradient 5 gram per liter ( 0.5 gram per deciliter ) \n furthermore , the analysis was negative for ziehl  neelsen , gram stain , and culture . \n the pelvis ct also showed an enlargement of the prostate and a right prostate lesion extending to the seminal vesicles ( faint ring enhancing lesion measuring 32.73 cm ) ( figure 2 ) . \n the case was discussed with the patient and he agreed to start anti - tuberculosis treatment and to have a trans - rectal biopsy of the prostate . \n the biopsy showed multiple slides of necrotizing granulomata suggestive of tuberculosis ( figure 3 ) . \n neelsen stain was also performed , and the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis was confirmed ( figure 4 ) . he was started on anti - tuberculosis therapy with isoniazid , rifampicin , ethambutol , pyrazinamide , and pyridoxine for 12 months . at follow - up \n the patient was asymptomatic with a normal physical examination and laboratory tests with no drug side effects . \n this complication is seen in 1%3% of all tuberculosis cases.5 although most cases of miliary tuberculosis are treatable , the mortality rate among young adults with miliary tuberculosis remains 15% 20% and for adults 25%30%.2 one of the main causes for these high mortality rates includes late detection of disease caused by non - specific symptoms . \n tuberculosis of the prostate is rare and the literature is scarce . most often , the cases are under - reported , and easily missed . \n patients with prostatic tuberculosis usually present with non - specific symptoms except in rare cases . \n these rare cases present with irritative voiding symptoms , terminal dysuria or hemospermia.6 however this was not the case in our patient . \n the patient was asymptomatic and like most cases in the literature , tuberculosis of the prostate was diagnosed incidentally . as in our case , tuberculosis of the prostate \n is mainly diagnosed by pathologists where a trans - rectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate is the mainstay of the diagnosis.7 as wang and chang have demonstrated , it was the clinical usefulness of the contrast enhanced ct for the diagnosis of tuberculosis of the prostate in which low density multiple and bilateral lesions with irregular borders are seen that prompted us to further investigate the prostate.8 once the disease is diagnosed , the patient should receive a full course of anti - tubercular therapy . \n often , the presentation can be non - specific and misleading , as in our case . \n a strong clinical suspicion and availability of sophisticated tests with confirmation by biopsy , polymerase chain reaction , and culture are needed in order to avoid misdiagnosis of complicated miliary tuberculosis cases .",

this was followed by prednisone ( 1 mg / kg / day ) . \n the neurological state of the patient worsened rapidly and the patient died a week later . \n cerebral mri in postgadolinium axial t1-weighted image ( a ) and flair image ( b ) , showing a gyriform and nodular left frontal and parietal subcortical enhancement associated with an important perilesional edema \n more than 170 million people worldwide are infected with chronic viral hepatitis c. current antiviral treatments are effective in eradicating the virus in up to 60% of patients . \n pegylated ifn- plus ribavirin was found to be superior to all other protocols for sustained eradication of the hcv , especially in individuals with more resistant viral genotypes 1 , 4 , 5 , and 6 . \n although several reports have suggested an association between ifn therapy and sarcoidosis , this association was rarely described in the literature . in 1987 , abdi et al . \n had described the first case of pulmonary sarcoidosis in a patient who received ifn- treatment for renal cell cancer . since then , various cases have been published suggesting a relationship between sarcoidosis and ifn treatment in patients with a variety of diseases , including renal cell carcinoma , hematological malignancies , and viral hepatitis . \n so far , more than 30 cases of sarcoidosis occurring in the context of chronic hepatitis c treated by ifn- have been reported in the literature.[24 ] reported clinical manifestations include cutaneous sarcoidotic lesions , pulmonary nodules , and peripheral neuropathy . in this paper , we report the second case in the literature of severe central nervous system sarcoidosis secondary to ifn- treatment . to the best of our knowledge , \n only one case of neurosarcoidosis associated with ifn therapy has been reported in the literature . \n most of the cases described in the literature occurred in patients who have received a treatment combining ifn- or pegylated ifn- and ribavirin . \n indeed , it is well recognized that ifn- is an immunomodulator that has not only direct antiviral activity but also powerful stimulation of the immune activities , especially on t - helper ( th1 ) immune response[810 ] which is strongly involved in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis . \n furthermore , granulomas in sarcoidosis are associated with an abundance of cd4 t lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes , which are being considered a result of cytokine stimulation and immunologic dysregulation . \n importantly , in cases of chronic hepatitis c , inf could induce and reactivate sarcoidosis , and inf - based combination antiviral regimens can not eliminate the occurrence of sarcoidosis . \n in contrast , ribavirin , an antiviral agent that increases the anti - hcv effect of inf in chronic hepatitis c , would also enhance th1 cytokine response while inhibiting th2 cytokine response . \n furthermore , there was no case report of sarcoidosis in patients treated using ribavirin only . \n this suggests that the combination of inf- and ribavirin enhances the immune response , consequently predisposing the patient to sarcoidosis . \n the mean time to the onset of the disease after starting inf- therapy is 4 months . in our case , \n manifestations of sarcoidosis occurred earlier , associating rapid deterioration of clinical symptoms , which lead to death in 10 weeks . \n most patients with inf- associated sarcoidosis had spontaneous resolution of the disease without immunosuppressive treatment . \n indeed , inf- treatment was discontinued in several cases and subsequent resolution of sarcoidosis within months has followed . \n in contrast , the treatment protocol was not modified in other cases , and the sarcoidosis resolved several months later , either during or after the achievement of treatment . \n indeed , steroids that are the main treatment for systemic sarcoidosis increase the hcv load in both in vitro and in vivo . \n the prognosis of peripheral neurosarcoidosis is better as compared to the central nervous system involvement , which leads to higher disability and mortality . \n in addition , neurosarcoidosis of the cns usually occur in the early stages of the disease , while peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscle sarcoidosis are typically seen in the chronic stages of the disease . \n this would suggest that our patient has recent neurosarcoidosis after introducing inf- and ribavirin therapy . \n based on this case report , inf- associated sarcoidosis might also include cns involvement and might lead to death . considering earlier reports of heterogeneous spectra of sarcoidosis manifestations \n , clinicians should be aware of associated potential complication while evaluating the benefit / risk ratio of the treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis c infection . \n therefore , patients suggested such treatments are recommended to be monitored for sarcoidosis before and during ifn therapy .",
      "summary": "sarcoidosis is a chronic multisystemic granulomatous disease that is triggered by an autoimmune process . \n nowadays , this pathology represents a well - recognized but uncommon complication for antiviral treatment in hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection . \n herein , we report a remarkable case of 47-year - old woman treated for chronic hcv infection ; the patient has developed interferon alfa - induced sarcoidosis involving the central nervous system . \n the evolution was fatal despite disrupting the antiviral therapy and initiating a high - dose corticotherapy . \n this complication of interferon alfa treatment was reported in the literature in only one case . through this case and a review of the literature \n , we aim to underline the importance of screening for sarcoidosis before and during the follow - up of hcv patients undergoing antiviral therapy .",

divergent dislocation of the scaphoid and lunate . in this patient \n , the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments were sutured through the dorsal approach , the anterior capsule was sutured through the palmar approach , and the scapholunate and lunotriquetral joints were fixed with kirschner wires . to our knowledge , this is the first report in which interosseous ligaments were sutured by open surgery for divergent dislocation of the scaphoid and lunate . \n a 46-year - old man who fell from a height of 1.5  m onto his left hand was brought to the emergency center of our hospital and underwent a medical examination . \n radiography of the wrist revealed palmar - divergent dislocation of the scaphoid and lunate ( fig .  1 ) but with no neurovascular disturbance in the hand . \n seven days after the injury , open surgery was performed through the palmar and dorsal approaches . \n the dorsal approach showed ruptures of the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments , which were sutured with anchors . \n the palmar approach showed an oblique tear of the anterior capsule , which was sutured with absorbable threads . \n finally , the scapholunate and lunotriquetral joints were fixed with two kirschner wires , inserted from the scaphoid to the lunate and from the triquetrum to the lunate , respectively , and the wires were buried under the skin ( fig .  2 ) . \n a short arm plaster splint was applied postoperatively ; 2 weeks later , it was changed to a removable splint and rehabilitation was started . as kirschner wires remained in the carpal bones , range of motion ( rom ) exercises of the wrist were restricted to avoid wire failure . at 7 weeks , the kirschner wires and splint were removed , and the patient was started on intensive rehabilitation for an additional 3 months . at the 1-year follow -

      "document": "many people , approximately 20% of the population , suffer from allergic rhinitis worldwide . from the clinical point of view , \n allergic rhinitis causes sneezing , nasal discharge , and nasal obstruction . from the immunological point of view , \n allergic rhinitis is a typical th2 immune disorder characterized by a high level of antigen specific ige production . because the enhanced ige production and inflammatory response in rhinitis are due to predominant production of th2 cytokines such as il-4 , the allergic symptoms can be alleviated by inhibition of th2 cytokine responses . \n many researchers have investigated allergic rhinitis using an animal model.1 , 2 , 3 the model of allergic mice made by ova sensitization and challenge had increased serum ige and eosinophil . \n shin'iseihaito ( ssht ; magnolia flower lung - clearing decoction ;  xn y qng fi tng ) , a formula consisting of nine crude drugs , has been used for the treatment of nasal diseases such as chronic sinusitis in traditional japanese kampo medicine (  r bn hn y ) and traditional chinese medicine ( tcm ;  zhng y).4 , 5 more than 50% of individuals with allergic rhinitis have clinical or radiographic evidence of chronic sinusitis and 2558% of individuals with sinusitis have aeroallergen sensitization . \n previous researches suggest that chronic sinusitis could be an atopic disease driven by ige sensitization to aeroallergens . from these studies \n however , it has not been clarified for its role in anti - allergy therapy before . \n thus , in the present study , we investigated whether ssht is able to suppress the murine allergic reaction induced by nasal sensitization . \n female balb / c mice ( japan slc ltd , hamamatsu , japan ) were used . \n shin'iseihaito consists of 3.0  g ( daily dose for human ) of gypsum fibrosum (  sh go ) , 3.0  g of tuber of ophiopogon japonicus (  mi mn dng ) , 1.5  g of root of scutellaria baicalensis (  hung qn ) , 1.5  g of rhizome of anemarrhena asphodeloides (  zh m ) , 0.75  g of fruit of gardenia jasminoides (  zh z ) , 1.5  g of bulb of lilium lancifolium (  bi h ) , 1.5  g of flower of magnolia salicifolia (  xn y ) , 0.5  g of leaf of eriobotrya japonica (  p p y ) , 0.75  g of rhizome of cimicifuga heracleifolia (  shng m ) . \n these crude drugs were boiled , filtered , and the decoction was dried to yield powdered extract ( ssht , 2.5  g for daily human dose ) . \n ssht ( lot : 14b019 ) was provided as a generous gift from the kobayashi pharmaceutical co. , ltd ( osaka , japan ) . \n ssht was suspended in distilled water to prepare the stock solution at a concentration of 0.1  g / ml and kept in  20  c until use . \n allergic murine models were established based on the previously described methods with minor modifications.7 , 8 the experimental timetable is provided in fig . \n 1 . mice were intraperitoneally administered 0.1  mg / ml ova ( sigma  aldrich , st . louis , mo , usa ) and 40  mg / ml al(oh3 ) in saline at a dosage of 100  l / mouse . \n sensitization was repeated twice ( days 0 and 7 ) , followed by daily injections of ova solution ( 15  mg / ml in saline , 10  l / each nostril ) into nostrils from day 1428 ( challenge ) . in the ssht - treated group , mice were force - fed ssht ( 10  mg/0.1  ml/10  g body weight ( bw)/day , 20-fold of human dosage ) from day 1328 . \n mice in the control group were given an equal volume of saline and were infected using the same method . at the end of animal experiment , \n all animal procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at nagoya city university , japan . \n blood samples from the allergic murine model were collected after 2  h of the last challenge on day 28 . \n the number of leukocyte and eosinophilia were measured in tohkai cytopathology institute ( gifu , japan ) . \n concentrations of serum total ige , il-4 , and ifn- were evaluated using mouse ige elisa , mouse il-4 , and mouse ifn- elisa kit ( biolegend inc . \n san diego , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , respectively . \n cytokine levels were calculated using standard murine recombinant cytokine curves run on the same immunoplate . \n the untreated female 6 week - old balb / c mice were injected intradermally with 10  l aliquot of 50 fold diluted anti - ova of serum in saline into shaved dorsal skin sites . \n after two days , ova ( 0.1  mg ) with 0.5% evans blue ( wako pure chemicals , osaka , japan ) in saline was injected intravenously into the tail vein . \n one hour after antigen challenge , mice were euthanized and the dorsal skin of the mouse was removed to measure the pigment area . \n the area of blue spots on the internal surface of the skin was measured.10 , 11 statistical analysis was performed by repeated one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) and the tukey / bonferroni / dunnett 's multiple comparison test . \n a probability value ( p  <  0.05 ) was considered to be statistically significant . \n the leukocyte levels were significantly higher in allergic mice than those in untreated mice , but those levels were not significantly changed by ssht - treatment [ fig . \n the eosinophilia levels were significantly higher in allergic mice than those in untreated mice . compared to allergic mice , \n the allergic rhinitis mice treated with ssht had significantly decreased eosinophil levels ( p  <  0.01 ) [ fig . \n the ige levels were higher in allergic mice than those in untreated mice . compared to allergic mice , \n the il-4 levels were significantly higher in allergic mice than those in untreated mice . compared to allergic mice , \n the allergic mice treated with ssht had also significantly decreased il-4 levels ( p  <  0.01 ) [ fig . \n the ifn- levels were significantly lower in allergic mice than those in untreated mice . compared to allergic mice , \n the allergic mice treated with ssht had also significantly increased ifn- levels ( p  <  0.01 ) [ fig . \n 3c ] . as we found that the eosinophilia and cytokine level of allergic mouse treated with ssht were remarkably decreased \n the sera containing ova - specific anaphylactic antibodies were intradermally injected and the pca reaction was measured 1  h after the injection of the evans blue solution containing ova . \n we observed that pca reactions using the sera of allergic mice were exhibited as blue spots . \n however , the average sizes of blue spots were significantly decreased in the sera of ssht - treated allergic mice compared to those in the sera of allergic mice . \n in the present study , we showed that the administration of shin'iseihaito ( ssht ; magnolia flower lung - clearing decoction ;  xn y qng fi tng ) is capable of suppressing the ige and il-4 levels in murine allergic reaction induced by nasal sensitization . \n thus , our result showed that ssht may return the decreased ifn-/il-4 ( th1/th2 ) ratio of the allergic group to the normal range . \n this result may also explain the reasons why the administration of ssht suppressed the production of anti - ova ige antibody without affecting the development of cd4 t cells , since il-4 is the cytokine known to induce immunoglobulin class switching to ige . \n il-4 is known to serve not only as a mast cell growth factor but also as the major mast cell chemoattachment . \n therefore , it is possible that the decrease of th2 responses in nasal mucosa modulated the mast cell ( ige)-mediated nasal symptoms , in concert with the decreased production of anti - ova ige antibody . \n our result of pca reaction also demonstrated that ssht inhibited the anaphylaxic factors such as ige and other antigens . \n the precise mechanism of the effect of ssht on pca reaction is to be determined in a future study . although our results demonstrate that ssht had anti - inflammatory effect , each individual component of ssht also shows anti - inflammatory effect . \n especially , the flower of m. salicifolia (  xn y ) has several anti - inflammatory effects including the inhibitory effects of mast cell - derived histamine release and pca reaction.14 , 15 , 16 , 17 the fruit of g. jasminoides (  zh z ) inhibits the histamine release from mast cells and lowered the serum level of ige and histamine in allergic murine model . \n the rhizome of a. asphodeloides (  zh m ) inhibits nf-b transcription activity via the p38 mapk and erk pathway . \n the leaf of e. japonica (  p p y ) had anti - inflammatory effect with attenuation of p38map kinase and erk . \n some researcher reported that the root of s. baicalensis (  hung qn ) , the bulb of l. lancifolium (  bi h ) , and the tuber of o. japonicus (  mi mn dng ) had anti - inflammatory activity.21 , 22 , 23 although each component has anti - inflammation effect , this mechanism in detail has been unknown . \n japanese traditional kampo medicine (  r bn hn y ) is generally composed of several components and the interaction of them may enhance the effect of drugs . as further investigation from this perspective is needed , ssht may have pronounced anti - inflammatory effects . \n administration of shin'iseihaito ( ssht ; magnolia flower lung - clearing decoction ;  xn y qng fi tng ) is capable of improving allergic status in ova - induced allergic murine model . \n further studies are required to confirm the anti - allergy effects and elucidate the mechanisms of anti - allergy action of ssht in allergic murine model . \n ",

      "document": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research \nand Awareness Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious \n        inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.\n            (2) Crohn's disease may occur in any section of the \n        gastrointestinal tract but is predominately found in the lower \n        part of the small intestine and the large intestine. Ulcerative \n        colitis is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the \n        innermost lining of the colon. Complete removal of the colon in \n        patients with ulcerative colitis can potentially alleviate and \n        cure symptoms.\n            (3) Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis behave \n        similarly, they are collectively known as inflammatory bowel \n        disease. Both diseases present a variety of symptoms, including \n        severe diarrhea, abdominal pain with cramps, fever, arthritic \n        joint pain, inflammation of the eye, and rectal bleeding. There \n        is no known cause of inflammatory bowel disease, or medical \n        cure.\n            (4) It is estimated that up to 1,400,000 people in the \n        United States suffer from inflammatory bowel disease, 30 \n        percent of whom are diagnosed during their childhood years.\n            (5) Children with inflammatory bowel disease miss school \n        activities because of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, and \n        many adults who had onset of inflammatory bowel disease as \n        children had delayed puberty and impaired growth and have never \n        reached their full genetic growth potential.\n            (6) Inflammatory bowel disease patients are at high risk \n        for developing colorectal cancer.\n            (7) The total annual medical costs for inflammatory bowel \n        disease patients are estimated at more than $2,000,000,000.\n            (8) The average time from presentation of symptoms to \n        diagnosis in children is 3 years.\n            (9) Delayed diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease \n        frequently results in more-active disease associated with \n        increased morbidity and complications.\n            (10) Congress has appropriated $3,480,000 from fiscal year \n        2005 to fiscal year 2009 for epidemiology research on \n        inflammatory bowel disease through the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention.\n            (11) The National Institutes of Health National Commission \n        on Digestive Diseases issued comprehensive research goals \n        related to inflammatory bowel disease in its April 2009 report \n        to Congress and the American public entitled; ``Opportunities \n        and Challenges in Digestive Diseases Research: Recommendations \n        of the National Commission on Digestive Diseases''.\n\nSEC. 3.

      "document": "the truth is that most medical breakthroughs have ultimately come from basic research , and i think that we as scientists need to do a better job of telling these success stories . \n my favorite example is that antibiotics came out of finding a random contaminant on a plate . and remember that we have crispr [ clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ] tools only because people were studying some bizarro antipathogen mechanism in bacteria . \n it s a beautiful example of something entirely unanticipated coming out of left field . that s why it s important to maintain funding for a very diverse program of basic research ; history tells us you ca nt predict where the next advance will come from . \n right now it seems like funding agencies and the public have an engineering mentality , and they believe that , as long as we think hard enough about a problem , we can solve it . \n that s an admirable attitude , but in the life sciences it s not always the right path to discovery . \n i would argue that under some circumstances , studying yeast cells is a better idea than studying highly transformed human cells in a dish . \n for many years , we used to write in the  significance  section of grant applications that the reason that it is important to understand chromosome segregation is because , when it fails , cells become aneuploid and cancerous . \n why should aneuploidy cause cells to proliferate ? when you do yeast crosses and by chance get an aneuploid strain , invariably the cells do poorly . and \n one explanation is that building an organism is a complicated procedure , so if you change the gene dosage of certain genes , you mess everything up . that s probably true \n you could then further argue that , at the cellular level , maybe it does nt really matter how many chromosomes you have , as long as you have at least one of each . \n perhaps extra chromosomes are actually good for an individual cell and allow it to keep proliferating when they should not and this gives you cancer . \n however , we never thought this was very likely , given that aneuploid yeast often proliferate poorly . \n you can very agnostically ask : what happens to a cell if you change the chromosome number ? \n yeast was the right organism for this because we have genetic tricks and selection methods to generate aneuploids that are stable enough to study . \n because this allowed us to examine many different types of aneuploidies at the same time , we could look for broad patterns \n . we could nt have done it in any other organism . actually , we do all our discovery work in yeast . and when we find something interesting , we move it into the mouse or human cell lines and ask whether we see the same thing . \n sometimes the answer is  no ,  but more often the answer is  yes . \n it s just harder to discover fundamentally new things in very complex organisms where the repertoire of tools is limited . \n and i would argue that , under some circumstances , studying yeast cells is a better idea than studying highly transformed human cells in a dish . \n angelika amon s work over the past 15 years has guided all of us who think about mitotic and meiotic cell division . \n , we wondered whether there was a systematic way the cell avoids losing or gaining chromosomes . to be honest \n , i was hoping there would be some kind of cute mechanism that counts chromosomes . that turned out to be completely wrong . or at least we havent been able to find anything of this sort . \n once we realized that , we had to step back and let the genetics lead the way . \n we did a lot of phenotypic characterization and then developed hypotheses to explain the patterns we saw . \n if complex subunits are not expressed in the correct ratios , often unassembled subunits need chaperones to maintain their soluble state and eventually need to be degraded if they can not find a binding partner . \n cancer cells do nt only lose or gain whole chromosomes , they also have translocations and deletions and point mutations . we know that making and repairing dna requires a lot of nifty multi - subunit complexes , \n so our hypothesis was that whole - chromosome abnormalities cause stoichiometric imbalances in these complexes and this leads to defects in their formation and function . \n so we re testing the idea that aneuploidy contributes to cancer because it s a mutator , rather than because it s a promoter of growth and proliferation , and we re doing more and more mouse work to answer those kinds of questions . \n but we still use yeast to discover new properties of aneuploidy and to look at the cellular effects of changing the dosage of specific genes . \n we started a new project on mitochondria a few years ago that i m really excited about . \n one big question is : how did these two organisms start talking to each other ? did one learn english or the other learn french ? or did they resort to a more primitive sign language  metabolites  to talk to each other ? \n the other thing i m fascinated by is that a large fraction of uncharacterized yeast genes localize to mitochondria . \n that tells you there s a lot of biology in the mitochondria still to be learned . \n what i think is even more important is that many of these genes are not at all conserved , not even in fungi . \n so here are all these very new , very fast - evolving genes and nobody knows what they do ! \n usually when people hear that a gene is not conserved , they run !  arrgh ! \n it s something yeast specific !  but in this particular instance i think it s important and suggests mitochondria are still battling it out with the nucleus . \n one way to look at it is to say the nucleus and mitochondria are not really symbiotic . \n if mitochondria do nt get anything out of the relationship , they are really just slaves to the nucleus . \n so the mitochondria are trying to escape the reign of the nucleus and the nucleus is fighting back in an arms race . and \n if we can understand what all these nonconserved mitochondrial genes are doing , we can begin to find the frictions that still exist between the interests of the nucleus and the mitochondria . \n i m totally fascinated by understanding how these different entities interact with each other inside a single cell .",

      "document": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This bill may be cited as the ``Freedom to Fish Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Recreational fishing is traditionally one of the most \n        popular outdoor sports with more than 45 million participants \n        of all ages, in all regions of the country.\n            (2) Recreational fishing makes substantial contributions to \n        the local, State, and national economies. According to the most \n        recent economic figures, recreational fishing infuses $108 \n        billion annually into the national economy. Nationally, over \n        1.2 million jobs are related to recreational fishing; this \n        represents approximately 1 percent of the nation's entire \n        civilian work force. For those communities and small businesses \n        that rely on seasonal tourism, the expenditures of recreational \n        fishers result in substantial benefits to the local economies.\n            (3) Recreational fishers have long demonstrated a \n        conservation ethic. Through catch-and-release fisheries and \n        through the use of non-lethal fishing gear. In addition to \n        payment of Federal excise taxes on fishing equipment, \n        motorboats and fuel, as well as license fees, recreational \n        fishers contribute over $500 million annually to State \n        fisheries conservation management programs and projects.\n            (4) The single most important element of recreational \n        fishing is open access to places to fish. The open access \n        principle is universally accepted on all Federal lands and \n        waters including wildlife refuges, national parks, wilderness \n        areas, and the exclusive economic zone.\n            (5) All recreational fishery resources can be maintained \n        through a variety of management measures including take limits, \n        minimum size requirements, and closed seasons without \n        unnecessarily restricting public access to places to fish.\n            (6) The absence of clear Congressional policy has confused \n        the general public as to how programs within the National \n        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration complement one another \n        with respect to recreational fishing.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the Congress in this Act--\n            (1) to ensure that all Federal regulations promote open \n        access for recreational fishing to the maximum extent \n        practicable;\n            (2) to ensure that recreational fishers will be actively \n        involved in any regulatory procedures that contemplate \n        restrictions on their access to places to fish; and\n            (3) to ensure that whenever access to fishing places is \n        restricted, that the restricted areas be as small as are \n        scientifically necessary to provide for the conservation of the \n        fishery resource.\n\nSEC. 4. MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT \n              AMENDMENT.\n\n    Section 303(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act (16 U.S.C. 1853(a)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``and'' after the semicolon in paragraph \n        (13);\n            (2) by striking ``fishery.'' in paragraph (14) and \n        inserting ``fishery; and''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(15) not establish areas closed to recreational fishing \n        unless--\n                    ``(A) there is a clear indication that recreational \n                fishermen are the cause of a specific conservation \n                problem and that less severe conservation measures, \n                such as gear restrictions, quotas, or closed seasons \n                will not adequately provide for conservation and \n                management of the affected stocks of fish;\n                    ``(B) the closed area regulation includes specific \n                measurable criteria to determine the conservation \n                benefit of the closed area on the affected stocks of \n                fish and provides a timetable for periodic review of \n                the continued need for the closed area at least once \n                every three years;\n                    ``(C) the closed area is no larger than that which \n                is supported by the best available scientific \n                information; or\n                    ``(D) provision is made to reopen the closed area \n                to recreational fishing whenever the condition in \n                subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) that was the basis of the \n                closure no longer exists.''.\n\nSEC. 5.

      "document": "heart transplantation continues to provide patients with end - stage heart disease with extended survival with a half - life of 9.3 years between 2000 and june 2008 . . \n however , despite substantial advancements in immunosuppression , patients continue to be at significant risk for allograft rejection early after cardiac transplantation . \n the two recognized forms of allograft rejection are acute cellular rejection and antibody - mediated rejection ( amr ) . \n while acute cellular rejection has historically been the most common cause of allograft dysfunction , amr has only recently become widely accepted . during the 2004 international society of heart and lung transplantation ( ishlt ) , \n cellular rejection grades were revised and amr was formally defined . in april 2010 , a publication from the ishlt consensus conference assessed the status of amr in heart transplantation and a pathologic grading scale was devised . despite the advent of new technology , such as gene expression profiling and echocardiograms , endomyocardial biopsy remains the standard for detecting rejection . to minimize the risk of a false negative , multiple specimens ( usually 35 ) are obtained from 3 different sites . though rare \n , false negatives do exist either through sampling error , artifact , quilty lesions , or pathology misread . \n prior to the 2010 consensus conference , hemodynamic compromise , in the absence of acute cellular rejection , was termed biopsy - negative rejection . \n although the prevalence of the so - called biopsy - negative rejection has declined with the clinical diagnosis of amr , there are incidences of patients who present with cardiac dysfunction ( left ventricular ejection fraction , lvef  45% ) but have no biopsy findings of cellular or antibody - mediated rejection . \n since the outcome of patients with bnr ( which includes cardiac dysfunction ) has not been well established , we sought to review the characteristics and treatment response of patients who have developed bnr after heart transplantation . \n we retrospectively reviewed our cohort of patients who underwent heart transplantation between 2002 and 2012 and found 12 cases of bnr in 11 heart transplant patients , as defined by patients presenting with cardiac dysfunction , characterized by lvef  45% , and who had no biopsy findings of cellular rejection or amr . \n as severe infections are also known to cause left ventricular dysfunction , patients with a clear clinical picture of sepsis with fever , increase in white blood count , or positive cultures were excluded . \n continuous variable was presented as mean  standard deviation while categorical variable is presented as percentages . \n we identified 11 patients who underwent heart transplantation between 2002 and 2012 and were treated for bnr . \n none of the bnr patients had previous blood transfusion or previous transplant . 5 ( 45% ) patients had a previous vad placement and 1 ( 9% ) patient was african american . \n the baseline immunosuppression medications are as follows : 5 patients ( 45% ) underwent induction therapy with antithymocyte globulin ( atg ) , 9 patients ( 82% ) initiated with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil , 1 patient ( 9% ) initiated with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil , and 1 patient ( 9% ) initiated with cyclosporine and azathioprine . \n 2 patients switched to cyclosporine from tacrolimus because of reduced seizure threshold ; 1 patient switched to a renal sparing protocol of sirolimus with mycophenolate mofetil because of renal function concerns . \n the 12 cases of bnr presented with an average lvef of 34%  10% and 11 ( 92% ) treated cases occurred during the first - year after transplant ( table 3 ) . \n the mean time to the first incidence of bnr is 7.8  7.5 months and no patient had treated rejection before onset of bnr except for the patient at the second onset . among the 106 biopsies that have been done before bnr , 24 ( 23% ) demonstrated low grade acute cellular rejection ( 1r , 1a , or 1b ) and 1 ( 0.9% ) showed suspicious antibody - mediated rejection ( amr 1 ) . de novo circulating antibodies developed in 3 cases ( in 3 patients ) and 1 of them had donor - specific antibodies . 4 out of the 12 cases presented with lvef  35% and presented with heart failure symptoms . of these 4 heart failure cases , \n 2 required inotropic support  both received intravenous ( iv ) methylprednisolone ( 500  mg1000  mg per day for 3 days ) , atg ( 125150  mg per day for 35 days ) , and iv immunoglobulin ( ivig , 70  g per day for 3 days ) , followed by oral corticosteroids ( prednisone 80100  mg per day bolus and taper ) . \n for the remaining 2 patients who presented with heart failure symptoms but did not necessitate inotropes , 1 was treated with atg and iv methylprednisolone followed by prednisone bolus and taper and the other was given iv methylprednisolone followed by prednisone only . \n for the 8 out of 12 cases without heart failure symptoms , 7 were treated with only high dose oral corticosteroids . \n overall , 7 cases ( 58% ) ( in 7 patients ) favorably resulted with return to normal left ventricular function ( lvef of 57%  6% ) within a mean of 14  10 days from the initial negative biopsy . \n of these 7 patients , one expired approximately 6 months after the date of the normalized lvef and another one expired approximately 4 months after the date of normalized lvef . the remaining 5 cases ( in 5 patients , including 1 patient 's second case of bnr ) maintained persistent left ventricular dysfunction beyond 90 days . \n a flow chart of treatment and effect could be found in figure 1 . in summary , \n the lvef status at 90 days is as follows : 5 cases ( in 5 patients , including 1 case as second bnr on a patient ) had persistent lv dysfunction , and 7 cases ( in 7 patients ) experienced normalized lvef . \n as our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying cardiac allograft rejection increases , the number of undiagnosed rejection decreases . the concept of bnr has evolved from its initial definition as hemodynamic compromise in the absence of acute cellular rejection to its current definition of patients presenting with cardiac dysfunction in the absence of biopsy findings of cellular rejection or amr . \n amr has changed from being suggested as bnr to its own ishlt biopsy grading scale . however , even though the majority of rejection episodes of unclear etiology have now been resolved to be cases of amr , there are still cases where the biopsy findings are inconsistent with the clinical prognosis , that is , patients with a decrease in lvef with no biopsy findings of rejection , cellular , or humoral . due to the inconsistencies of endomyocardial biopsies , the existence of bnr is questioned . \n this argument is furthered by the fact that prior to the 2010 amr consensus conference , 1020% of cardiac allograft recipients were diagnosed with bnr when in actuality the majority of patients most likely experienced amr . \n this brings up the question of whether bnr should exist as a separate category of rejection or is merely a by - product of the problems inherent with endomyocardial biopsies . in one case study , \n sampling error or nonuniformity of histopathologic changes resulted in a false - negative biopsy . in this case study , \n a heart transplant recipient with repeatedly unremarkable endomyocardial biopsies and a negative evaluation for humoral rejection was found to have severe subepicardial myocyte necrosis with classic cellular rejection in the subsequent autopsy . \n this is contrary to other studies which have found that rejection is evenly distributed throughout the right ventricular endomyocardium . \n although endomyocardial biopsy is the primary resource to diagnose acute rejections in all the cases discussed in this study , there are a few noninvasive diagnostics that have been demonstrated to be helpful in diagnosing acute allograft rejection after heart transplantation . in one multicenter clinical trial , pham et al . \n reported that using gene - expression profiling to monitor rejection for patients 6 months after heart transplantation was not associated with increased risk of serious adverse outcomes and could reduce the need for biopsy . in two pilot studies , wu et al . \n applied cardiac magnetic resonance ( cmr ) in vivo to detect immune - cell infiltration at sites of rejection by monitoring macrophages . \n the investigators subsequently developed a functional index from local strain analysis and proved it to be correlated with rejection grades [ 8 , 9 ] . \n although clinical applications have not been implemented , cmr was demonstrated to be capable of providing the rejection status of whole - heart perspective , and thus might be a potential tool of optimizing diagnosis of bnr . \n another potential tool is speckle - tracking 2-dimensional strain echocardiography ( 2dse ) . by using rat cardiac transplantation models , pieper et al \n . demonstrated that 2dse was able to differentiate myocardial function between rejection in allografts and nonrejection in isografts . \n perhaps bnr is another form of amr but due to the  newness  of amr and the lack of a complete understanding of amr , no definite conclusions can be made . despite the ishlt revised biopsy rejection scale , \n this revised definition of bnr has been noted to result in a decrease in 3-year subsequent survival , lower subsequent freedom from cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( cav ) , and a decrease in freedom from nonfatal major adverse cardiac events ( nf - mace ) . \n previous studies characterized bnr as occurring on average 43  38 months following transplantation while the data collected in our study indicates that the time to the first incidence of bnr is 7.8  7.5 months . the mechanism associated with bnr \n unfortunately not too many reports in the field looked at the treatment protocols for bnr . in our single center experience , who patients presented with heart failure symptoms \n were given more aggressive treatment , that is , atg , iv methylprednisolone , and ivig while patients without heart failure symptoms were mostly given prednisone bolus and taper only . as bnr is an infrequent phenomenon , of which there is considerable debate regarding its validity , further work needs to be instigated on whether there is a correlation between different factors and bnr episodes . \n overall , from this set of data , it is inconclusive as to whether or not there are any characteristics of bnr that differs from other types of rejections . \n a point of interest in this study is the patient who experienced two episodes of bnr . due to the small sample size , it is uncertain whether having one episode of bnr increases the risk of recurrent bnr episodes . during the first bnr episode , \n in contrast , it took the patient 6 months to experience a return to normalized lvef ( 51% ) during the second bnr episode . \n for the first episode of bnr , there was a favorable return to normal cardiac function following treatment with oral corticosteroids bolus and taper . \n in the case of the second episode of bnr , ivig was given instead which led to an increase in lvef , although it took a longer time ( 6 months ) for the patient to experience a return to the range of normalized lvef . \n prior to experiencing normalized lvef the patient 's lvef remained in the 40% range , fluctuating between 43% and 48% . \n the repeat bnr patient was the only african americans in this study and did not experience normalized lvef at 90-day after second onset . \n african americans have been reported to have a higher risk of rejection after transplant compared to any other race due to their unique metabolism in regard to immunosuppression [ 14 , 15 ] . \n a possible immunosuppression regimen with respect to bnr could require more aggressive treatment , employing the use of atg and ivig in addition to steroids . \n potential cause for this second onset of bnr could be the combined factor of this patient not receiving an adequate treatment for the second bnr and the ethnicity of the patient . as cases of bnr tend to respond favorably to appropriate rejection therapy 2 ( 17% ) of 12 bnr cases required inotropes and 7 ( 58% ) bnr cases without heart failure symptoms were treated with oral steroid bolus and taper . \n seven of 12 ( 58% ) treated bnr cases resulted in a return to a normal lvef of 57%  6% within a mean of 14  10 days from the initial negative biopsy . due to the small sample size , it is uncertain whether bnr should be considered as a new category in the biopsy grading scale or if it is merely difficult to diagnose based on endomyocardial biopsies alone . if it is the former , then mechanism needs to be elucidated . \n if it is the latter , then perhaps other methods for detecting rejection need to be considered . \n bnr is a rare phenomenon ( 12 cases of bnr in a 10-year period ) and can be a severe form of rejection in that there is cardiac dysfunction . \n however , this type of rejection is not apparent on biopsies due to either lack of knowledge regarding further types of rejection or other factors . characteristics of these cases of rejection are described above with most cases responding favorablly to rejection therapy .",

      "document": "a 21-month - old male patient , 75 cm in height and 10 kg in weight , experienced tricuspid valve regurgitation ( tvr ) and was scheduled to undergo tricuspid valve plasty . the tvr was discovered in a follow - up test 1 year after he had undergone ventricular septal defect repair surgery . before tricuspid valve plasty \n , a tee was performed , which showed a level 3 - 4 tvr and severe right ventricular hypertrophy . \n atropine , thiopental sodium , and vecuronium were administered to induce anesthesia and muscle relaxation . \n a catheter was placed at the left radial artery to measure the constant blood pressure and analyze the abga ( table 1 ) . \n there were complications due to the adhesion of the svc and ivc near the surgical site . \n therefore , a 20 fr and 22 fr cannula was placed on them , respectively . 2 u of packed red blood cells ( prc ) , albumin , and mannitol was used as the priming solution . immediately after activating the cardiopulmonary bypass , the measured hematocrit level was 27.5% . \n the acid - base balance management mid - surgery was performed with an -stat . during extracorporeal circulation , \n the body temperature was aimed at a moderately low degree of 25. the perfusion rate was kept at 0.5 - 1.0 l / min . \n after tricuspid valve surgery , the patient was weaned from the cardiopulmonary bypass by reducing the perfusion rate of the machine and starting mechanical ventilation . \n the total anesthesia , surgery and extracorporeal circulation time was 510 minutes , 420 minutes and 180 minutes , respectively . \n the amount of blood loss was estimated to be 800 ml . during surgery , 600 ml of a crystalloid solution , 3 u prc and 2 u platelets were administered . \n however the patient 's eyes could not focus , and his upper and lower limbs experienced intermittent convulsions . \n brain computed tomography revealed findings indicative of a cerebral infarction in the occipital lobe ( fig . \n eeg was performed , which showed no abnormal findings of alpha rhythm loss , which is customary in cortical blindness . \n phenobarbital was administered until 19 days after surgery under the suspicion of a connection between the ocular deviation and the convulsions . \n the convulsions did not return , but the reaction to light or objects in front of the eyes did not trigger an avoidance response from the patient . \n there were no hopeful clinical signs of a visual recovery but fundoscopy showed normal findings . \n on the postoperative day 28 , when the flash visual evoked potential ( fvep ) and mri had been planned , the patient 's eyes refocused . \n he was able to recognize the objects in front of his eyes , could walk and avoid things in his path , and was able to recognize his guardians . \n post surgery visual loss or reduction can be caused by a variety of factors , and occurs 0.1% to 1% of cases . \n visual loss is caused by damage to any connecting striate area between the cornea and occipital cortex . \n direct pressure on the eyeball , indirect increase in ocular tension due to improper positioning and blood vessel damage can cause central retinal artery occlusion or ischemic optic nerve damage , which can lead to visual loss . in addition , a severe decrease in blood pressure , emboli , and thrombus mid- or post - surgery can cause an infarction in the occipital cortex , which can lead to cortical blindness . \n visual loss after a cpb might be caused primarily due to emboli , severe low blood pressure , acute anemia , hypoxia or a combination of these factors . in the present case \n twenty seven cases were cortical blindness , of which 22 cases occurred after cardiac surgery ( 81% ) . \n aldrich et al .   reported a retrospective study of 25 patients , where the causes of cortical blindness were natural ischemic stroke in 8 patients ( 32% ) , cardiac surgery in 5 patients ( 20% ) , cerebral angiography in 3 patients ( 12% ) , non - surgery in 4 patients ( 16% ) , seizure in 2 patients ( 8% ) , and other factors , such as damage to the head and peritoneal dialysis , in 3 patients ( 12% ) . \n there were also cases of temporary cortical blindness reported after post - cardiac surgery angiography . in the case of children , \n the early indicators of brain damage after surgery are age , the complexity of surgery , metabolic acidosis , increase in lactate , and artery acidosis . diagnosing cortical blindness is simple when the patient makes a complaint but as in our case , a pediatric patient has limited ability to communicate . therefore , conducting an eeg , fvep , angiography , and funduscopy can assist in making a diagnosis . in this case , the eeg did not show the abnormal finding of a loss in alpha rhythm . however , computed laminography revealed an infarction in the occipital cortex \n we checked for visual loss with light and objects to test the patient 's avoidance response but he did not respond properly . \n however , microemboli caused by extracorporeal circulation can obstruct the blood flow in the cerebral vessels , particularly in the watershed area . \n braekken et al .   reported that cardiac surgery using extracorporeal circulation causes microemboli in most cases . \n in addition , in patients with neural damage , there are more cases of transcranial doppler detection of microembolic signals in the right middle cerebral artery than in patients without . \n microemboli mid - surgery occurs most often when blocking the aorta ( 18% ) and unblocking the aorta ( 13% ) . \n rodriguez and belway   stated that in pediatric cardiac surgery , the likelihood of microemboli can increase with increasing time of extracorporeal circulation depending on the oxygenator , circuit , adnexa parts , and components . \n the surgery in this case was not complicated , but may have increased the likelihood of microembolization due to the long extracorporeal circulation time . \n however , we should have been more careful in the selecting the -stat and ph - stat method . \n nevertheless , the strength of the ph - stat should have been considered regarding neural sequelae . \n the cpb priming solution in pediatric patients , unlike adults , can cause blood thinning , which can lead to possible ischemic organ failure . \n aldrich et al .   reported that conditions , such as the age below 40 , no diabetes or high blood pressure , and no impairment in cognitive skills , language skills or memory , indicate a good prognosis for visual recovery . \n in addition , eeg tests can assist in a diagnosis but are not helpful in accurately predicting the prognosis . in this study , \n two weeks after the surgery , he recovered his speech and cognitive skills , so we did expected a good prognosis . \n the patient 's vision recovered rapidly from postoperative day 28 and he could be discharged . \n other tests such as a fvep were not performed , so the precise extent of the recovery rate is unknown . \n considerable effort is required to reduce neural sequelae after pediatric cardiac surgery , such as visual loss . \n the cpb machine 's circuit components and type choice should be made on what can best prevent the likelihood of emboli . \n a pediatric transesophageal scan and cerebral oxymeter can help in the early identification of neural side - effects . \n a transesophageal scan plays an important role in eliminating emboli , so it should be prepared for all suitable pediatric patients . \n the pathological difference between an adult and pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass should be recognized , and proper measures should be followed . \n when cortical blindness is suspected , the ophthalmologist and neurologist should perform a combined examination , being cautious of permanent sequelae . in conclusion , with the reported visual loss in our pediatric patient , surgeons should consider the possibility of visual loss and cerebrovascular injury after a cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass .",
      "summary": "visual loss occurring after pediatric cardiac surgery employing cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) is relatively rare but the risk is substantial . \n compromised cerebral perfusion due to a cpb related micro - embolization and inflammatory vascular changes as well as reduced oxygen carrying capacity in hemodilution and hypothermia during cpb might be major contributing factors to the development of postoperative visual loss after cardiac surgery with cpb . \n a case of immediate but transient postoperative visual loss was encountered in a 21-month - old male who underwent tricuspid valve surgery . despite routine intraoperative measures to maintain an adequate perfusion pressure throughout the procedure , postoperative computed tomography revealed a subacute infarct in his occipital lobe . \n recovery began on postoperative day 28 , and the patient 's vision was restored by 31 days .",

induced white finger , and oral cancer [ 20 , 21 ] . \n the relationship between saliva and plasma et-2 and et-3 isoforms is comparatively less well understood . because of the emerging significance of all three isoforms in health and disease , notably the role of et-2 in the cardiovascular system , in ovulation , immunology , and cancer , we sought to extend the data on the relationships between the three endothelin isoforms in concurrent saliva and plasma samples . \n ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) , trifluoroacetic acid ( tfa ) , phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride ( pmsf ) , 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin , molecular weight cut - off filters ( 30  kda ) , endothelin-1 ( et-1 , human ) , endothelin-2 ( et-2 , human ) , and endothelin-3 ( et-3 , human ) were obtained from sigma aldrich ( oakville , ontario ) . \n big endothelin-1 ( bet-1 , human ) was obtained from bachem bioscience ( american inc . , \n acetonitrile , acetone , methanol , and hydrochloric acid were purchased from sigma aldrich ( oakville , ontario ) . \n amber glass vials and screwcaps with septa were purchased from chromatographic specialities ( brockville , ontario ) . \n deionized water was obtained from a super - q plus high purity water system ( millipore corporation , bedford , ma ) . \n compressed gaseous nitrogen was of uhp grade quality and was supplied by matheson gas products ( whitby , ontario ) . \n anonymous , paired human plasma and saliva samples ( from males ) certified free of hiv , hep - a , and hep - b were purchased commercially ( innovative research inc . \n both plasma and saliva samples were treated on site with pmsf ( final , 1.7  mg / ml ) and edta ( final , 10  mg / ml ) to stabilize endothelins , shipped to our laboratory in dry ice , and stored at 80c until further use . \n thirty ( 30 ) sample pairs of good quality and in sufficient amounts for analysis were retained for this study . \n briefly , plasma ( 250  l ) and saliva ( 1  ml ) samples were treated with ice - cold 3,4-dichloroisocumarin solution in isopropanol to prevent conversion of bet-1 to et-1 during the sample processing . \n the samples were deproteinized with ice - cold acid - acetone mix ( acetone  :  1  n hcl  :  water , 40  :  1  :  5 ) and centrifuged at 9000  g for 10  min , and the supernatants obtained were concentrated by evaporation under nitrogen flow . deproteinization and concentration stages were repeated once more to ensure the removal of abundant proteins . \n samples were then loaded onto 30  kda molecular weight cut - off filters ( prewashed with deionised water ) and centrifuged at 5000  g for 30  min . \n these filters were then washed with 50% methanol and centrifuged at 5000  g for 30  min . \n filtrates were dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in 75  l of 30% acetonitrile in 0.2% tfa / h2o for hplc - fluorescence analysis . \n the hplc unit consisted of a gilson solvent delivery system ( mandel scientific , guelph , on ) , a gilson autosampler ( model 231 xl ; middleton , wi ) , a supelcosil lc-318 reverse - phase column ( 25  cm length , 4.6  mm i d , 5  m particle size , and 300   pore dimension ; supelco , oakville , on ) , and a rf 551 model fluorescence detector ( shimadzu , japan ) . \n endothelins ( 20  l injection volume ) were separated using a gradient elution with acetonitrile / water mobile phase at a flow rate of 1  ml / min and detected at ex 280  nm and em 340  nm . \n blanks were analyzed after each set of four samples in order to assess the extent of analyte carryover . \n student 's t - test or mann - whitney rank sum test was carried out as appropriate using sigmastat v 11.0 ( spss inc . , \n correlation between different endothelin isoforms in plasma and saliva was tested using pearson 's product moment correlation revealing p and r values . \n we used hplc - fluorescence to measure simultaneously the isoforms bet-1 , et-1 , et-2 , and et-3 ( figures 1(a)-1(b ) ) in time - matched plasma and saliva sample pairs ( n = 30 ) obtained from anonymous individuals ( table 1 ) . \n our results confirm and extend previous reports of the presence of endothelins in saliva [ 15 , 16 ] and of a relationship between saliva and circulating endothelins [ 1719 ] , and the correlated measurements provide additional insight into the relationship of et-2 to the other two isoforms . \n the recoveries , analytical precision , and accuracy of the hplc - fluorescence procedure   are comparable to values reported by walczak et al . \n for hplc with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry detection : recoveries of endothelins from spiked plasma are between 60% ( et-2 ) and 97% ( et-1 ) , depending on the endothelin isoforms ; analytical precision is on the order of 4% for replicate peptide standards ; analytical accuracy is 20% for replicate measurements of plasma samples ; limit of detection is 0.20.5  pmol ; and linearity is 1100  pmol on the column ( 20  l injection volume ) . \n both methods detect the separated peptides directly ( i.e. , on the basis of autofluorescence of aromatic amino acids by hplc [ 23 , 25 ] or from mass ion fingerprints in ms / ms ) , which is different from elisa detection of immunoreactive endothelin in total plasma [ 26 , 27 ] . \n for this reason , we have verified identities of analytes by pulling down of et-1 and et-3 with monoclonal antibodies during sample processing , confirming the correspondence between immunoreactive endothelins in plasma and the peptides measured by direct autofluorescence detection after separation on column . \n it should be noted that the aim of our study was not to explore the physiological significance of variations of saliva and plasma endothelin levels , within and between individuals , and for this reason we have not requested any information on the health status , cardiovascular or buccal , of the donors . \n salivary secretions and saliva volume will be affected by water and food uptake and by medication . \n these factors , together with the health status of subjects and sample quality , can contribute to the variance in observed saliva endothelin concentrations and relationship to plasma levels . \n furthermore , sample collection procedures , sample preparation methods , matrix effects , and the analytical approach used are likely to impact the absolute values of estimates . finally , because all samples analyzed for endothelin content in our small study were from male donors , our data do not address potential gender differences . notwithstanding those limitations , \n our observations reveal that levels of all endothelin isoforms were significantly correlated between the saliva and plasma matrices in the subjects studied : bet-1 ( r = 0.38 , p = 0.041 ) , et-1 ( r = 0.53 , p = 0.003 ) , et-2 ( r = 0.51 , p = 0.004 ) , and et-3 ( r = 0.75 , p < 0.001 ) ( table 1 , figure 2 ) . \n our results indicate a slight increase in the ratios of endothelin levels in plasma versus saliva with age of the subjects ( et-1 , plasma / saliva ratio in 1840 years versus 4163 years , 6.11  2.16 versus 8.67  2.51 , p = 0.006 ) , which is potentially attributable to saliva osmolality changes with age [ 28 , 29 ] . \n endothelin levels varied on average by fivefold between individuals , and this applied to all four isoforms measured , in plasma as well as saliva ( 90th/10th percentiles ) . \n in general , high bet-1 and et-1 levels were predictive of high et-3 levels within an individual ( table 2 ) . within plasma , \n a significant positive correlation was seen for bet-1 versus et-1 ( r = 0.39 , p = 0.033 ) , bet-1 versus et-3 ( r = 0.46 , p = 0.011 ) , and et-1 versus et-3 ( r = 0.57 , p = 0.001 ) . within saliva , \n a significant positive correlation was seen for bet-1 versus et-1 ( r = 0.75 , p < 0.001 ) . \n correlations between bet-1 versus et-3 ( r = 0.31 , p = 0.091 ) and et-1 versus et-3 ( r = 0.27 , p = 0.144 ) in saliva were not significant . there were no significant correlations between et-2 and other isoforms in either plasma or saliva . \n whole saliva contains secretions from the major parotid , submandibular and sublingual glands , the palate , buccal and labial mucosa , and so on . \n expression of preproet-1 and preproet-3 as well as the eta and etb receptors has been detected by rt - pcr analyses of submandibular glands of rats . \n endothelin-1 has also been detected in striated duct cells of human salivary glands by immunohistochemical analysis . \n however , serum molecules that are not part of the normal salivary secretory constituents , such as proteins , drugs , and hormones , can also reach saliva by passive diffusion [ 1 , 2 , 3436 ] . \n we have measured six- to eightfold higher concentrations of endothelins in plasma by comparison to saliva , and hence the concentration gradient may result in diffusion of the peptides from the capillaries of the mucosa into the salivary fluid . if the intercept of the linear regressions of saliva versus plasma endothelin concentrations is taken as an estimate of the contribution by salivary glands , then at least half ( bet-1 , et-1 , and et-2 ) to two - thirds ( et-3 ) of the salivary endothelins may originate from plasma ( figure 2 ) . \n correlation among the different endothelin isoforms within individuals and the large variance of endothelin levels between individuals may be due to a number of factors , including common regulatory mechanisms , genetic polymorphisms , and physiological status . \n correlation between bet-1 and et-1 should be expected because of the direct precursor - product relationship . \n furthermore , endothelin converting enzyme-1 , which cleaves bet-1 to et-1 , shares some regulatory elements with the preproet-1 gene , such that when preproet-1 is transcriptionally activated , ece-1 tends to be activated as well . in healthy individuals , et-1 plays an important role in the modulation of vasomotor tone , in conjunction with nitric oxide , but also in regulating cellular proliferation and differentiation in tissues during growth , development , and repair [ 39 , 40 ] . \n there is good evidence for coordinated regulation of et-1 and et-3 . in individuals with high basal et-1 production , activation of preproet-3 expression through a feedback control mechanism may compensate for the pressor effects of the high circulating levels of et-1 . \n endothelin-3 stimulates nitric oxide synthase expression and no production through binding to the etb receptor , and increase of et-1 with a decrease of et-3 , due to endothelial dysfunction , has been reported in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension of various etiologies [ 42 , 43 ] . \n it is also possible that high or low transcriptional activity of both preproet-1 and preproet-3 genes within an individual is determined by genetic polymorphism or epigenetic conditioning of transacting elements with common cis - acting regulatory sequences between the two genes , but this remains to be investigated . in our analyses , the strongest associations were seen between saliva et-3 and plasma et-3 ( r = 0.75 , p < 0.001 ) and between saliva bet-1 and saliva et-1 ( r = 0.75 , p < 0.001 ) . an overall relationship between et-3 and bet-1 and \n its mature product et-1 was observed in plasma and saliva but was stronger in plasma ( figure 3 ) \n . the similar ratio of bet-1 to et-1 in plasma ( 3.35 versus 3.45  pmol / ml ) and saliva ( 0.55 versus 0.52  pmol / ml ) suggests a relative stability of the peptides during sampling and sample processing . \n however , although saliva et-2 correlated with plasma et-2 ( r = 0.51 , p = 0.004 ) , the poor correlation between et-2 and the other endothelin isoforms , within plasma ( positive , p > 0.05 ) and within saliva ( negative , p > 0.05 ) , is in line with the concept of et-2 regulatory pathways distinct from those of et-1 and et-3 . in conclusion , \n our data confirm an overall positive correlation between plasmatic and salivary bet-1 , et-1 , et-2 , and et-3 levels and between the bet-1 , et-1 , and et-3 within each of the two compartments . \n the isoform et-2 correlates poorly with et-1 and et-3 , within saliva and within plasma . \n salivary et isoform profiles portray the plasmatic profiles and support the view of coordinated regulation of et-1 and et-3 , but distinct regulatory pathways for et-2 .",
      "summary": "although saliva endothelins are emerging as valuable noninvasive cardiovascular biomarkers , reports on the relationship between isoforms in saliva and plasma remain scarce . \n we measured endothelins in concurrent saliva and plasma samples ( n = 30 males ; age 1863 ) by hplc - fluorescence . results revealed statistically significant positive correlations among all isoforms between saliva and plasma : big endothelin-1 ( bet-1 , 0.55  0.27 versus 3.35  1.28  pmol / ml ; r = 0.38 , p = 0.041 ) , endothelin-1 ( et-1 , 0.52  0.21 versus 3.45  1.28  pmol / ml ; r = 0.53 , p = 0.003 ) , endothelin-2 ( et-2 , 0.21  0.07 versus 1.63  0.66  pmol / ml ; r = 0.51 , p = 0.004 ) , and endothelin-3 ( et-3 , 0.39  0.19 versus 2.32  1.44 pmol / ml ; r = 0.75 , p < 0.001 ) \n . correlations of bet-1 , et-1 , and et-3 within each compartment were positive in both plasma ( p < 0.05 ) and saliva ( p  0.1 ) , whereas et-2 was not significantly correlated with other isoforms in either plasma or saliva . for all isoforms , concentrations varied on average fivefold between individuals ( 90th/10th percentiles ) ; individuals with high plasma endothelin levels generally had high saliva endothelin levels . \n our results reveal that salivary et isoform profiles portray the plasmatic profiles and support the view of coordinated regulation of et-1 and et-3 , but distinct regulatory pathways for et-2 .",

unexplained infertility and cervical mucus hostility ( 4 ) . \n the correlation between sperm quality and clinical outcomes has been distinguished in iui setting . in routine sperm preparation using swim - up or density gradients techniques , sperm are selected on the basis of progressive motility , morphological characteristics , and concentration for iui . \n these parameters , however , may not guarantee the selection of spermatozoa with normal dna / chromatin integrity ( 5 ) . \n sperm dna damage and apoptosis are useful indicators for male factor fertility and have a significant relation with infertility of men ( 6 , 7 ) . in testicular biopsies , increased rates of apoptosis \n it is not clear whether the apoptotic markers recognized in spermatozoa are the remainders of an inconclusive apoptotic process initiated before ejaculation or whether they result from apoptosis started in the post - ejaculation period ( 1 ) . \n apoptosis is a programmed cell death that takes place physiologically without any inflammation ( 9 ) . \n recent studies have indicated that protamine deficiency and sperm dna damage are associated with poor art outcomes ( 10 , 11 ) . \n cma3 reversibly binds to g - c base pairs in the minor groove of dna . \n it has been reported that sperm protamine deficiency is associated with fertilization failure ( 12 ) . \n considering the advantage of cma3 in assessment of protamine , and its possible use in andrology units , this quick evaluation of sperm with cma3 received much attention during recent years . \n evenson and his associates showed that abnormal chromatin packaging appears to be linked with nuclear dna damage ( 13 ) . \n the objective of this cross - sectional study was to assess the relationship of sperm parameters as well as chromatin integrity and apoptosis with iui outcomes in two groups of patients with female or mild male factor infertility . \n according to infertility etiology , patients were divided into two groups with mild male factor ( group m ;

19.3% ) than m group ( 1/29 ; 3.4% ; p = 0.06 ) . \n the data also showed that 28.6% ( 2/7 ) of the cases achieved multiple pregnancies . \n non - pregnant group showed a significant number of immotile sperm , when compared with pregnant patients ( p < 0.01 ) . \n with regard to infertility duration , no relation was noticed between duration of infertility and pregnancy rates ( table 2 ) . \n in addition , the results did not show any significant differences in age between pregnant and non - pregnant cases . \n comparisons of sperm parameters in two groups with female or male factor infertility undergoing iui data are presented as meansd , ns : not significant , values inside parentheses represent ( % ) comparisons of sperm characteristics in pregnant and non - pregnant patients data are presented as meansd , ns : not significant , values inside parentheses represent ( % ) the findings also showed that the rate of sperm with protamine deficiency increased in sperm samples from patients with mild male infertility , when compared with the other group ( p < 0.01 ; figure 1 ) . also , the rate of protamine deficiency significantly increased in non - pregnant when compared with pregnant patients ( p < 0.05 ; table 2 ) . \n other findings confirmed that there was no correlation between abnormal sperm morphology and increased rate of dna damage . \n however , our result showed that there were no significant differences in the rate of apoptosis in both groups of patients when compared between pregnant and not pregnant patients ( table 2 ; figure 2 ) . \n in addition , the result of comparison between male and female cases in correlation with sperm apoptosis was statistically similar . \n chromomycin a3 ( cma3 ) staining : cma3 + or protamine deficient spermatozoa appear as bright yellow , cma3- or spermatozoa with normal protamine appear yellowish green tunel staining : brown stained sperm shows apoptosis+ , light colored sperm indicates apoptosis \n some authors suggested that outcomes of semen with poor sperm morphology were comparable with normal sperm morphology in iui setting ( 16 ) . \n recently , it was demonstrated that both sperm morphology and progressive motility had positive effects on iui outcomes ( 17 ) . \n others found that normal sperm morphology can be considered as a predictor of iui success ( 18 ) . \n also , van voortis et al . noticed that semen with less than 10 million motile sperm was associated with lower pregnancy rates in iui cycles . \n it was shown that when the count of motile sperm was above 10 million , no significant increase would be achieved in iui pregnancy rates ( 19 ) . in this study , both sperm count and progressive motility were demonstrated to be lower in cases with mild male factor infertility when compared with female infertility . \n conversely , concentration of immotile spermatozoa was observed to be higher in male factor and non - pregnant patients when compared with the other group . prior to sperm preparation , total motile sperm of 3050% \n our findings showed that the rates of normal sperm morphology were similar in both infertile groups . \n therefore , sperm morphology criterion could not be a reliable predictive indication for iui outcome . \n however , assessment of sperm dna integrity can be used as a good practicability factor , particularly in patients with male infertility . \n the findings of this study indicates that in order to select the right candidates for clinical iui , it is necessary to perform cytochemcial assays to assess the sperm dna integrity of patients . \n these assays should be done in combination with semen analysis , especially for patients with male factor infertility . \n this study also showed that patients with mild male factor infertility are not suitable candidates for iui , since the rate of chromatin immaturity in their sperm was very high . \n therefore , they may benefit from other art techniques , such as icsi . in one study , \n sperm chromatin structure and dna integrity were known to have a critical effect on the rate of fertilization ( 21 ) . \n the sperm chromatin condensation was shown with cma3 assay ; indicating protamine defects during histone - protamine replacement of sperm chromatin condensation in the testicular phase ( 21 ) . in this \n ( 2003 ) stated that infertile men had higher rate of sperm dna fragmentation and chromatin defects . \n they showed that dna fragmentation index ( dfi ) has a direct relation with the overall pregnancy rate ( 22 ) . \n similarly , bungum et al . also found that couples who failed pregnancy after iui had an increased rate of sperm dna damage ( 23 ) . \n the aforesaid group also showed that in iui cases in which sperm dna damage exceeds 30% , the pregnancy success rates is close to zero ( 24 ) . in agreement with saleh et al . \n regarding chromatin defects , our work confirmed that the rate of sperm chromatin immaturity significantly increased in infertile men , while the rate of pregnancy decreased in cases with male infertility . \n cma3 assay seems to be a more efficient assay than apoptosis which can be applied as a reliable marker for prognosis of pregnancy success in iui program . \n ( 2003 ) also believed that sperm chromatin structure assay ( scsa ) parameter is correlated with the level of immotile spermatozoa and the percentage of chromatin packaging in art . \n however , they showed that dfi parameter is independent of sperm motility ( 25 ) . in 2007 , one study demonstrated that 1020% of patients became pregnant following iui program , which is similar to our cases ( 26 ) . \n recently , lucchini and her colleagues reported 11% rate of pregnancy outcomes from their superovulated iui cases ( 4 ) . \n also , they stated that some relevant characteristics of pregnancy were younger age , minimal duration of infertility and male infertility factors ( 17 ) . \n moreover , dorjpurev showed that sperm washing / processing did not affect the pregnancy outcomes . \n however , it is better to wash the ejaculates in order to separate a good fraction of spermatozoa from seminal plasma , leukocyte and non - motile spermatozoa ( 17 , 18 ) . also , sperm processing is suitable for preventing the transmission of infectious agents and prostaglandin to the uterus . \n another finding was related to the correlation between rates of immotile sperm with lower pregnancy after iui . in art , \n multiple pregnancies are evaluated with incidence reports of 6.525% ( 28 ) . in our study , the rates of multiple pregnancies were higher than the aforementioned study . \n our findings also showed that the rates of sperm apoptosis assay were approximately similar in two groups of mild male and female patients . \n this may indicate that apoptosis does not play a major role in prediction of iui outcomes . \n this study confirmed that there was no correlation between abnormal sperm morphology and high rate of dna damage in iui program . \n therefore , this technology may not be recommended for patients with mild male infertility , since high rate of dna damage was observed in their spermatozoa . \n also , it might be better to plan other art programs for male factor cases . \n ",

enhanced prospectively electrocardiogram - gated ct calcium score was performed using a 250 mm field of view and 2.5 mm slice thickness . \n the calcium scores for individual vessels were computed using the inbuilt software supplemented by manual identification of the calcified locations defined by areas with attenuation > 130 hu along the course of the coronary arteries . \n noncoronary calcification ( sinuses of valsalva , mitral annulus ) was cautiously excluded while measuring calcification . \n these values were the sum of the area and density of the coronary calcium giving the unitless agatston score . \n radiation dose range was 56.065.5 mgy*cm and average was 59.84 mgy*cm . for analysis purpose , \n a ccs cut off 1000 is used to define those with very calcium score > 1000 ( very high ccs group ) from those with high ccs between 350 and 1000 ( high ccs group ) . \n based on individual vessel calcium score , they are divided into the following four groups , namely , none or noncalcified ( ccs - 0 ) , low or mildly calcified ( ccs - 1100 ) , moderately calcified ( ccs - 101300 ) , and heavily calcified ( ccs ->300 ) . \n fifty of the 52 patients underwent conventional ca . the syntax score ( ss ) known to represent the global atherosclerotic burden \n was calculated for all patients using the online calculator version 2.11 ( http://www.syntaxscore.com ) by two separate cardiologists blinded for the calcium score . \n concordant scores were accepted , whereas a discordant score was evaluated by a third cardiologist for validation . \n the lesions in individual coronary arteries are coded on an ordinal scale from normal to total occlusion with insignificant lesions defined as those ranging from any luminal irregularity to < 70% , significant lesions with > 70% luminal narrowing , and total as those with 100% occlusion . \n the 2008 framingham risk score ( frs ) was calculated for individual patients from their history , physical examination findings , and blood investigations , and they are divided into a low , intermediate , and high risk based on the cut off 10% , 10%20% , and > 20% 10-year predicted risk for a cardiovascular event , respectively . \n the coronary stenosis , frs , and fluoroscopic calcium were studied as ordinal data , whereas the calcium score and the ss are studied as a continuous data . \n the association between continuous variables is studied using the pearson 's correlation coefficient , whereas the association between ordinal data is studied using nonparametric tests ( spearman 's co - efficient ) . \n standard error of mean was calculated for continuous variables between the groups with and without significant stenosis using the independent sample t - test if they are normally distributed ; else a nonparametric test like kruskal  wallis test was used . a receiver operator curve ( roc ) \n was plotted for the total ccs and individual arterial calcium scores against the presence of a flow limiting stenosis for the corresponding patient or vessel to derive the sensitivity and specificity cut off for ccs in predicting a significant stenosis . \n the coronary stenosis , frs , and fluoroscopic calcium were studied as ordinal data , whereas the calcium score and the ss are studied as a continuous data . \n the association between continuous variables is studied using the pearson 's correlation coefficient , whereas the association between ordinal data is studied using nonparametric tests ( spearman 's co -

associated difference in the correlation between ccs and ss score ( 0.66 for females and 0.64 for males ) . \n calcium in the coronary arteries is believed to represent a dystrophic process , where the worn - out tissues of the aging vessels with plaques are replaced by calcium . \n this process is mediated by the calcium - binding glycophosphoprotein osteopontin . according to the american heart association , staging of the coronary atherosclerotic plaques calcification \n is a feature of stage v , but with refined microscopic techniques micro calcification can be identified from stage iii onward . \n the location of calcification is also variable , which may be intimal , medial , or adventitial . \n as macroscopic coronary calcification is a late stage in the progress of atherosclerosis , in any cross - sectional autopsy series that included patients from all age groups , only 20% of plaques are found to be calcified . \n furthermore , the process of calcification indicates stabilization of plaques along with positive remodeling leading to compensation for the lumen loss caused by the plaque . \n it is for these reasons that the identification of coronary calcium though predicts the vascular age and the global atherosclerotic burden of the patient , and it is not specific for a vulnerable plaque or a significantly stenotic lesion . supporting this fact , there are many reports of documented absent coronary calcium that was followed by acute coronary syndromes within months \n this has led to the discouragement of recommending calcium scoring as diagnostic rather than a screening test for risk stratification . \n any ctca protocol includes a plain scan at low radiation , and when that shows sufficiently high calcium known to interfere with final interpretation , the procedure might be abandoned . in such patients , \n published literature on calcium scoring are mainly for risk stratification in asymptomatic subjects . based on large population - based studies \n , it has been shown to be of benefit in predicting cardiovascular events . in our study \n , we have shown that a high coronary calcium correlates strongly and significantly with the global coronary plaque burden as derived by the ss . \n it was also found that the individual vessel calcium scores were correlating strongly with the presence of any lesion that may be anything above 30% narrowing , but only weakly with a significant stenosis defined by a luminal narrowing of 70% [ figure 7 ] . the sensitivity and specificity of calcium score to predict a significant lesion is higher at patient level than at vessel level which again reinforces the fact that ccs is a marker of global atherosclerotic burden rather than a marker of a focal significant lesion [ figure 8 ] . \n it is also plausible with the pathogenesis of coronary calcification which occurs in older plaques rather than a significant plaque , and the majority of the coronary plaques are not significant but may be older and usually outnumber significant plaques by 35-fold . \n the ss mandates scoring for any lesion 50% stenosis in vessels that are 1.5 mm . as a result \n , borderline lesions also contribute to the overall score and hence correlating with ccs irrespective of the severity of lesion , not necessarily significant one . \n we have also found that ss correlated strongly with the frs which is also pathogenetically plausible as frs represents the vascular age based on the patients risk profile . \n the limitations of our study include the small number of patients included , but this could be compensated by the number of vessels studied , as both calcium scoring and lesions on ca were computed and analyzed for individual coronary arteries ( lm , lad , lcx , rca , and pda ) . the second limitation of our study could be that 70% of the studied population were high risk according to the 2008 frs and so they are expected to have a higher vascular age . \n hence , extrapolating this to the low and intermediate risk group may not hold true . \n it is also plausible that the high frs would have confounded the strong correlation of the ccs with the ss , but the r value for ccs and ss is stronger than the r value for frs and ss . \n this again reinforces the fact that ccs may have incremental value over and above the frs for any given patient in predicting the atherosclerotic burden . \n we have a subtle evidence for the same in the form of loss of significant correlation of the ccs to ss in those with a total score < 1000 . \n the strength of our study includes the following : ( 1 ) the ccs is done by an experienced radiologist . \n ( 2 ) the ca was interpreted by two cardiologists with a third one validating any dispute . \n axial plain computed tomography images in a 45-year - old male show extensive calcification in the left anterior descending ( a ) and left circumflex ( b ) indicated by arrow ; catheter angiogram ( c ) showing normal left anterior descending ( long arrow ) and left circumflex ( short arrow ) . \n axial plain computed tomography images in a 53-year - male show extensively calcified left anterior descending ( a ) and left circumflex ( b ) indicated by arrow ; catheter angiography image ( c ) showing multiple foci ( arrows ) of insignificant and significant stenosis in left anterior descending . \n high ct calcium scores in this cohort of intermediate to high ( framingham score ) risk patients correlated strongly with the subject 's global burden of the cad as derived by the ss , more so for subjects with very high scores . similarly , high ccs predicted significant stenosis at both individual and arterial levels ; also , the arterial vessel scores correlated strongly for any lesion but only weakly for the presence a significant stenosis . in spite of this association between ccs and the flow - limiting disease on conventional angiogram , a proportion of patients may still have insignificant disease when ccs is between 350 and 1000 . \n  \n ",

      "document": "lumbar spine instability has been reported to be the leading cause of chronic back \n pain1 . \n an a abnormal vertebral joint \n creates mechanical lesions and pains in the lumbar spine , decreasing stability and \n increasing the range of motion , resulting in functional degeneration2 . \n these negative patterns have a variety of forms such as \n aging , medical history , and exercise deficiency and present serious problems in the age \n group of 2040 , due to developments of modern society and recent changes in various working \n forms of work3 , 4 . herniated nucleus pulposus ( hnp ) is a representative disease of the functional vertebral \n unit that occurs when the pulposus nucleus is exposed by rupture of the annulus fibrosus and \n it is a disease that causes chronic back pains5 , 6 . \n chronic back pain patients not only have \n weak deep muscles of the lumbar region and muscle imbalance compared to normal subjects , but \n also show reduction in the re - positioning ability which leads to problem with the stability \n of the spine , due to the reduction in proprioceptive sense , which causes lumbar pain and \n recurrence7 , 8 . \n they include exercises \n for increasing muscle strength , improving functions , and maintaining posture as well as \n preventing excessive movements of the lumbar spine9 . \n exercise rehabilitation approaches for strength and stability are \n important even after surgical treatments , due to degeneration and restricted activities10 , 11 \n and conservative methods of treatment by exercise have been recommended for the purpose of \n preventing recurrence of pain and improving functions12,13,14,15,16 . \n thus , exercise therapies based on the stabilization exercises are \n considered to be necessary for preventing chronic pain and reductions in functional \n capabilities by the reduction of functional instability in various of type and the \n improvement of motor functional capabilities of the lumbar joints . \n therefore , this study aims to help adult women with lumbar disc herniation recover muscle \n strength and stability through 8-week lumber extension strength exercise programs , and to \n provide data for constructing an integrated exercise program . \n in this study , an 8-week exercise program for lumbar muscle extension strength and \n stabilization was performed by 26 females older than 20 with lumbar disc herniation . \n this \n study was approved by the hankuk university of foreign studies and the institution where it \n was performed , and it complied with the ethical principles of the declaration of helsinki . \n the purposes and process of the study were fully explained to the subjects and their consent \n was obtained before participation . \n the subjects mean  sd was 27.2  4.4  years old their mean  \n sd height was 162.3  5.1  cm and their mean  sd weight was 55.4  7.1  kg . \n the programs was conducted for a total of 8 weeks , 60 minutes a session , twice a week , to \n improve strength and stabilize lumbar extension . \n the exercise program was divided into \n warm - up exercises , main exercises and cool - down exercises . \n the warm - up exercises and \n cool - down exercises were conducted focusing on the range of joint motion ( rom ) without pain , \n utilizing cycles and steppers for 10 minutes , alternately . for the purpose of improving the \n lumbar stability and resistance muscles , \n the main exercises were designed to be individually \n conducted in the form of a circuit training in which the number of repetitions increased \n gradually , utilizing sling and weight exercise equipment . a lumbar extension strength machine ( medx , medx inc . , ocala , fl , usa ) was utilized for the \n evaluation of lumbar extensor strength . \n the maximum static muscular strength of lumbar \n extension was measured at 7 different angles of lumbar flexion : 0 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , and \n 72 degrees . \n passive tests were conducted to determine whether to limit the range of motion \n before measurement . \n the tests were conducted 12 times at 45 lbs in accordance with the medx \n exercise measurement guidelines . \n the measurement was performed after fixing the pelvis and \n thigh of the subjects on the support . \n then , the motion of the lumbar spine was limited \n during measurement by adjusting the footrest . \n the subjects were asked to increasingly extend \n the lumbar spine by sufficiently considering the limited angular range of motion of the \n joints . \n the measurements were performed in the same manner at every angle by maintaining \n maximum muscle contraction for about 2 seconds . \n for the physical stability \n measurements , the total weight distribution index ( wdi ) was calculated by assessing the \n degree of interaction and coordination of the lower body through body away while maintaining \n a standing posture . for data processing , the statistical program spss ( spss inc . , \n the mean and standard deviation of the measurements was calculated for all metrics . to \n compare the difference between the pre -

exercise and post - exercise15 in \n lumbar muscle extension strength at all 7 angles of lumbar flexion , proving that exercise \n participation develops stability of the muscles around the lumbar spine . \n in addition , a \n study analyzing the effects of decompression therapy by 4-week joint mobilization that was \n performed for patients with lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus , reported improvements in \n joint range of motion in flexion and extension21 , proving its effectiveness . similarly , a study of13 lumbar traction for patients with lumbar \n herniated nucleus pulposus , and a study11 \n of lumbar discectomy and stabilization exercises for patients with lumbar herniated nucleus \n pulposus , both reported improvements in flexion and extension . \n the improvements in functions \n pursuant to improved muscle strength and stability were statistically significant , as were \n the results of the studies cited above . \n therefore , prevention of excessive movement of the \n lumbar spine and trunk , in the patients with chronic back pains or lumbar herniated nucleus \n pulposus can be helpful in their daily life because they secure the joint range of motion , \n thereby improving strength and stability9 . \n thus , the development of muscular strength for stabilization and integrated exercise for \n pain reduction and rehabilitation help to maintain the range of joint motion , muscle \n strength , and balance21,22,23 . for the \n improvement and rehabilitation of inpaired capacity in daily life due to back \n pain -

      "document": "in a recent study we provided experimental evidence that sorla indeed is the molecular link between app and the retromer sorting complex . \n the cargo binding activity of the retromer is historically assigned to the trimer of vps26-vps29-vps35 , whereas the snx subunit is responsible for membrane association ( reviewed recently in refs ) . \n numerous studies have previously identified vps35 as the receptor binding component . however , in our study we have demonstrated that vps26 binds directly to a cargo receptor , i.e. , the cytoplasmic tail of sorla . \n this is in line with vps26 containing an arrestin fold , which is a conformation found to be responsible for cargo - binding activity in other proteins . \n also , we found that the receptor interaction with vps26 was dependent on a phenylalanine residue located in a six amino acid fanshy - sequence in the tail of sorla . \n this agrees well with retromer subunits previously shown to prefer binding to aromatic sorting motifs . \n to study the functional relevance of the interaction between retromer and sorla , we generated a sorla mutant carrying six alanine residues instead of the fanshy motif ( i.e. , sorla fanshy6a ) . using this sorla mutant \n we observed a mis - targeting to the endosomal compartments of the mutant receptor in line with retromer s role in retrograde transport . \n subsequently , we focused on the localization of the sorla - fanshy6a by performing co - localization studies between non - mutated sorla ( sorla - wt ) and sorla - fanshy6awithin the same cell . \n these results confirmed that the mutated and the non - mutated sorla receptors localize differently , with sorla - wt found in the perinulear region corresponding to the tgn compartment and sorla - fanshy6a found in a more distal vesicular compartment representing late / recycling endosomes and/or tubular endosomal network ( ten ) . \n this clearly shows that a lack of retromer binding alters receptor localization by impairing the retrograde trafficking from peripheral compartments ( i.e. , the ten ) back to the golgi . \n based on these observations , we speculated that this mislocalization might influence the function of sorla keeping app from processing . \n this was relevant based on previous findings where we showed that sorla exert part of its function by slowing app exit from the golgi into the secretory pathway whereby app avoids cleavage by the secretases . in order to analyze the exact role of sorla in retromer - dependent app sorting , \n we have now determined whether retromer is able to retrieve app from the endosomal compartments independent of its interaction with sorla . \n accordingly , by triple immunohistochemical staining of sh - sy5y we found a strong co - localization between app and retromer ( i.e. , vps35 ) in the presence of sorla - wt ( fig .  1 ) . \n in contrast , there was very little co - localization between app and vps35 when cells express the sorla - fanshy6a mutant that is unable to associate with retromer ( fig .  1 ) . \n this set of data clearly demonstrates that sorla activity is needed to bridge retromer and app . \n sorla - wt expression , but not sorla - fanshy6a , mediates co - localization between retromer and app . \n sh - sy5y cells transfected with either sorla - wt ( left panel ) or sorla - fanshy6a ( right panel ) were stained with an antibody against the extracellular domain of sorla ( in red ) , or the endogenously expressed proteins app ( in green ) and vps35 ( in blue ) . \n co - localization of the trimeric complex between app , vps35 and sorla - wt is indicated by white arrow heads . \n having identified sorla as a protein binding both app and retromer , we next asked whether sorla also is involved in the mechanism where retromer is reported to decrease amyloid production . \n it was therefore of interest to determine how the sorla mutant , not retrieving back to the perinuclear region , behaved in terms of app trafficking and subsequent processing . \n first , to study app transport we used live cell imaging confirming previous data , which showed that sorla - wt significantly decreased the velocity and distance traveled by app . however , upon mutation of the fanshy motif this effect is completely abolished although the receptor mutant is still able to associate with app in the ten . \n second , we also found that the app : sorla - fanshy6a complex formed in the peripheral ten did not lead to any decrease of a production compared with sorla - wt binding app early in the secretory pathway . \n these findings lead to a model where retromer and sorla co - operate in the retention of app in the perinuclear region , where sorla is the direct binding partner of app and retromer functions in the retrieval of sorla from the endosomal compartment back to early compartments of the secretory pathway ( fig .  2 ) . \n after mutation of the fanshy sequence , sorla is no longer able to interact with retromer . by disrupting this interaction , sorla \n app will then localize into other cellular compartments where app is more prone to secretase cleavage . since endosomal processing leads to production of a , increasing endosomal delivery of app increases the amyloidogenic processing . \n this change in localization of app is important because sorla can only protect against app processing when located in the tgn . \n this is supported by the fact that sorla - fanshy6a can not protect against app cleavage . when the retromer binding site is deleted sorla is not recycled back to tgn , but rather stays in the late endosomal compartment , where sorla has no impact on app . \n this model explains how genomic deficiency or misfunction of either sorla or retromer can influence app processing . \n these results not only shed new light on the mechanism of how retromer deficiency may lead to ad , but also provided new insight of how app sorting receptors are key players in a metabolism . \n based on our studies , we believe that the retromer complex is indeed the adaptor protein necessary for the retrieval of sorla from the endosomes to the tgn , and the localization of sorla in the tgn together with app is of crucial importance for regulating the processing of app . once disrupting the retromer binding site , the cellular distribution of sorla is changed , and sorla is no longer able to protect against the production of a.",
      "summary": "deficiency in the retromer sorting pathway is known to be associated with the onset of alzheimer disease ( ad ) , and has been suggested to involve regulation of amyloid precursor protein ( app ) trafficking . \n absence of the app sorting receptor sorla is also associated to ad , as amyloidogenic processing of app is increased due to missorting . reduced activity of either retromer or sorla thus both lead to enhanced amyloidogenic app processing , and these pathways are therefore important factors for understanding the development of ad . \n it is therefore key to outline the neuronal app trafficking in order to determine the mechanisms that influence ad onset .",

(Helmut Fohringer/AFP/Getty)\n\nThe leaflets warn of the dangers of still and stagnant water as breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and methods for such holdings to be removed and prevented.\n\nScientists believe the Zika virus is linked to a surge in Brazil of babies being born with the brain defect microcephaly.\n\nDefence Minister Aldo Rebelo was present in Sao Paulo for the start of the public action phase of the campaign against the virus, which he said has spread throughout the whole Brazilian territory.\n\nThe Brazilian government announced a suspected link between Zika virus and microcephaly, a rare birth defect that sees babies born with unusually small heads and can cause lasting developmental problems. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\n\"Our mobilization today involves members of the army, the navy and the air force, in all 25 states and the Federal District, and also involves the participation of military personnel already trained in the eradication of mosquito breeding grounds.\n\n\"This will be followed by other phases. Today we are working to reduce the proliferation of the mosquito,\" Rebelo said.\n\nThe next phase of the operation will begin on Monday, involving residential visits by the armed forces to identify problem areas and distribute larvicid and insecticide.",

      "document": "WASHINGTON\u2014 After about eight weeks in office, the new Adminstration is moderating its policies and even its language - not much but some. It has convinced the country that El Salvador is not a five-cent cigar, but it is no longer talking as if the crisis in Central America were a threat to world peace.\n\nThere are some other signs of common sense. President Reagan made a superb conciliatory speech to the Parliament in Ottawa and will meet again with President Lopez Portillo of Mexico next month.\n\nHe is also resisting the pressure of the protectionists to impose restrictions on the import of Japanese cars -though this is a savage and divisive controversy - and he has put Vice President Bush in charge of preparing for what promises to be an important conference with the other leaders of the industrial nations in Canada next July.\n\nNothing surprises Washington more than a new President who is faithful to his campaign promises, and Reagan has done better on this than most of his recent predecessors. But he has taken the rising opposition to his Economic Recovery Program seriously, and is trying to avoid unnecessary conflict with the Democrats, much to the despair of some of his more unyielding supporters.\n\nFor example, some of his old penthouse buddies in California have been raising tax deductible funds to propagandize his economic program and telling prospective contributors that ''the President wants this and the President wants that.'' Also, that the names of such contributors would not be published.\n\nThis has irritated Robert Byrd, the Senate Minority Leader, among other influential Democrats, and the White House, through Chief of Staff James Baker, has told the leaders of this private Republican fund-raising organization to keep the President's name out of their solicitations and remember that he favors disclosure of the names of contributors.\n\nIt is in the field of foreign affairs, however, where there is a noticable change of emphasis. Secretary of State Haig is no longer saying that the Soviets must accept a civilized ''code of internatinoal conduct'' before talking with them about the control of nuclear weapons, world trade, the Middle East and other critical problems.\n\nHe does not concede that he is changing his tone on El Salvador, Afghanistan, Poland or anything else, but he is now talking publicly about talking to the Soviets, provided they don't make things worse by using force in Poland, and even if they don't withdraw from Afghanistan.\n\nHaig is under considerable pressure not to enhance the range and fighting power of the 62 F-15 planes sold by the Carter Administration to Saudi Arabia, but he is sticking to this deal, despite the opposition of Israel and influential Jewish leaders in this country.\n\nIn fact, with the approval of the President and the Pentagon, Haig is pressing for more rapid construction, at increased cost, of military facilities from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean.\n\nThese would include the improvement, at a cost of over $100 million, of a base at the Egyptian port of Ras Banas across the narrow Red Sea from a major oil terminal in Saudi Arabia; also the construction of a former British base on the island of Masira off the coast of Oman; and other improved military facilities in Oman, Somalia, Kenya, and the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThese would not provide the permanent ''on the ground'' bases for U.S. troops Haig is understood to prefer, but they would be available to the Navy and the Rapid Deployment Force if the nations concerned agreed later for their emergency use.\n\nAll this, however, will take years to complete, and the Administration is not emphasizing the program. It is merely trying to make clear to the Soviets that it intends to defend its vital interests in the oilfields, by force if necessary, but it does not want the Soviets to have grounds for believing that this is a policy of ''encirclement.''\n\nNevertheless, the allies have been counseling caution, and urging Haig to cool the anti-Soviet rhetoric. Britain is pre-occupied with its economy, and the French with this summer's election, but their fear is that the anti-Soviet thrust of the Reagan Administration might persuade the Soviets that no reconciliation between East and West is possible and, therefore, that Moscow should concentrate on the defense of its borders, by sticking in Afghanistan and taking over Poland if necessary.\n\nNo doubt the recent visits here of French, British and German officials have contributed to the more moderate and balanced statements by the Administration in recent days. The allies have mixed feelings about the Reagan budget, approving stronger defenses, yet fearing that Reagan has mainly transferred money from social programs to the Pentagon and not really dealt with his sagging economy, which is the main concern of the industrial nations.\n\nThis is also the theme that worries the Congress. On the whole, the calmer language on foreign affairs is approved on Capitol Hill, for it was diverting attention from the President's recovery program, and both parties now seem to agree that it is the economy that is the ''present danger'' to the security of the nation.",

      "document": "potentially inappropriate use of medications ( pim ) use in the elderly places a significant burden on the healthcare system . in the united states \n incremental cost of pim use in the elderly is estimated to be $ 7.2 billion , pim use in ambulatory elderly patients has been found to be 50 per 1,000 person years . \n the elderly population is especially susceptible to use of pim as up to 94% take at least one pim . \n pim is defined as use of a drug with risk of an adverse event that outweighs its clinical benefit , particularly when there is a safer or more effective alternative therapy for the same condition . \n beers criteria to assess and reduce the risk of pim in the elderly by identifying pim has been developed . \n utilization of this criteria has shown pims to be associated with a 25% increase in the risk of hospitalizations in elderly nursing home residents . \n in addition , the incidence of pim use has been reported to range from 22% to 66% during hospitalization , and 44% upon discharge . \n geriatric population is very fragile and prone to medication side effects in view of changing physiological capacities of the body . \n the decline is much more rapid when co morbidities , especially diabetes and hypertension set in . \n there is a corresponding decline in other body systems , including : cardiac , respiratory , gastrointestinal , and neurovascular . \n this results in accentuated drug side effects and toxicities secondary to slowed pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics . \n this is the subset of population where more and more use of polypharmacy and pim use is observed . \n however , there are very few studies available evaluating the association of pims with hospital readmission . \n mansur and colleagues evaluated several objectives in a cohort of hospitalized elderly patients , including the relationship of pims with readmission and mortality , 3 months post discharge . \n they found no significant difference in pim use among patients who were readmitted or died as compared to those who were not readmitted or survived . \n however , this trial had several limitations , including a small sample size of 212 patients . \n the present study was designed to see if polypharmacy and/or pim use was related to readmission rates to the hospital irrespective of the admission diagnosis . \n the objective of this study was to evaluate the association of pim use with hospital readmission within 30 days regardless of the admitting diagnosis . \n this nested case - control study included all patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge to a 250 bed community hospital located in scranton , pennsylvania usa . all patients 65 years of age or older admitted between january 2008 and december 2009 were eligible for study enrollment . \n day 0 was defined as the day of discharge and day1 was defined as the day - after surgery . \n the present study included all the consecutive readmissions and no controls were used for comparison . \n the modified beer 's criteria is the most widely followed drug list that is used to screen potentially inappropriate drug use in the geriatric population [ table 1 ] . \n modified beer criteria showing list of the potential associated with inappropriate usage of medicines this was a retrospective case record review of 414 patients who were hospitalized within 30 days of discharge from the hospital between january 2008 and december 2009 . \n there was no bias in the selection of patients on the basis of age , sex , co morbidities , height , weight , marital status , ethnicity , and socio - economic status . \n the institutional review board of hospital approved the study and waived the requirement for informed consent for the retrospective review of medical records . \n the goal of the study was to identify the patient characteristics associated with readmission to the hospital within 30 days of discharge from the hospital . \n day 0 was defined as readmission on the same day before midnight and any readmission after midnight was defined as 1 day . \n rest of the readmissions were defined as within 30 days of discharge but after day 1 . \n demographic and laboratory data was retrieved from an electronic hospital database . after merging data from the different sources , automated and manual data verification was performed . \n statistical analysis was carried out using a two - way anova on the data to see if polypharmacy and/or pim use was related to readmission within 30 days of discharge irrespective of admission diagnosis . \n this was a retrospective case record review of 414 patients who were hospitalized within 30 days of discharge from the hospital between january 2008 and december 2009 . \n there was no bias in the selection of patients on the basis of age , sex , co morbidities , height , weight , marital status , ethnicity , and socio -

called never events . \n the list of the never events has been gradually increasing over the last couple of years . \n the expansion of never events and hospital acquired conditions by center of medicare and medicaid ( cms ) would have a substantial financial impact on tertiary care facilities . \n this is in sharp contrast to earlier trends when hospitals were reimbursed irrespective of the quality of the services offered . \n costs have continued to rise at double - digit rates , and quality is far from optimal . in the 21 century , we see aging of the population ; the fastest growing population being people over 85 years of age . \n adverse drug events , which can be especially problematic in older adults , often can be prevented by detecting potential risk factors . \n many primary care doctors possess a poor knowledge of pim and are unaware of prescribing guidelines such as the beers criteria . \n also there is poor communication of drugs potential side effects profile between the physician and the patient . \n hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge from the hospital is a multifaceted dragon which has to be dealt with a multipronged approach . \n a substantial amount of economic resources are spent on readmissions , especially in terms of finances . \n the most common cause of readmission by admitting diagnosis is congestive heart failure followed by psychosis [ figure 4 ] . \n the usual approach is to blame it on the disease process without addressing the patients co - morbidities . at the hospital , where this study was conducted , \n this study was designed to quantify the use of inappropriate medications among older adult outpatients . \n patients have a more difficult time trying to remember their drug regimen daily and can infringe on quality of life . not to forget to mention the cost of the polypharmacy . \n healthcare spending is also increased with more follow - up visits to doctor 's offices . \n healthcare spending can also involve the side effects caused by polypharmacy that can include acute drug reactions and readmissions . \n tracking the number of patients who experience unplanned readmissions to a hospital after a previous hospital stay is another category of data used to judge the quality of hospital care . in usa , \n cms services began to look into the issue after a national push by the obama administration . in usa \n , the president 's health - care reform has identified readmission rates as a key target for medical care savings . \n the hospital compare site allows patients to compare hospitals based on the how the rate of readmission for three treatments  heart attack , heart failure , and pneumonia  compare with the national average . \n the rates take into account how sick patients were before they were admitted to the hospital . \n the modified beer 's criteria is the most widely followed drug list that is used to screen potentially inappropriate drug use in the geriatric population . for a complet e list of medications included in the beer 's criteria \n although it remains a useful screening tool to screen for pim , its practical application in acute - care settings remains obscure . \n critics of the beer 's criteria opine that it is too big to be implemented in its entirety in the acute - care settings . \n in fact adrs could contribute to accelerated functional decline in elderly hospitalized patients independently of the use of beers listed pims . \n for example , pregabalin is very poorly tolerated by geriatric population and is not included in the beer 's criteria . furthermore , potentially any medication could be inappropriate in the geriatric population if it is not titrated by the physiological decline , especially renal decline . in this subset of population , \n , all anticholinergics , opiods , and benzodiazepams should raise a red flag , especially at the time of medication reconciliation . \n consideration should be placed on benefit to risk ratio when a new medication is added . on each hospitalization \n there should be a diligent review of the drug profile and every effort should be made to minimize medications . \n screening tool of older persons pim ( stopp ) have recently found favor as a tool for screening pim . in the hospital setting , proton pump inhibitors ( ppi ) are very commonly prescribed and are the most over prescribed medications . \n this not only compounds the cost of healthcare delivery but is detrimental to the patients medical management by increasing morbidity . along with the over prescribed ppi 's , \n a significant portion of the geriatric population is on clopidogrel because of coexistent coronary artery disease . \n ppi added in conjunction with plavix has a 64% higher risk of re hospitalization for myocardial infraction mi or coronary stent placement than patients receiving plavix alone . \n there is also an increase in stent thrombosis in patients who are on both plavix and ppis . \n healthcare professionals should be vigilant patient advocates when it comes to polypharmacy or at least be cautious of all the side effects . \n this is to drive home the point that pim use be at the back of the mind with a larger goal to minimize polypharmacy . \n antidepressants are another class of medications , which is widely used in the geriatric population but does not figure into the beer 's criteria . considering the benefit to risk ratio the widespread use of antidepressants need to be minimized . if we look at the natural course of depression , 60% of the cases are self - resolving \n if we consider the side effects profile to antidepressants , there is an extensive list and of course like most other medication , side effects are more pronounced in the elderly . \n most patients are on antidepressants forever because most physicians are hesitant to taper them off . \n a good discharge plan should include a meticulous medication reconciliation especially weighing the benefit to risk ratio . \n we would also recommend a mandated continued medical education on pim on renewal of state license . \n a good surgeon knows when not to operate and a good physician knows when not to give medicines . \n polypharmacy is a big contributor to increasing healthcare cost and increasing morbidity as well as mortality in the elderly population . \n there should be focused attention on all patients whether in hospital , or in physician 's follow - up clinic towards minimizing polypharmacy . \n if clinicians practice polypharmacy , they are bound to lead to use of pim . in our opinion , internship year should be geared towards orienting the physicians to focus on the geriatric aspect of medicine and improve medication use in elderly population . \n this is important because india is seeing rapid surge of elderly with infrastructure and health care system ill equipped to handle it . \n we would need a larger prospective multicenter randomized controlled intervention study to assess the effect of optimization strategies on the appropriateness of prescribing in elderly people .",
      "summary": "background and aim : readmission to the hospital within 30 days of discharge from the hospital is a common occurrence . \n congestive heart failure is the most common cause of readmissions in the hospital . \n we hypothesized that irrespective of the admission diagnosis polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate use of medications ( pim ) leads to readmissions within 30 days of discharge from the hospital.materials and methods : a retrospective study was carried out by reviewing the hospital records of 414 patients who were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge from the hospital between january 2008 and december 2009 . \n the data was stratified to see which patients were on polypharmacy and/or on pim . \n polypharmacy was defined as use of more than 5 medications . \n pim was defined as per the modified beers criteria . \n day 0 was defined as the day of discharge and day1 was defined as the day - after admission to the hospital . \n statistical analysis was carried out using a two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) on the data to see if polypharmacy and/or pim was related to readmission within 30 days of discharge irrespective of admission diagnosis.results:polypharmacy was related to hospital readmission at day 1 and day 0 , however inappropriate drug use was found to be not related at any day . \n polypharmacy and pim combined had a positive correlation to readmission only on days 1 and 0 and it was statistically significant . \n the use of minimal and appropriate use of drugs was statistically significant compared to polypharmacy and pim use.conclusions:polypharmacy and pim are under recognized cause of readmissions to the hospital .",

however , in case of subtotal excision , adjuvant radiotherapy is advised . \n radiosurgery as primary or adjuvant therapy is increasingly becoming an option as advances in radiosurgical equipment are enabling safe and accurate targeting of lesions . \n though purely extradural cavernomas are rare in occurrence , they should be considered as possible differential diagnosis of dumbbell lesions of spine in view of operative nuances ( especially massive haemorrhage ) and management thereof .",

      "document": "The FSM and RMI are independent countries about 3,000 miles southwest of Hawaii. The FSM is a federation of four semiautonomous states\u2014Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap\u2014whose population and income vary widely. Chuuk, the largest state by population, has the lowest per-capita gross domestic product (GDP). Overall, the FSM had a 2016 population of approximately 102,000 and a GDP per capita of about $3,200. The RMI\u2019s 2016 population was approximately 54,000 with a GDP per capita of about $3,600. The RMI\u2019s most recent census, in 2011, found that approximately three-quarters of the population lived in Majuro, the nation\u2019s capital, and on the island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll. Table 1 shows the FSM\u2019s, FSM states\u2019, and RMI\u2019s estimated populations and annual GDP per capita in fiscal year 2016. U.S. relations with the FSM and the RMI began during World War II, when the United States ended Japanese occupation of the region. Starting in 1947, the United States administered the region under a United Nations trusteeship. In 1986, after a period of negotiations, the United States entered into a compact of free association with the FSM and RMI that provided for economic assistance to the two countries, secured U.S. defense rights, and allowed FSM and RMI citizens to migrate to the United States. In 2003, after a period of negotiations, the United States approved separate amended compacts with the FSM and the RMI that went into effect on June 25, 2004, and May 1, 2004, respectively. The amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation authorized and appropriated direct financial assistance to the FSM and the RMI in fiscal years 2004 through 2023, with the base amounts decreasing in most years. The legislation also provided for partial inflation adjustment of the base amount of compact sector grants and trust fund contributions each year. As the base amount of compact sector grants decreases, the trust fund contributions generally increase by an equivalent amount. Because the annual inflation adjustment is less than full inflation, the value of compact sector grants declines in real terms. Figure 1 shows the amount of compact sector grants and trust fund contributions each fiscal year from 2004 through 2023. The amended compacts and associated fiscal procedures agreements require that compact sector grants support the countries in six core sectors\u2014education, health, infrastructure, environment, private sector development, and public sector capacity building\u2014with priority given to the education and health sectors. These grants are described in section 211(a) of each compact and are referred to as compact sector grants or 211(a) grants. Section 211(b) of the RMI compact further states that the RMI must target a specified amount of grants to Ebeye and other Marshallese communities within Kwajalein Atoll. The RMI military use and operating rights agreement (MUORA) states that the Kwajalein- related funds provided to the RMI in the compacts shall be provided through fiscal year 2023 and thereafter for as long as this agreement remains in effect. The amended compacts and their subsidiary trust fund agreements provided that each trust fund is to be managed by a compact trust fund committee. Each compact trust fund committee includes representatives from both the United States and the respective country, but the terms of the trust fund agreements require the United States to hold the majority of votes. The Director of Interior\u2019s Office of Insular Affairs serves as the chair of each committee. Trust fund committee responsibilities include overseeing fund operation, supervision, and management; investing and distributing the fund\u2019s resources; and concluding agreements with any other contributors and other organizations. As part of this oversight, the committees are to establish an investment and distribution policy. The committees are also to determine fiscal procedures to be used in implementing the trust fund agreements on the basis of the fiscal procedures used for compact grant administration, unless otherwise agreed by the parties to the agreement. The U.S.\u2013FSM and U.S.\u2013RMI trust fund agreements allow for the agreements to be amended in writing at any time, with mutual consent of the governments. However, the U.S. legislation implementing the amended compacts requires that any amendment, change, or termination of all, or any part, of the compact trust fund agreements shall not enter into force until incorporated into an act of Congress. The compact trust fund agreements state that no funds, other than specified trust fund administrative expenses, may be distributed from the funds before October 1, 2023. From fiscal year 2024 onward, the maximum allowed disbursement from each compact trust fund is the amount of the fiscal year 2023 annual grant assistance, as defined by the trust fund agreement, with full inflation adjustment. In addition, the trust fund committees may approve additional amounts for special needs. The RMI compact trust fund agreement excludes Kwajalein-related assistance, defined in section 211(b) of the RMI compact, from the calculation of the allowed disbursement. Although the compact trust fund agreements state the maximum allowable disbursement level, they do not establish or guarantee a minimum disbursement level. Each country\u2019s compact trust fund consists of three interrelated accounts: the \u201cA\u201d account, the \u201cB\u201d account, and the \u201cC\u201d account. The A account is the trust fund\u2019s corpus and contains the initial, and any additional, U.S. and FSM or RMI contributions; contributions from other countries; and investment earnings. No funds, other than specified trust fund administrative expenses, may be disbursed from the A account. The B account is the trust fund\u2019s disbursement account and becomes active in fiscal year 2023. All income earned in 2023 will be deposited in the B account for possible disbursement in 2024. Each subsequent year\u2019s investment income will similarly be deposited in the B account for possible disbursement the following year. If there is no investment income, no funds will be deposited in the B account for possible disbursement the following year. The C account is the trust fund\u2019s buffer account. Through 2022, any annual income exceeding 6 percent of the fund balance is deposited in the C account. The size of the C account is capped at three times the amount of the estimated annual grant assistance in 2023, including estimated inflation. From 2023 onward, if annual income from the A account is less than the previous year\u2019s disbursement, adjusted for inflation, the C account may be tapped to address the shortfall. After 2023, any funds in the B account in excess of the amount approved for disbursement the following fiscal year are to be used to replenish the C account as needed, up to the maximum size of the account. If there are no funds in the C account and no prior-year investment income in the B account, no funds will be available for disbursement to the countries the following year. Figure 2 shows the compact trust fund account structure and associated rules. According to the U.S. trust fund agreements with the FSM and the RMI, contributions from other donors are permitted. In May 2005, Taiwan and the RMI reached an agreement that Taiwan would contribute a total of $40 million to the RMI\u2019s compact trust fund A account between 2004 and 2023. A \u201cD\u201d account may also be established to hold any contributions by the FSM and the RMI governments of revenue or income from unanticipated sources. According to the trust fund agreements, the D account must be a separate account, not mixed with the rest of the trust fund. Only the RMI has a D account, governed in part by the agreement between Taiwan and the RMI. The amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation incorporates, by reference, related agreements extending programs and services to the FSM and RMI. The programs and services agreement with each country identifies the following programs and services as being available to each country: U.S. postal services, weather services, civil aviation, disaster preparedness and response, and telecommunications. Each programs and services agreement extends for 20 years from the compact\u2019s entry into force. The agreement with the FSM ends on June 24, 2024, and the agreement with the RMI ends on April 30, 2024. The amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation (Pub. L. No. 108-188) and other U.S. legislation authorize other U.S. grants, programs, and services for the FSM and RMI. Pub. L. No. 108-188 authorizes an annual supplemental education grant (SEG) for the FSM and RMI in fiscal years 2005 through 2023, to be awarded in place of grants formerly awarded to the countries under several U.S. education, health, and labor programs. The FSM and RMI are not eligible for the programs replaced by the SEG during these years. Unlike the compact sector grants, the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation authorized the SEG but did not appropriate funds for it. Funding for the SEG is appropriated annually to the U.S. Department of Education (Education) and is transferred to Interior for disbursement. Other provisions of the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation, as well as other U.S. law, make the FSM and RMI eligible for a number of additional programs. As of fiscal year 2016, compact sector grants and the SEG, each of which end in 2023, supported a substantial portion of government expenditures in the FSM and RMI. Compact sector grants and the SEG supported about one-third of all FSM government expenditures. The four FSM states relied on these grants to a greater extent than did the FSM national government. In the RMI, compact sector grants and the SEG supported about one-quarter of all government expenditures. The expiration of the compacts\u2019 programs and services agreements in 2024 would also require the FSM and RMI to bear additional costs to provide services currently provided by the United States under the agreements. Compact sector grants, the SEG, and other U.S. grants supported almost half of FSM national and state government expenditures in fiscal year 2016. Compact sector and supplemental education grants that end in 2023 supported approximately one-third of total FSM national and state government expenditures in fiscal year 2016, while other U.S. grants supported an additional 15 percent of total FSM government expenditures (see fig. 3). In fiscal year 2016, compact sector and supplemental education grants that end in 2023 supported a larger proportion of FSM state governments\u2019 expenditures than of the FSM national government\u2019s expenditures. Compact sector grants and the SEG supported 8 percent of national government expenditures but supported 50 percent or more of each state\u2019s government expenditures. Among the FSM states, Chuuk, which has both the largest population and the lowest per-capita income in the FSM, had the highest percentage of expenditures supported by U.S. grants. (See table 2 for a summary of FSM national and state government expenditures supported by compact sector grants and the SEG and by other U.S. grants.) Compact sector and supplemental education grants that end in 2023 supported approximately 25 percent of the RMI\u2019s $123.5 million in government expenditures in fiscal year 2016, while other U.S. grants supported an additional 8 percent. Kwajalein-related compact grants that do not end in 2023 supported an additional 3 percent (see fig. 4). FSM and RMI budgets would be further affected if the countries assumed responsibility for providing programs and services currently provided by the United States. The following describes the status after 2023 of U.S. grants, programs, and services in the FSM and RMI under current law: Compact sector grants are scheduled to end in 2023, but the RMI MUORA extends the time frame of Kwajalein-related compact grants for as long as the MUORA is in effect. The SEG and additional grants identified in the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation are scheduled to end in 2023. Also, after fiscal year 2023, the FSM and RMI will no longer be eligible for some programs that the SEG replaced, including Head Start (early childhood education, health, and nutrition services for low-income children and their families). The compact-related programs and services agreements with each country will end in 2024. However, some U.S. agencies, such as the National Weather Service, Federal Aviation Administration, and U.S. Agency for International Development, may continue to provide programs and services similar to those provided in the agreement under other authorities. The FSM and RMI will generally remain eligible for other programs identified in the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation. These programs include U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Utilities Service grant and loan programs and U.S. Department of Education Pell grants for higher education and grants under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for children with disabilities. The FSM and RMI will remain eligible for additional programs we identified that have been provided under other current U.S. laws. Examples of these programs include USDA housing assistance programs and multiple public health, medical, and disease control and prevention grants provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. See appendix I for more information about the status after 2023 of U.S. grants, programs, and services in the FSM and RMI under current law. Our May 2018 projections for the compact trust funds showed that after fiscal year 2023, the funds are unlikely to provide maximum annual disbursements and may provide no disbursements at all in some years. The risk of disbursements below the maximum and the risk of zero disbursements increase over time for both funds. Potential strategies we analyzed in our May 2018 report would reduce or eliminate the risk of the compact trust funds\u2019 experiencing years of zero disbursement. However, all of the potential strategies would require the countries to exchange a near-term reduction in resources for more-predictable and more- sustainable disbursements in the longer term. Our May 2018 projections for the FSM and RMI compact trust funds after 2023 indicated that, given their balance at the end of fiscal year 2017 and current compact trust fund rules\u2014the baseline scenario\u2014the funds will be unable to provide maximum disbursements (equal to the inflation- adjusted amount of annual grant assistance in 2023) in some years and unable to provide any disbursement at all in some years, with the likelihood of zero disbursement in a given year increasing over time. The compact trust funds\u2019 C account\u2014designed as a buffer to protect disbursements from the B account in years when the funds do not earn enough to fund the disbursement\u2014could be exhausted by a series of years with low or negative annual returns. Since current rules do not allow disbursements from the compact trust fund corpus (the A account), exhaustion of the C account would result in zero disbursement in years when fund returns are zero or negative. Thus, there may be no funds available to disburse even if the funds\u2019 A accounts have a balance. As a result of low or zero disbursements, the countries could face economic and fiscal shocks and significant challenges in planning programs and budgets. Since we published our May 2018 report, an additional year of compact trust fund performance data and updated estimates of future inflation have become available; however, the updated information does not alter the conclusions we presented in May 2018. The updated data and inflation estimates change our model\u2019s assumptions about the current compact trust fund balance, size of future U.S. contributions to the FSM and RMI compact trust funds, annual grant assistance in fiscal year 2023, and C account balance\u2014each of which are relevant variables for our analysis. However, the updated variables would result in only slight changes to our 2018 report\u2019s projections of future compact trust fund performance presented in this testimony and do not alter our broader conclusions about future risks to the compact trust funds. FSM compact trust fund projections. In May 2018, our model projected that, given the baseline scenario and a 6 percent net return, the FSM compact trust fund will experience declining disbursements relative to the maximum allowable disbursements and an increasing chance of zero disbursements. (See app. I of GAO-18-415 for a full description of our methodology, and see app. V of GAO-18-415 for the baseline results with alternative net returns.) Projected disbursements. We projected that the FSM compact trust fund will, on average, be able to provide disbursements equal to 82 percent of the maximum allowable disbursement\u2014the inflation- adjusted amount of 2023 annual grant assistance\u2014in its first decade of disbursements. The likely average disbursement falls to 49 percent of the maximum in the next decade and falls further in subsequent decades. In addition, the amount available for disbursement may fluctuate substantially from year to year. Depending on the compact trust fund\u2019s performance in the previous year, disbursements may be higher or lower than the average amount if the balance in the C account is not sufficient to provide additional disbursements. Likelihood of providing zero disbursement. We projected a 41 percent likelihood that the FSM compact trust fund will be unable to disburse any funds in 1 or more years during the first decade of trust fund disbursements. This likelihood increases over time, rising to 92 percent in fiscal years 2054 through 2063. Figure 5 shows our May 2018 projections of the FSM compact trust fund\u2019s average disbursements as a percentage of maximum disbursement and the likelihood of 1 or more years of zero disbursement, given the baseline scenario and a 6 percent net return. We calculated the average disbursement as a percentage of the maximum allowable disbursement by averaging, over each 10-year period and over 10,000 simulated cases, the ratio of simulated disbursement to the maximum inflation-adjusted allowable disbursement in the given period. We calculated the likelihood of zero disbursement by counting cases with 1 or more years of zero disbursement in each of the given periods over 10,000 simulated cases. RMI compact trust fund projections. In May 2018, our model projected that, given the baseline scenario and a 6 percent net return, the RMI compact trust fund will experience declining disbursements relative to the maximum allowable disbursements and an increasing chance of zero disbursements. Projected disbursements. We projected that in its first decade of disbursements, the RMI compact trust fund will, on average, be able to provide disbursements nearly equal to the inflation-adjusted amount of 2023 annual grant assistance as defined by the trust fund agreement\u2014the maximum allowable. However, in each subsequent decade, the projected disbursements as a percentage of the maximum disbursements decline by about 10 percentage points. In addition, from year to year, the amount available to disburse may fluctuate substantially. Depending on the compact trust fund\u2019s performance in the previous year, disbursements may be higher or lower than the average amount if the balance in the C account is not sufficient to provide additional disbursements. Likelihood of providing zero disbursement. We projected a 15 percent likelihood that the RMI compact trust fund will be unable to disburse any funds in 1 or more years during the first decade of trust fund disbursements. This likelihood increases over time, rising to 56 percent in fiscal years 2054 through 2063. Figure 6 shows our May 2018 projections of the RMI compact trust fund\u2019s average disbursements as a percentage of maximum disbursement and its likelihood of 1 or more years of zero disbursement, given the baseline scenario and a 6 percent net return. We calculated the average disbursement as a percentage of the maximum allowable disbursement by averaging, over each 10-year period and over 10,000 simulated cases, the ratio of simulated disbursement to the maximum inflation-adjusted allowable disbursement in the given period. We calculated the likelihood of zero disbursement by counting cases with 1 or more years of zero disbursement in each of the given periods over 10,000 simulated cases. For our May 2018 report, we conducted a series of simulations to determine the likely effects of potential strategies for improving the outlook of the FSM and RMI compact trust funds. For example, we developed and analyzed potential strategies in which annual disbursements are reduced below the maximum allowable additional annual contributions are made to the trust fund prior to the end of fiscal year 2023; and the trust fund agreement disbursement policies are modified to limit the annual disbursement to a fixed percentage of the fund\u2019s moving average balance over the previous 3 years, up to the maximum disbursement amount defined by the current trust fund agreement. All of the potential strategies we analyzed would reduce or eliminate the risk of the compact trust funds experiencing years of zero disbursement. However, some of the potential strategies might require changing the trust fund agreements, and all of the potential strategies would require the countries to exchange a near-term reduction in resources for more- predictable and more-sustainable disbursements in the longer term. (See app. VII of our May 2018 report for detailed results of our analysis.) The compact trust fund committees have not taken the actions we recommended in 2018 to prepare for the 2023 transition to trust fund income. The committees have not yet prepared distribution policies, required by the trust fund agreements, which could assist the countries in planning for the transition to trust fund income. In addition, the committees have not established fiscal procedures for oversight of compact trust fund disbursements as required by the trust fund agreements. Further, the committees have not yet addressed a potential misalignment between the timing of their annual calculation of the amounts available to disburse and the FSM\u2019s and RMI\u2019s budget timelines, potentially complicating each country\u2019s planning and management. The compact trust fund committees have not yet developed, as the compact trust fund agreements require, policies to guide disbursements from the trust funds after fiscal year 2023. Under the agreements, each trust fund committee must develop a distribution policy, with the intent that compact trust fund disbursements will provide an annual source of revenue to the FSM and RMI after the scheduled end of compact grant assistance. The trust fund committees could use distribution policies to address risks to each fund\u2019s sustainability. For example, the committees have the discretion to disburse an amount below the established maximum. Our analysis of potential strategies for improving the funds\u2019 outlook shows that reducing the size of disbursements would improve each compact trust fund\u2019s long-term sustainability. Without a distribution policy that provides information about the size of expected disbursements, the FSM and RMI are hampered in their current and ongoing efforts to plan for the potential reduction in U.S. compact assistance after 2023. The compact trust fund committees have not yet established fiscal procedures for compact trust fund disbursements after fiscal year 2023. Each trust fund agreement requires the respective committee to determine the fiscal procedures to be used in implementing the trust fund agreement. The committees are to base their procedures on the compact fiscal procedures agreements, unless the parties to the trust fund agreement agree to adopt different fiscal procedures. No compact trust fund disbursements are to be made unless the committee has established such trust fund fiscal procedures. Without fiscal procedures in place, the trust fund committees will not be able to provide disbursements and the United States, the FSM, and the RMI will lack clear guidance to ensure oversight for trust fund disbursements. The timing for the compact trust fund committees\u2019 calculation of the amounts available for annual disbursement to the FSM and the RMI after fiscal year 2023 does not align with the countries\u2019 budget and planning timelines. The amounts available for disbursement in a given fiscal year cannot be determined until each fund\u2019s returns have been determined at the end of the prior year. Further, if the disbursement amounts are calculated from audited fund returns as determined by annual audits required by the trust fund agreements, the amounts may not be determined until as late as March 31, 6 months into the fiscal year for which the disbursement is to be provided. However, both the FSM and the RMI government budget cycles are completed before the annual amounts available for disbursement will be known. As a result, the FSM and RMI would have to budget without knowing the amount to be disbursed, complicating their annual budget and planning processes. The compact trust fund committees, chaired by Interior, have continued to discuss potential actions to address the recommendations in our May 2018 report. In May 2018, we made six recommendations to Interior\u2014 three parallel recommendations regarding each country\u2019s trust fund. We recommended that the Secretary of the Interior ensure that the Director of the Office of Insular Affairs work with other members of the trust fund committees to develop distribution policies, develop the fiscal procedures required by the compact trust fund address the timing of the calculation of compact trust fund disbursements. Interior concurred with our recommendations and has stated that it plans to implement them before the FSM and RMI transition to trust fund income in 2023. The FSM and RMI also concurred with our recommendations to Interior. According to the Trust Fund Administrator and Interior officials, the distribution policy was discussed at trust fund committee meetings convened since our May 2018 report. At their September 2019 meetings, the FSM and RMI compact trust fund committees did not make any decisions regarding steps to address our recommendations. The FSM\u2019s and RMI\u2019s transition to relying on income from the compact trust funds will likely require significant budgetary choices. However, the lack of trust fund distribution policies as well as the lack of alignment between the trust fund committees\u2019 annual disbursement calculations and the countries\u2019 budget cycles, hampers the countries\u2019 ability to plan for the transition. In addition, without the required fiscal procedures governing trust fund actions after 2023, the trust fund committees will be unable to make disbursements and the United States, the FSM, and the RMI will not have assurance of necessary oversight for trust fund disbursements. However, as of September 2019, Interior had not implemented our recommendations to address these issues. Further, while Interior has continued to discuss possible actions to address our recommendations with the trust fund committees, it targeted implementation of our recommendations for 2023. Chairmen Grijalva and Engel, Ranking Members Bishop and McCaul, and Members of the Committees, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have. If you or your staff have any questions about this testimony, please contact David Gootnick, Director, International Affairs and Trade, at (202) 512-3149 or gootnickd@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this statement. GAO staff who made key contributions to this testimony are Emil Friberg (Assistant Director), Ming Chen, Neil Doherty, Mark Dowling, Reid Lowe, Moon Parks, and Michael Simon. The amended compacts, compact\u2013related agreements, the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation, and other U.S. laws provide grants or eligibility for U.S. programs and services for the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). The amended compacts provide compact sector, Kwajalein-related, and audit grants. Under current law, compact sector and audit grants are each scheduled to end in 2023, but the RMI military use and operating rights agreement (MUORA) extends the time frame of Kwajalein-related compact grants for as long as the agreement is in effect. The amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation provides additional grants, including authorizing a supplemental education grant (SEG), and identifies several specific U.S. programs as available to the FSM and RMI. Under current law, the additional grants end in 2023, but the statutory authorizations for some programs identified in Pub. L. No. 108-188 provide for the continued eligibility of the FSM and RMI to receive benefits under the programs. However, after fiscal year 2023, the FSM and RMI will no longer be eligible under current U.S. law for some programs that the SEG replaced. The compact-related programs and services agreements with each country identify additional programs and services that the United States makes available to the FSM and RMI. While these agreements will end in 2024, under current law, some U.S. agencies may continue to provide programs and services similar to those provided in the agreement under other authorities. Based on the status of current law, the FSM\u2019s and RMI\u2019s eligibility for other programs we identified that have been provided under other current U.S. laws will not change after fiscal year 2023. Under current law, compact sector grants provided to the FSM and the RMI under section 211(a) of the amended compacts are scheduled to end in 2023. However, the RMI is scheduled to continue to receive $7.2 million, partially inflation adjusted, related to the U.S. military base in Kwajalein Atoll and provided under section 211(b) of its compact. Under the terms of the RMI MUORA, the United States agreed to provide these Kwajalein-related grants for as long as the MUORA is in effect. The MUORA continues until 2066 and may be extended at the discretion of the United States until 2086. The amended RMI compact provides for $18 million, partially inflation adjusted, in annual payments to the RMI government to compensate for impacts from the U.S. Army Garrison\u2013 Kwajalein Atoll. These payments will continue for as long as the MUORA is in effect. Annual compact grants of up to $500,000 (not inflation adjusted) to each country to pay for required annual audits of compact grants are scheduled to end in 2023. See table 3 for a summary of compact sector, Kwajalein-related, and audit grants. The supplemental education grant (SEG) authorized by the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation is scheduled to end in fiscal year 2023 and, under current law, FSM and RMI eligibility for most programs that the SEG replaced will not resume after fiscal year 2023. Absent changes to current law, the FSM and RMI will not be eligible after fiscal year 2023 for the following programs that the SEG replaced during fiscal years 2005 through 2023: U.S. elementary and secondary education grant programs, adult education and literacy programs, career and technical education programs, job training programs, and Head Start early education programs. However, under other provisions of current law, qualifying individuals in the FSM and RMI will be eligible after fiscal year 2023 for undergraduate education grants and work-study programs that the SEG replaced. See table 4. Although the programs and services agreements with the FSM and RMI will end in fiscal year 2024, current U.S. law enables U.S. agencies to continue providing some programs and services now provided under the agreements. After the agreements end, no current provisions of U.S. law will enable the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide disaster response funding, enable the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide deposit insurance, or enable the U.S. Postal Service to provide the services that it currently provides to the FSM and RMI. However, the National Weather Service, the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) could, under other legal authorities, provide services similar to those they now provide under the programs and services agreements. National Weather Service. The programs and services agreements authorize the National Weather Service to fund the operations of weather stations in the FSM and RMI, which it can continue to fund after the end of the agreements under other authorities, according to Department of Commerce officials. Federal Aviation Administration. The programs and services agreements authorize DOT\u2019s FAA to provide technical assistance in the FSM and RMI, which it can continue to provide after the end of the agreements under other provisions of current U.S. law. However, DOT officials stated that FAA would require new bilateral agreements with the FSM and the RMI in order for the countries to continue to receive the civil aviation safety services that FAA currently provides under the programs and services agreements. The FAA would also seek reimbursement for any technical assistance it provides to the FSM and RMI. With regard to the civil aviation economic services provided under the programs and services agreements, DOT officials stated that, while the FSM and RMI could voluntarily decide to allow U.S. air carriers to continue operations in the FSM and RMI, new bilateral agreements would be needed to assure that result. U.S. Agency for International Development. Following a U.S. presidential disaster declaration, FEMA provides the funding for disaster relief and reconstruction, which is programmed through USAID. Under current law, FEMA funds will no longer be available to the FSM and RMI for this purpose once the agreements end; however, USAID will be able to provide foreign disaster assistance funding to the two countries under the same terms as it provides this assistance to other countries. After the programs and services agreements end, FEMA will be able to support disaster relief efforts only if USAID or the countries request such support on a reimbursable basis. In addition, according to State and Interior officials, telecommunications- related services that the two agencies provide to the FSM and RMI under the programs and services agreements will continue as long as the FSM and RMI provide appropriate authorization for such services. Table 5 shows the status, under current law, of programs and services currently provided to the FSM and the RMI under the programs and services agreements after the agreements end in fiscal year 2024. Although additional grants provided to the FSM and the RMI under the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation will end in fiscal year 2023, the countries\u2019 eligibility for programs now provided under that legislation will generally continue under current U.S. law. Grants provided under the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation for (1) judicial training in the FSM and the RMI, and (2) agricultural and planting programs on the RMI\u2019s nuclear-affected Enewetak Atoll are scheduled to end. However, under current U.S. law, legal authorities permitting the operation of other programs will remain available to the FSM and RMI after fiscal year 2023. Eligibility under these legal authorities continues either because the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation does not specify an ending date or because other provisions in current U.S. law make the FSM and RMI eligible for the program. Programs provided in the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation include U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Utilities Service grant and loan programs; U.S. Department of Education Pell grants for higher education and grants under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for children with disabilities; programs for nuclear-affected areas in the RMI; and additional programs provided by the Departments of Commerce and Labor as well as law enforcement assistance provided by the U.S. Postal Service. See table 6 for a summary of the programs identified in the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation and their status as of the end of fiscal year 2023. In addition to being eligible for the programs provided through the compact, its associated agreements, and the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation, the FSM and RMI are also eligible for a number of programs under other provisions of current U.S. law. The FSM and RMI have each received funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for forestry and rural housing programs, multiple U.S. Department of Health and Human Services public health program grants, U.S. Department of the Interior technical assistance and historic preservation programs, and the DOT FAA airport improvement program, among others. Under current U.S. law, the legal authorities permitting the provision of these programs in the FSM and RMI would not necessarily change after 2023. Table 7 shows the FSM\u2019s and RMI\u2019s eligibility for these additional grants and programs under current law after fiscal year 2023.",
      "summary": "In 2003, the United States approved amended compacts of free association with the FSM and RMI, providing a total of $3.6 billion in economic assistance in fiscal years 2004 through 2023 and access to several U.S. programs and services. Compact grant funding, overseen by the Department of the Interior (Interior), generally decreases annually. However, the amount of the annual decrease in grants is added to the annual U.S. contributions to the compact trust funds, managed by joint U.S.\u2013FSM and U.S.\u2013RMI trust fund committees and chaired by Interior. Trust fund earnings are intended to provide a source of income after compact grants end in 2023. This testimony summarizes GAO's May 2018 report on compact grants and trust funds (GAO-18-415). In that report, GAO examined (1) the use and role of U.S. funds and programs in the FSM and RMI budgets, (2) projected compact trust fund disbursements, and (3) trust fund committee actions needed to address the 2023 transition to trust fund income. For this testimony, GAO also reviewed key variables for its trust fund model as of June 2019 to determine whether these variables had substantially changed. In addition, GAO reviewed the status of Interior's response to GAO's May 2018 recommendations. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) rely on U.S. grants and programs, including several that are scheduled to end in 2023. In fiscal year 2016, U.S. compact sector grants and supplemental education grants, both scheduled to end in 2023, supported a third of the FSM's expenditures and a quarter of the RMI's. Agreements providing U.S. aviation, disaster relief, postal, weather, and other programs and services are scheduled to end in 2024, but some U.S. agencies may provide programs and services similar to those in the agreements under other authorities. GAO's 2018 report noted that the FSM and RMI compact trust funds face risks and may not provide disbursements in some future years. GAO projected a 41 percent likelihood that the FSM compact trust fund would be unable to provide any disbursement in 1 or more years in fiscal years 2024 through 2033, with the likelihood increasing to 92 percent in 2054 through 2063. GAO projected a 15 percent likelihood that the RMI compact trust fund would be unable to provide any disbursement in 1 or more years in fiscal years 2024 through 2033, with the likelihood increasing to 56 percent in 2054 through 2063. Potential strategies such as reduced trust fund disbursements would reduce or eliminate the risk of years with no disbursement. However, some of these strategies would require changing the trust fund agreements, and all of the strategies would require the countries to exchange a near-term reduction in resources for more-predictable and more-sustainable disbursements in the longer term. Interior has not yet implemented the actions GAO recommended to prepare for the 2023 transition to trust fund income. The trust fund committees have not developed distribution policies, required by the agreements, which could assist the countries in planning for the transition to trust fund income. The committees have not developed the required fiscal procedures for oversight of disbursements or addressed differences between the timing of their annual determinations of the disbursement amounts and the FSM's and RMI's annual budget cycles. In its May 2018 report, GAO made three recommendations to Interior regarding each country's trust fund to address trust fund disbursement risks. Interior concurred with GAO's recommendations and has continued to discuss actions in response at trust fund committee meetings, with implementation targeted for 2023.",

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) During the so-called ``Lavender Scare'', at least 1,000 \n        people were wrongfully dismissed from the Department of State \n        for alleged homosexuality during the 1950s and well into the \n        1960s.\n            (2) According to the Department of State's Bureau of \n        Diplomatic Security, Department of State employees were forced \n        out of the Department on the grounds that their sexual \n        orientation ostensibly rendered them vulnerable to blackmail \n        and made them security risks.\n            (3) In addition to those wrongfully dismissed, many other \n        patriotic Americans were prevented from joining the Department \n        due to a screening process that was put in place to prevent the \n        hiring of those who, according to the findings of the Bureau of \n        Diplomatic Security, ``seemed like they might be gay or \n        lesbian''.\n            (4) Congress bears a special measure of responsibility as \n        the Department's actions were in part in response to \n        congressional investigations into ``sex perversion of Federal \n        employees'', reports on the employment of ``moral perverts by \n        Government Agencies'', hearings and pressure placed on the \n        Department through the appropriations process and congressional \n        complaints that Foggy Bottom was ``rampant with homosexuals who \n        were sympathetic to Communism and vulnerable to blackmail''.\n            (5) Between 1950 and 1969, the Department of State was \n        required to report on the number of homosexuals fired each year \n        as part of their annual appeals before Committees on \n        Appropriations.\n            (6) Although the worst effects of the ``Lavender Scare'' \n        are behind us, as recently as the early 1990s, the Department \n        of State's security office was investigating State personnel \n        thought to be gay and driving them out of government service as \n        ``security risks''.\n            (7) In 1994, Secretary of State Warren Christopher issued a \n        prohibition against discrimination in the Department of State, \n        including that based on sexual orientation.\n            (8) In 1998, President William Jefferson Clinton signed \n        Executive Order 13087 barring discrimination on the basis of \n        sexual orientation.\n            (9) On January 9, 2017, Secretary of State John Kerry \n        issued a statement regarding the ``Lavender Scare'', saying, \n        ``On behalf of the Department, I apologize to those who were \n        impacted by the practices of the past and reaffirm the \n        Department's steadfast commitment to diversity and inclusion \n        for all our employees, including members of the LGBTI \n        community.''.\n\nSEC. 3.

Each report shall include any comments or \nrecommendations for continued actions.\n\nSEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF RECONCILIATION BOARD.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of State shall establish, within \nthe Office of Civil Rights of the Department of State, an independent \nReconciliation Board to review the reports released by the Director \nGeneral of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Services under \nsection 3(b).\n    (b) Duties.--The Reconciliation Board shall--\n            (1) consistent with applicable privacy regulations, contact \n        all employees found to be fired due to the ``Lavender Scare'' \n        or, in the case of deceased former employees, the family \n        members of the employees, to inform them that their termination \n        from the Department of State has been deemed inappropriate and \n        that, if they wish, their employment record can be changed to \n        reflect these findings;\n            (2) designate a point of contact at a senior level position \n        within the Office of the Director General of the Foreign \n        Service and Director of Human Resources to receive oral \n        testimony of any employees or family members of deceased \n        employees mentioned in the report who personally experienced \n        discrimination and termination because of the actual or \n        perceived sexual orientation in order that such testimony may \n        serve as an official record of these discriminatory policies \n        and their impact on United States lives; and\n            (3) provide an opportunity for any former employee not \n        mentioned in the report to bring forth a grievance to the Board \n        if they believe they were terminated due to their sexual \n        orientation.\n    (c) Review of Claims.--\n            (1) In general.--The Board shall review each claim \n        described in subsection (b) within 150 days of receiving the \n        claim. Lack of paperwork may not be used as a basis for \n        dismissing any claims.\n            (2) Cooperation.--The Department of State shall be \n        responsible for producing pertinent information regarding each \n        claim to prove the employee was not wrongfully terminated.\n    (d) Termination.--The Board shall terminate 5 years after the date \nof the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF APOLOGY.\n\n    (a) Finding.--Secretary of State Kerry delivered the following \napology on January 9, 2017:\n    ``Throughout my career, including as Secretary of State, I have \nstood strongly in support of the LGBTI community, recognizing that \nrespect for human rights must include respect for all individuals. \nLGBTI employees serve as proud members of the State Department and \nvalued colleagues dedicated to the service of our country. For the last \nseveral years, the Department has pressed for the families of LGBTI \nofficers to have the same protections overseas as families of other \nofficers. In 2015, to further promote LGBTI rights throughout the \nworld, I appointed the first ever Special Envoy for the Human Rights of \nLGBTI Persons.\n    ``In the past--as far back as the 1940s, but continuing for \ndecades--the Department of State was among many public and private \nemployers that discriminated against employees and job applicants on \nthe basis of perceived sexual orientation, forcing some employees to \nresign or refusing to hire certain applicants in the first place. These \nactions were wrong then, just as they would be wrong today.\n    ``On behalf of the Department, I apologize to those who were \nimpacted by the practices of the past and reaffirm the Department's \nsteadfast commitment to diversity and inclusion for all our employees, \nincluding members of the LGBTI community.''\n    (b) Congressional Apology.--Congress hereby offers a formal apology \nfor its responsibility in encouraging the ``Lavender Scare'' and \nsimilar policies at the Department of State, as these policies were in \npart a response to congressional investigations into ``sex perversion \nof Federal employees'', reports on the employment of ``moral perverts \nby Government Agencies'', and hearings or pressure otherwise placed on \nthe Department of State through the appropriations process.\n\nSEC. 7. ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT EXHIBIT ON THE LAVENDER SCARE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of State shall work with the current \npublic-private partnership associated with the Department of State's \nnew United States Diplomacy Center to establish a permanent exhibit on \nthe ``Lavender Scare'' in the museum to assure that the history of this \nunfortunate episode is not brushed aside.\n    (b) Specifications.--The exhibit--\n            (1) shall be installed at the museum not later than one \n        year after the date of enactment of this Act;\n            (2) should provide access to the reports compiled by the \n        Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human \n        Resources under section 3(b); and\n            (3) shall readily display material gathered from oral \n        testimony received pursuant to section 5(b)(2) from employees \n        or family members of deceased employees who were subject to \n        these discriminatory policies during the ``Lavender Scare''.\n\nSEC. 8. GUIDANCE ON ISSUING VISAS.\n\n    To demonstrate the Department of State's commitment to ensuring \nfairness for current employees, not later than 100 days after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \nCongress a report on countries not issuing visas to the spouses of all \nForeign Service personnel posted overseas due to their sexual \norientation. This report shall include any comments or recommendations \nfor actions, including eliminating visa reciprocity with countries \nfound to be instituting these practices against the spouses of Foreign \nService personnel, that will lead to ensuring that all spouses of \nForeign Service personnel receive visas for the country their spouse is \nassigned, regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nSEC. 9. ESTABLISHMENT OF ADVANCEMENT BOARD.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of State shall establish, within \nthe Office of the Director General of the Department of State, a board \ncomprised of senior-level officials to address the issues faced by \nLGBTQI Foreign Service employees and their families.\n    (b) Hearing of Testimony.--The Advancement Board shall hear \ntestimony from any willing LGBTQI Foreign Service employees and their \nfamilies regarding any discrimination they have faced due to their \nsexual orientation.\n    (c) Report.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 100 days after completing \n        collection of testimony described under subsection (b), and \n        annually thereafter for 5 years, the Advancement Board shall \n        submit to Congress a report based on the testimony.\n            (2) Content.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall \n        include any comments or recommendations for continued actions \n        to improve the Department of State to ensure that no employee \n        or their family members experience discrimination due to their \n        sexual orientation.\n            (3) Privacy.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall \n        remain private and will only be accessible to Members of \n        Congress, their appropriate staff, and members of the \n        Advancement Board.",

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since the passage of SAFETEA-LU, Congress has \n        transferred over $50 billion from the General Fund to the \n        Highway Trust Fund, in order to maintain solvency.\n            (2) The Congressional Budget Office estimates after the end \n        of Fiscal year 2014, annual General Fund transfers of \n        approximately $15 billion will be necessary in order to \n        maintain current Highway Trust Fund spending levels.\n            (3) The Congressional Budget Office also estimates that in \n        order to provide funding for surface transportation projects \n        where the Federal benefit outweighs the cost, an additional $83 \n        billion a year would need to be allocated to the Highway and \n        Transit Trust Funds.\n            (4) The American Society for Civil Engineers estimates that \n        in order to meet our economic and transportation needs, the \n        United States should invest at least an additional $500 billion \n        in our surface transportation system by 2020.\n            (5) The National Commission on Fiscal Reform and \n        Responsibility report, often referred to as the ``Simpson-\n        Bowles'' plan, includes a recommendation to raise the gas tax \n        by fifteen cents.\n            (6) The National Surface Transportation Infrastructure \n        Financing Commission recommended, in their 2009 report, that \n        Congress take action to prevent the Highway Trust Fund from \n        becoming insolvent, and to avoid any reductions in \n        infrastructure spending. The Commission also noted that a \n        Federal funding system based on a vehicle miles traveled \n        system, is the consensus choice for the future.\n    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Replacement of Gas Tax.--It is the \nsense of Congress that by 2024 the gas tax should be repealed and \nreplaced with a more sustainable, stable funding source.\n\nSEC. 3.

      "document": "the saint louis university androgen deficiency in the aging male ( adam ) questionnaire is widely used to screen late - onset hypogonadism,1 it has a sensitivity of 72%88% , and has a specificity of 20%32% for androgen deficiency in chinese populations.2,3 due to its lack of specificity , it is not appropriate to be used as a surrogate to serum testosterone testing . however , self - tests on the adam questionnaire are available online . \n it is not uncommon in daily practice to see middle - aged or older male patients seek help for  andropause  , which is indicated by the adam questionnaire . \n nonetheless , the positive response to the adam questionnaire ( positive adam ) has been associated with depression and poorer health - related quality of life in a number of studies.47 the samples of the aforementioned studies include community - dwelling men and urological outpatients . to our knowledge , the adam questionnaire has not been investigated in psychiatric populations . like women , \n men experience an age - related decline of physical and mental capcity.8 aging male symptoms are of multifactorial origin , such as medical problems , mental disorders , testosterone levels , and androgen receptor polymorphism.9 a number of studies suggest that high aging male symptoms may be associated with depressive and anxiety disorders , alexithymia,911 and poor quality of life.12,13 in the present study , we aimed to determine the prevalence of positive adam among male psychiatric outpatients and to examine the association between positive adam and depression / anxiety as well as aging male symptoms , health - related quality of life ( hqol ) . \n we reanalyzed the data from the validation study of the chinese version of the aging males symptoms ( ams ) scale.14 in 2006 , we conducted a cross - sectional survey in the psychiatric clinic of chang gung memorial hospital , linkou , taiwan . \n this study was approved by the local institutional review board of chang gung memorial hospital . \n we recruited a convenience sample of 176 men ( mean age : 54.3 years ; standard deviation : 10.7 years ; range : 4080 years ) . \n the inclusion criteria were : 1 ) age 40 years or above ; 2 ) taiwan resident ; and 3 ) able to speak and understand mandarin . \n the exclusion criteria were : 1 ) history of psychotic , bipolar , and cognitive disorders ; 2 ) active substance use disorder ; 3 ) blindness , language or communication disorders ; and 4 ) receiving psychotropic agents . \n we recorded demographic information such as patients age , their spouse s age , education attainment , employment status , and marital status . both height and weight of the participants \n were measured to derive the body mass index ( bmi ) as weight ( in kg ) divided by the square of height ( in m ) . \n the adam questionnaire is a ten - item self - administered dichotomous scale.1 its ten items include decreased libido ; lack of energy ; reduced strength and/or endurance ; loss of height ; decreased enjoyment of life ; sadness / grumpiness ; erectile dysfunction ; deterioration of performance in sports and work ; and falling asleep after dinner . \n a positive adam is defined as a  yes  to decreased libido or erectile dysfunction , or to any three other symptoms . \n the validated chinese version has good internal consistency ( cronbach s  = 0.74 ) and test  retest reliability ( pearson s correlation coefficient r=0.86).15 the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) is a 14-item polychotomous scale that is widely used for assessment of anxiety and depression among medical patients and the general population.16,17 respondents rate each item in a four - point response category ( 03 : none = 0 ; mild = 1 ; moderate = 2 ; and severe = 3 ) , so the possible scores ranged from 0 to 21 for the anxiety subscale ( hads - a ) and 0 to 21 for the depression subscale ( hads -

a , hads - d , and ams than those with negative adam . \n positive adam was not associated with anxiety or depression , but was associated with moderate / severe impairment of hqol . \n table 2 shows the results of two sample t - tests with equal variance of the 17 ams items by the response to the adam questionnaire . with bonferroni correction , positive adam \n was associated with five items of the ams scale : ams1 ( decline of one s feeling of general well - being ) , ams11 ( depressive mood ) , ams15 ( decrease in ability / frequency to perform sexually ) , ams16 ( decrease in the number of morning erections ) , and ams17 ( decrease in sexual desire / libido ) . \n table 3 shows the results of logistic regression analysis of the moderate / severe impairment of hqol by the response to adam questionnaire , as well as by anxiety and depression . \n positive adam was associated with an unadjusted 20-fold risk and an adjusted 15-fold risk for moderate / severe impairment of hqol , independent of anxiety and depression . \n in this study , we showed a 93.2% prevalence of positive adam among male psychiatric outpatients of age 4080 years , which was comparable to73%80% in two multicenter studies in taiwan,2,3 87.8% in hong kong,20 77.6% in saudi arabia,21 and 81.3% in chile.22 with regard to the low specificity of the adam questionnaire , our results support that the adam questionnaire would be of little value for screening late - onset hypogonadism , particularly in samples with high prevalence of psychological symptoms.22 we showed an association of positive adam and a lower bmi , echoing pastuszak et al7 but liu et al showed no such association.23 as we did not record other indicators of obesity such as waist circumference , the association of bmi and the response to the adam questionnaire requires further validation . as was the case with lee et al20 positive adam \n was associated with a higher score on the ams and hads scales , indicating more symptomatic and poorer health - related quality of life . however , \n the adam questionnaire might not be suitable for screening of anxiety or depressive disorders . by using the ams scale \n , we showed that the symptomatology of positive adam was characterized by impaired well - being , depressed mood , and sexual complaints among psychiatric outpatients , consistent with the initial construct of the adam questionnaire.1 although the adam questionnaire contains items of decreased enjoyment of life and sadness / grumpiness , which may be present in anxiety or depressive disorders , our results support that the adam questionnaire would measure different phenomena compared with the hads . \n as the adam questionnaire has only ten dichotomous items and is easier to be completed than the ams scale , it might be suitable for screening sexual symptoms among psychiatric outpatients . \n we showed that positive adam was associated with moderate / severe impairment of hqol independently of clinically significant anxiety and depression . \n as shown in our previous study,24 assessment of anxiety and depression by the ams scale might be similar to assessment of anxiety and depression by the hads . \n clinicians would have to rule out anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with high ams scores . in this respect , \n the adam questionnaire would help identify cases who have a poor health - related quality of life and need intervention in addition to treatment for anxiety and depression.20 in particular , clinicians should explore sexual symptoms among patients who report positive adam . several limitations of the present study should be recognized . \n firstly , our results were cross - sectional and can not indicate change over time or causality . \n nonetheless , all three questionnaires used in our studies have good retest reliability.14,15,18 secondly , our study was based on a convenience sample comprised of outpatients with neurotic complaints , which was of course bound to be highly selective , and hence limited generalization from our data . \n our results also can not be applied to severely ill psychiatric patients , and it would not be appropriate to use questionnaires alone for assessment of severely ill patients . \n we did not perform diagnostic interviews such as the structured clinical interview for dsm - iv ( scid)25 to determine psychiatric diagnoses in the sample . nonetheless , as the hads has good sensivity and specificity for anxiety and depressive disorders,18 our results would not be considerably different whether using scid or not . \n furthermore , a dimensional approach of anxiety and depression has been suggested as more powerful and homogeneous than the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm - iv - tr ) category of anxiety and depression.26 fourthly , we did not record confounding factors of depression and anxiety such as perceived stress and suicidal ideation , which might also explain the association between positive adam and minor anxiety and depressive symptoms . \n but the association between positive adam and moderate / severe impairment of hqol was robust and independent of anxiety and depression . \n lastly , we did not perform hormone and medical workups as physical illness might be responsible for affective and somatic symptoms . nonetheless , the economic and technical constraints are common to clinical settings . \n the adam questionnaire can be used to screen sexual symptoms but not depression / anxiety in male psychiatric outpatients . \n positive adam may indicate moderate / severe impairment of hqol independent of anxiety and depression .",

      "document": "After his Syracuse Orange held No. 1 seed Indiana to just 50 points in upsetting the Hoosiers on Thursday and advancing to the Elite Eight, coach Jim Boeheim said, \u201cThis is one of our best defensive teams ever.\u201d He may just be right.\n\nHoops analyst Ken Pomeroy has, since Syracuse\u2019s title season in 2003, reported teams\u2019 adjusted defensive efficiency, an estimate of how many points they\u2019d allow per 100 possessions against the average Division I team. Syracuse is, by that measure, the eighth best defensive team in the country this year, allowing just 86.9 points per 100 possessions on an adjusted basis. Just four teams with better defensive ratings remain in the tournament, led by No. 1 overall seed Louisville, which won two of three meetings with Syracuse this season.\n\nSyracuse\u2019s zone defense nearly always makes the Orange one of the better defensive teams in the country, but for as long as Pomeroy has been ranking defenses, Syracuse\u2019s had never been as good as it is this year. Before this season, its best rank since 2003 was 16th, in 2011; its best defensive efficiency was 89, in 2010. This year, the Orange rank first in Div. I in block percentage, seventh in steal percentage, third in opponent three-point percentage and 28th in two-point field-goal percentage. In the last 11 years, those rankings are, respectively, tied for the best for a Syracuse team; third best; best; and fifth best. In lots of ways, this club is Boeheim\u2019s best defensively since 2003, if not throughout his tenure.\n\nSo why is Syracuse a No. 4 seed and not a No. 1? Because its offense isn\u2019t quite as good as its defense. Syracuse is scoring an adjusted 113.5 points per 100 possessions, good for 22nd best in the country and just seventh best among the 12 teams left in the tournament through Thursday. That\u2019s the worst offensive showing for a Syracuse team in six years.",

unpublished data ) . \n the present study found that capsaicin suppressed the pge2 production induced by lps in osteoblasts and suppressed lps - induced osteoclast formation ( figures 1 and 2 ) . \n these results indicate that osteoblasts are main target cells for trpv1 ligand in bone tissues and regulate osteoclast differentiation associated with inflammation . \n chen et al .   reported that capsaicin acts on the macrophage cell line raw264.7 to attenuate lps - induced cox-2 expression , but raw 264.7 cells do not express trpv1 . on the other hand , rossi et al . \n have shown that human mature osteoclasts express trpv1 isoforms and trpv1 agonist enhances the expression and the activity of trap and cathepsin k , two specific osteoclast biomarkers . \n the addition of capsaicin to bone marrow macrophages cultures in the presence of soluble rankl and macrophage colony stimulating factor ( m - csf ) does not influence osteoclast differentiation from macrophages ( miyaura and inada ; unpublished data ) . \n idris et al .   have shown that capsazepine , a trpv1 antagonist , acts on preosteoclasts and suppresses the differentiation into mature osteoclasts . \n therefore , the roles of trpv1 signals still remain controversial in macrophages , preosteoclasts , and mature osteoclasts . \n the current study showed that capsaicin significantly restored inflammatory bone loss in the femur induced by lps in mice ( figure 3 ) . \n therefore , trpv1 ligands possess potential as clinical drugs targeting bone diseases associated with inflammatory bone resorption . \n sancho et al .   reported that capsaicin has the potential to protect against inflammatory bowel diseases associated with severe inflammation , thus indicating the anti - inflammatory effects of trpv1 signal in intestinal diseases . \n idris et al .   reported that the trpv1 antagonist capsazepine inhibits bone loss due to estrogen deficiency in ovariectomized ( ovx ) mice . \n however , the mechanisms of bone loss in ovx animals differ from that in lps - treated animals accompanied with severe inflammation . in addition , clark et al . \n reported that trpv4 , a calcium permeable ion channel , possess chondroprotective role and deletion of trpv4 gene resulted in severe osteoarthritis using trpv4 knockout mice . \n further studies using several animal models for bone and cartilage diseases are needed to define the possible roles of trpvs signals in bone .",

defined swelling measuring 1  1 cm in the left supraclavicular region and ( b ) photograph of the scapular region shows a diffused swelling . \n ( a ) intraoral photograph shows swelling in the floor of mouth filling the entire floor of mouth ( arrow ) and a small swelling in the buccal mucosa that has a purplish hue ( small arrow ) . \n ( b ) intraoral photograph of the labial sulcus reveals a purplish swelling ( arrow ) . \n ultrasonography of the submandibular region showed a well - defined hypoechoic lesion having anechoic areas with septations , showing flow inside the lesion . \n ultrasonography of the submandibular region with 7 mhz small parts transducer shows heterogeneous hypoechoic lesion with slow flow and hyperechoic foci suggestive of calcifications ( arrow ) . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri)-t2-weighted fat suppression , post - contrast axial images showed hyperintense lesions , which are well - defined with no flow voids . \n all the lesions in the submandibular , cheek , and temple region had similar findings [ figure 5 ] . \n direct puncture phlebogram of the left frontal scalp region revealed pooling of contrast into cavernous spaces draining into external jugular vein [ figure 6 ] . \n ( a ) axial section at the submandibular region shows well - defined hyperintense lesion ( arrow ) in the floor of mouth . \n ( b ) axial section at the level of cheek shows well - defined hyperintense lesion in the cheek region ( arrow ) . \n phlebography of the lesion in the temple region shows filling of the entire lesion and draining to the regional area ( arrow ) . \n histopathological examination revealed several thin - walled venous channels lined by flattened endothelium , supported by a dense uninflamed fibrous connective tissue stroma . \n hematoxylin and eosin stained specimen ( 40 ) shows irregular venous channels ( large arrow ) lined by thin endothelium . \n venous malformation ( vm ) is the second most common vascular anomaly of the head and neck after hemangioma . \n venous malformations can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently seen in the head and neck ( 40% ) , extremities ( 40% ) , and trunk ( 20% ) . \n vms are slow - flow vascular anomalies composed of ectatic venous channels that will continue to grow throughout the patient 's lifetime . \n they grow slowly in size with age , but their growth may be exacerbated following trauma , sepsis , or hormonal changes and they do not regress spontaneously . both men and women are equally affected . \n vascular malformations are believed to be the result of a congenital error of vascular morphogenesis that occurs between the 4 and 10 weeks of intrauterine life . \n vascular malformations have a quiescent endothelium and are considered to be localized defects of vascular morphogenesis , likely to be caused by dysfunction in pathways regulating embryogenesis and vasculogenesis . \n these lesions vary in color depending on depth of involvement and range from mild detectable color change to deep purple color . \n these lesions fill when the patient is standing and are compressible , which helps to distinguish them from lymphatic malformations on physical examination . \n areas frequently involved in the head and neck region are masseter , temporalis , tongue musculature , as well as oral and airway mucosa . \n soft tissue lesions are most frequently facial in location , with the buccal region being the most common site followed by the mandibular space , sublingual space , tongue , and orbit . \n intraosseous calvarial involvement is most frequent in the frontoparietal region and the mandible is the most frequent location within the facial skeleton . \n there may , however , be no visible manifestations with deeper lesions . in our case , \n the first anatomopathologic classification of vascular lesions based on the microscopic appearance was developed by virchow and wegner . \n mulliken and glowacki ( 1982 ) developed a biological classification of vascular anomalies that included physical findings , clinical behavior , and cellular kinetics and classified them as hemangiomas and vms . \n a more recently updated classification of vascular anomalies by international society for the study of vascular anomalies is now widely used [ table 1 ] . \n classification of vascular anomalies ( issva 2007 ) plain radiographs have limited role in the investigations as they can identify only phleboliths . \n ultrasound ( us ) is often the initial investigation to evaluate vascular malformations and it may characterize and define the extent of more superficial lesions . on gray - scale imaging , venous malformations can appear as hypoechoic or heterogenous lesions with anechoic structures visible in 50% of cases . \n in addition , the doppler flow is generally monophasic low velocity flow , and in some cases flow is only discernible with compression and release of the lesion . \n they typically appear as isointense or hypointense lesions on t1-weighted images , but could be hyperintense depending on the presence of intralesional fat . \n lesions are typically lobulated , which gives them the characteristic  bunch of grapes  configuration . septations and rounded signal voids corresponding to phleboliths are additional distinguishing features . in t2-weighted or inversion recovery sequences , \n vms demonstrate high - signal intensity.this imaging modality is used to determine the full extent of the lesion and its relationship to adjacent vital structures . \n gradient echo sequences reveal areas of low signal corresponding to calcification or hemosiderin or thrombosis . \n t1-weighted post contrast imaging demonstrates homogenous or heterogeneous enhancement , and dynamic contrast - enhanced mri has increased the specificity of venous malformation diagnosis . \n vms are best demonstrated by direct phlebography , which fills the sinusoidal spaces and any anomalous veins , allowing assessment of the size and extent of the lesion . in the present study , phleboliths were seen on plain radiography and us features were suggestive of vascular anomaly with slow flow rate . whereas , the mri features were suggestive of venous malformation , which was confirmed by direct phlebography where the lesion was seen draining the regional vein . \n venous malformations usually are associated with syndromes like proteus syndrome and blue rubber bleb nevus ( bean ) syndrome . \n multiple treatment options exist for venous malformations , including conservative measures such as head of bed elevation and compression , laser therapy , sclerotherapy , and surgery . \n conservative management of venous malformations is usually reserved for smaller isolated asymptomatic lesions and is also important in controlling the growth and symptoms . \n elevation of the head of the bed is important as it decrease hydrostatic pressure in the malformation , which can lead to expansion and can also decrease symptoms of airway obstruction , swelling , and pain that are experienced . \n sclerotherapy remains a good option for the treatment of venous malformations in the head and neck . \n sclerotherapy involves percutaneous injection of a substance to induce inflammation and thrombosis of the lesion , which then will lead to more long - term fibrosis and hopefully decrease or eliminate the expansion of the lesion . \n sotradecol foam or ethibloc ( glue ) , or the sclerosant is mixed with fibrin glue or ethyl cellulose , bleomycin ( pingyangmycin ) and picibanil ( ok-432 ) have recently been used as sclerosants in asia with promising results . \n large cervicofacial venous malformations present a much greater challenge , and one must be prepared to use multimodal therapy to keep the lesion under control . \n these lesions generally can not be cured as doing so would leave devastating functional and cosmetic results . \n therefore , therapy is used to control growth , maintain cosmesis , and decrease symptoms . \n venous malformations are either superficial or deep veins that are abnormally formed and dilated . a thorough examination and investigation of the condition is needed to establish the exact extension of the condition and plan proper treatment .",
      "summary": "vascular malformations are congenital lesions that are present at birth and do not regress \n . however , they often present later in life . \n they are subdivided into two categories : ( 1 ) slow- or low - flow and ( 2 ) fast- or high - flow malformations . \n low - flow malformations contain combinations of capillary , venous , and lymphatic components . \n venous malformations can occur anywhere in the body , but are most frequently seen in the head and neck ( 40% ) . \n these lesions present in a variety of ways , from a vague blue patch to a soft blue mass , which may be single isolated or may occur in multiple areas . \n treatment depends on the type of lesion , the location , degree of involvement , and the clinical symptoms . \n here we are report the imaging and histopathologic findings in a patient with multiple venous malformations affecting the left side of the face and trunk .",

old primigravida with no known co - morbids presented to one of the secondary setups of a university hospital at 35 weeks of gestation , with a history of fever for 5 days and threatened preterm labor . \n initial blood reports [ table 1 ] were normal along with normal liver function tests and negative screening for hepatitis , typhoid , and malaria . \n a baby girl of 2.8 kg was delivered by emergency lower segment cesarean section as tocolysis failed to delay labor . \n excessive bleeding per vaginum and hematuria was observed in the postanesthesia care unit , but she remained hemodynamically stable . \n oxytocin infusion was continued , four units packed cells and four units fresh frozen plasma ( ffp ) were transfused , and she was referred to the tertiary setup in anticipation of need for admission to the surgical icu ( sicu ) . on admission to the sicu , she was hypotensive ( blood pressure of 104/64 ) and tachycardic ( heart rate of 140/min ) but fully conscious . \n blood counts are shown in table 1 , and dengue serology was reported as positive . pharmacological measures ( oxytocin infusion 40 iu in 500 ml normal saline at 100 ml / h and misoprostol 800 g ) and balloon tamponade failed to control heavy per vaginal bleeding , and \n there was no structural or vascular injury , but the uterus was found to be atonic . \n b -

spectrum antibiotics . \n a chest computed tomography after discharge from icu showed pulmonary embolism which was initially managed by heparin anticoagulation and later by warfarin . \n she also developed right sided leg weakness and pain which was diagnosed as acute right plexopathy on nerve conduction studies . \n she remained in the special care ward for another 6 days and was discharged home when she was afebrile , tolerated a regular diet , and mobilized with support . \n in addition , to the obstetrics and gynecology , she required follow - up by general surgery for wound management , chronic pain service for leg pain , and hematology for anticoagulation surveillance . \n severe dengue should be considered if the patient is from an area of dengue risk presenting with fever of 27 days and evidence of plasma leakage , significant bleeding , and severe gi involvement , altered level of consciousness , or severe organ impairment . \n diagnosis of dengue is difficult during pregnancy because the physiologic changes of pregnancy mask the pathognomonic features of severe dengue such as increased hematocrit , thrombocytopenia , and leucopenia . \n this patient had a normal white cell count , platelet count and hematocrit on presentation and thrombocytopenia was observed later [ table 1 ] . \n immunoglobulin m ( igm ) ( elisa ) is a widely used , simple and rapid method to detect dengue specific igm antibodies and should have been part of the initial workup of fever in this patient . \n conservative obstetrical management is preferred in women with dengue infections , but the incidence of cesarean deliveries is between 44% ( case reports ) and 20.4% ( case series ) . \n there are case reports of cesarean deliveries complicated by hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony and thrombocytopenia with variable outcome and the variable need for blood product transfusion . \n our patient received a transfusion of 36 units packed cells ( red cell concentrate ) , 44 units ffp , 49 units of platelets , nine single donor platelet mega units , and 20 units of cryoprecipitate during her hospital stay . \n she also received two doses of activated factor vii , as a last resort before hysterectomy was considered . \n the potential for thrombotic complications is known with the use of factor vii and this patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism after discharge from icu and may have resulted from activated factor vii use . \n who recommends that all patients with severe dengue should be admitted to a hospital with access to intensive care facilities and blood transfusion . \n icu admission may be required to manage thrombocytopenia ( < 20,000/mm ) , systemic inflammatory response or severe sepsis , severe bleeding , respiratory distress , hepatitis or jaundice , altered sensorium , shock , severe dehydration , or decreased urine output , and the associated mortality reported is 6.1% . \n hemodynamic monitoring and support , massive transfusion of various blood products , need for mechanical ventilation , and management of unanticipated problems required an icu stay of 16 days in this patient . \n as the incidence of dengue is rising among adults more cases of dengue fever are being reported during pregnancy and dengue serology should be part of the workup of unexplained fever in pregnancy in the endemic areas . \n surgical intervention in patients with suspected severe dengue should be undertaken cautiously , and early referral to healthcare centers where technical , transfusion and intensive care facilities are available may prove lifesaving . \n  \n  \n ",

SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Higher Education \nAccrediting Agency Responsibility Act of 2002''.\n    (b) References to Higher Education Act of 1965.--Except as \notherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or \nrepeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \nsection or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be \nmade to a section or other provision of the Higher Education Act of \n1965.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Accrediting agencies were originally intended to \n        provide voluntary, nongovernmental oversight of institutions of \n        higher education.\n            (2) However, Congress has allowed accreditors to become \n        gatekeepers of more than $40,000,000,000 of Federal student aid \n        funds due to such agencies role, enshrined in current Federal \n        law, to help determine an institution's eligibility to \n        participate in Federal student aid programs.\n            (3) More effective and less costly mechanisms are already \n        in place to protect students and parents, as no institution can \n        receive Federal funds until the Department of Education \n        certifies its financial and administrative capacity. \n        Additionally, the amount of useful information publicly \n        available about the quality of academic institutions has grown \n        dramatically in recent years and now far exceeds the minimal \n        amount conveyed by the accreditation system.\n            (4) It is virtually unknown for an institution to be denied \n        accreditation because of low educational values, despite \n        growing public concern that American college graduates are \n        lacking the skills necessary for participation in civic life.\n            (5) The time and effort required of institutions of higher \n        education to comply with the accreditation process imposes \n        costs which must ultimately be borne by students and parents.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To refocus the purpose of accreditation on providing \n        comparative information about the quality of institutions of \n        higher education, rather than determining student aid \n        eligibility, which should properly be the responsibility of the \n        Department of Education.\n            (2) To end the virtual monopoly that today's accrediting \n        agencies enjoy, and require them to operate in a competitive \n        environment like any other industry.\n\nSEC. 3.

a variable number of tandem repeat ( vntr ) in intron 2 , called stin2 ; and a snp polymorphism in the noncoding 3-utr . \n in fact , 5-httlpr has been studied thoroughly , but the effect and function of stin2 vntr is not yet clear . it has been proved to include 10-repeat and 12-repeat alleles of a 16/17 bp element in all ethnicities , and the rare 9-repeat allele appears only in people of european or african descent . \n stin2 vntr works as a transcriptional regulator , and the transcriptional activity is determined by the number of repeats , with the stin2.12 having the highest expression . \n many studies had linked vntr with disorders such as depression , bipolar depression , and a predisposition to obsessive compulsive disorder . \n although many studies have explored slc6a4 and lpe [ 2428 ] , only 1 of them studied stin2 vntr , and there have been no such studies in chinese populations . \n considering the important role of the serotonergic system in ejaculatory function , we aimed to determine whether stin2 vntr is related to lpe in china . \n each participant was informed of the purpose of the study and signed the informed consent . \n the initial evaluation of each subject completed a detailed face - to - face interview by an andrologist , including a questionnaire and physical examination . \n finally , 115 patients with lpe were recruited by referral from the andrology outpatient clinic . at the same time , \n subjects had to meet the following inclusion criteria : ( i ) heterosexual male patient aged 2060 years ;

      "document": "socio - cultural factors are important in the epidemiology and psychopathology of various psychiatric disorders12 including factitious ones . \n they have an influence on the pathways to seeking medical help.3 in addition , illness behavior has cultural overtones in arab patients.4 factitious disorders are characterized by physical , and psychological signs or symptoms that are intentionally produced with no external incentives to feign illness.5 these disorders have been reported from various cultures.67 a distinction should be made between factitious disorders and malingering . in the latter , the patient produces symptoms with an obvious goal . in factitious disorders , the motivation to be a patient is vague and obscure . \n munchausen 's syndrome , in its classic description , is an uncommon subtype of factitious disorder which has received great attention.78 this syndrome is the earliest description of a factitious disorder with predominantly physical signs and symptoms . \n although factitious disorders are common among males , recent reviews indicated a preponderance of female patients.9 the probable judgement that a particular symptom is produced intentionally is made both by direct evidence and with the exclusion of other causes of the symptoms . almost in all reported cases of factitious disorders with physical symptoms , \n however , many such patients have been described as having underlying masochistic , borderline or dependent personality traits.9 although the prognosis is usually poor , patients who have adequate psychosocial support with less severe personality pathology can do better . in this article , \n a 45-year - old , illiterate , saudi housewife was referred from a medical ward for psychiatric consultation . during her stay in the medical ward , \n she was investigated for skin lesions distributed mainly on the abdomen and both thighs , but not on her back or other areas of the body inaccessible to the hand . \n her case history revealed that two years prior to her current psychiatric consultation , she was hospitalized for vague abdominal pain , but all investigations were normal . \n after discharge from the hospital , she consulted a traditional healer who treated her by cauterization . during the following two years \n , she presented with recurrent skin lesions on the abdomen , arms and both thighs . \n her illness had created marital discord but there was no family history of mental illness . \n the examination of the mental state did not show any major disorder . during her stay in the psychiatric ward for observation , \n evidence of intentional production of skin lesions on healed sites and on new areas was reported . \n when confronted with evidence of their factitious nature , she denied doing herself any harm . \n the judgement that the skin lesions were produced intentionally was made by direct evidence from the staff in the ward and by excluding other causes of these lesions . \n she was discharged from the psychiatric ward after three months and given a follow - up appointment in the psychiatric clinic but she never showed up . \n a 39-year - old , single , illiterate and unemployed saudi male presented with dramatic severe abdominal pain . \n he was vague and inconsistent when questioned in detail about the nature of the pain . \n when all of the investigations proved negative , he started to complain of chest pain . \n his past history showed that he had been admitted to different general hospitals in saudi arabia , some of which were far from his hometown . \n the information received from some of these hospitals showed that repeated medical and surgical consultations , including extensive investigations , did not reveal any physical disorder . \n in addition , psychiatric assessment showed no evidence of mental disorders either . during his stay in the psychiatric unit , he presented with acute renal pain , hematuria and evidence of self - induced blood tinged stool . \n on confronting the patient about the factitious nature of his complaints after organic causes had been ruled out , he became angry and discharged himself . \n two months later , he presented to the hospital in a deaf - mute state but left the hospital when again confronted . similarly \n , he did not benefit from traditional healers whom he had visited many times , on the advice of his relatives . \n one of the essential clinical features of the above two cases is the intentional production of physical symptoms . \n the first case is that of factitious dermatosis , the second is of chronic physical symptoms associated with multiple hospitalizations . \n the first case of dermatitis artefacta was preceded by cauterization from a traditional healer which might have acted as a predisposing factor . \n the second case is similar in presentation to other classic cases of munchausen 's syndrome10 described in several cultures . \n it is important for clinicians to remember that with factitious disorder there could be some real physical illnesses that need appropriate management.11 the behavior of these two patients has cultural dimensions . to travel \n , females in the saudi culture need  mahram  ( a person whom they can not legally marry ) who might not always be available.12 this requirement restricts their travel creates an important feature of what was known as wandering type of munchausen 's syndrome.13 in females , the type of munchausen 's syndrome that is characterized by less severe psychopathology , a higher functioning level and less frequent factitious behavior is classified as non - prototypical.14 this classification seems to be justified as revealed in case 1 , though it has recently been criticized8 because the criteria for classification are not applicable in a good number of factitious disorder cases . \n new modern hospitals are common in saudi arabia . for submissive female and male patients , falling sick \n this might be incorporated into the psychopathology of factitious disorders in saudi culture . in spite of socio - cultural factors , it is clear that doctors awareness and acceptance of the possibility of factitious disorders is a prerequisite to making the diagnosis . \n once factitious disorder is diagnosed , it is important to confront the patient but remain supportive . \n confrontation should be carefully planned . in saudi culture , it would be inappropriate to inform the relatives that the patient is feigning the symptoms , since this may precipitate psychotic breakdown of the patient . \n interestingly , both patients consulted traditional healers during their factitious behavior . although consulting traditional healers could be explained partially by the religious background of the saudi culture , \n it is interesting that in spite of the modern treatment available in saudi arabia , patients including those with factitious disorder , still consult traditional healers with their somatic and psychological symptoms .",
      "summary": "factitious disorders are characterized by physical or psychological manifestations that are intentionally produced or feigned with no apparent external incentives in order to assume the sick role . \n these disorders are rarely reported or may be under - reported in saudi patients . \n we describe here two male and female saudi cases of such disorders . both presented predominantly with features of munchausen 's syndrome . \n like most psychiatric patients both had sought help from traditional healers prior to their reporting to the hospitals . \n inspite of the socio - cultural factors , it is clear that doctors awareness and acceptance of the possibility of factitious disorders is a prerequisite to making the diagnosis .",

FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Price stability is a prerequisite for sustainable long-\n        term economic growth, job creation, and moderate interest \n        rates.\n            (2) Inflation erodes the value of Americans' income and \n        savings.\n            (3) Inflation distorts the pricing system and the efficient \n        allocation of resources in the economy.\n            (4) Inflation makes long-term planning difficult and raises \n        the effective tax rate on capital, thereby impeding investment.\n            (5) Through its determination of monetary policy, the Board \n        of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is ultimately \n        responsible for controlling the long-run rate of inflation in \n        the economy.\n            (6) The multiple policy goals of the Full Employment and \n        Balanced Growth Act of 1978 cause confusion and ambiguity about \n        the appropriate role and aims of monetary policy, which can add \n        to volatility in economic activity and financial markets.\n            (7) There is a need for the Congress to clarify the proper \n        role of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in \n        economic policymaking, in order to achieve the best environment \n        for long-term economic growth and job creation.\n            (8) An explicit price stability goal would promote \n        transparency, accountability and credibility in monetary \n        policy.\n            (9) Price stability should be the primary long-term goal of \n        the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States \nthat--\n            (1) the principal economic responsibilities of the \n        Government are to establish and ensure an environment that is \n        conducive to both long-term economic growth and increases in \n        living standards, by establishing and maintaining free markets, \n        low taxes, respect for private property, and the stable, long-\n        term purchasing power of the United States currency; and\n            (2) the primary long-term goal of the Board of Governors of \n        the Federal Reserve System should be to promote price \n        stability.\n\nSEC. 3. MONETARY POLICY.\n\n    (a) Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act.--Section 2A of the \nFederal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 225a) is amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 2A.

      "document": "The FSM and RMI are independent countries about 3,000 miles southwest of Hawaii. The FSM is a federation of four semiautonomous states\u2014Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap\u2014whose population and income vary widely. Chuuk, the largest state by population, has the lowest per-capita gross domestic product (GDP). Overall, the FSM had a 2016 population of approximately 102,000 and a GDP per capita of about $3,200. The RMI\u2019s 2016 population was approximately 54,000 with a GDP per capita of about $3,600. The RMI\u2019s most recent census, in 2011, found that approximately three-quarters of the population lived in Majuro, the nation\u2019s capital, and on the island of Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll. Table 1 shows the FSM\u2019s, FSM states\u2019, and RMI\u2019s estimated populations and annual GDP per capita in fiscal year 2016. U.S. relations with the FSM and the RMI began during World War II, when the United States ended Japanese occupation of the region. Starting in 1947, the United States administered the region under a United Nations trusteeship. In 1986, after a period of negotiations, the United States entered into a compact of free association with the FSM and RMI that provided for economic assistance to the two countries, secured U.S. defense rights, and allowed FSM and RMI citizens to migrate to the United States. In 2003, after a period of negotiations, the United States approved separate amended compacts with the FSM and the RMI that went into effect on June 25, 2004, and May 1, 2004, respectively. The amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation authorized and appropriated direct financial assistance to the FSM and the RMI in fiscal years 2004 through 2023, with the base amounts decreasing in most years. The legislation also provided for partial inflation adjustment of the base amount of compact sector grants and trust fund contributions each year. As the base amount of compact sector grants decreases, the trust fund contributions generally increase by an equivalent amount. Because the annual inflation adjustment is less than full inflation, the value of compact sector grants declines in real terms. Figure 1 shows the amount of compact sector grants and trust fund contributions each fiscal year from 2004 through 2023. The amended compacts and associated fiscal procedures agreements require that compact sector grants support the countries in six core sectors\u2014education, health, infrastructure, environment, private sector development, and public sector capacity building\u2014with priority given to the education and health sectors. These grants are described in section 211(a) of each compact and are referred to as compact sector grants or 211(a) grants. Section 211(b) of the RMI compact further states that the RMI must target a specified amount of grants to Ebeye and other Marshallese communities within Kwajalein Atoll. The RMI military use and operating rights agreement (MUORA) states that the Kwajalein- related funds provided to the RMI in the compacts shall be provided through fiscal year 2023 and thereafter for as long as this agreement remains in effect. The amended compacts and their subsidiary trust fund agreements provided that each trust fund is to be managed by a compact trust fund committee. Each compact trust fund committee includes representatives from both the United States and the respective country, but the United States is required by the terms of the trust fund agreements to hold the majority of votes on each committee. The Director of Interior\u2019s Office of Insular Affairs serves as the chair of each committee. Trust fund committee responsibilities include overseeing fund operation, supervision, and management; investing and distributing the fund\u2019s resources; and concluding agreements with any other contributors and other organizations. As part of this oversight, the committees are to establish an investment and distribution policy. The committees are also to determine fiscal procedures to be used in implementing the trust fund agreements on the basis of the fiscal procedures used for compact grant administration, unless otherwise agreed by the parties to the agreement. The U.S.\u2013FSM and U.S.\u2013RMI trust fund agreements allow for the agreements to be amended in writing at any time, with mutual consent of the governments. However, the U.S. legislation implementing the amended compacts requires that any amendment, change, or termination of all, or any part, of the compact trust fund agreements shall not enter into force until incorporated into an act of Congress. The compact trust fund agreements state that no funds, other than specified trust fund administrative expenses, may be distributed from the funds before October 1, 2023. From fiscal year 2024 onward, the maximum allowed disbursement from each compact trust fund is the amount of the fiscal year 2023 annual grant assistance, as defined by the trust fund agreement, with full inflation adjustment. In addition, the trust fund committees may approve additional amounts for special needs. The RMI compact trust fund agreement excludes Kwajalein-related assistance, defined in section 211(b) of the RMI compact, from the calculation of the allowed disbursement. Although the compact trust fund agreements state the maximum allowable disbursement level, they do not establish or guarantee a minimum disbursement level. Each country\u2019s compact trust fund consists of three interrelated accounts: the \u201cA\u201d account, the \u201cB\u201d account, and the \u201cC\u201d account. The A account is the trust fund\u2019s corpus and contains the initial, and any additional, U.S. and FSM or RMI contributions; contributions from other countries; and investment earnings. No funds, other than specified trust fund administrative expenses, may be disbursed from the A account. The B account is the trust fund\u2019s disbursement account and becomes active in fiscal year 2023. All income earned in 2023 will be deposited in the B account for possible disbursement in 2024. Each subsequent year\u2019s investment income will similarly be deposited in the B account for possible disbursement the following year. If there is no investment income, no funds will be deposited in the B account for possible disbursement the following year. The C account is the trust fund\u2019s buffer account. Through 2022, any annual income exceeding 6 percent of the fund balance is deposited in the C account. The size of the C account is capped at three times the amount of the estimated annual grant assistance in 2023, including estimated inflation. From 2023 onward, if annual income from the A account is less than the previous year\u2019s disbursement, adjusted for inflation, the C account may be tapped to address the shortfall. After 2023, any funds in the B account in excess of the amount approved for disbursement the following fiscal year are to be used to replenish the C account as needed, up to the maximum size of the account. If there are no funds in the C account and no prior-year investment income in the B account, no funds will be available for disbursement to the countries the following year. Figure 2 shows the compact trust fund account structure and associated rules. According to the U.S. trust fund agreements with the FSM and the RMI, contributions from other donors are permitted. In May 2005, Taiwan and the RMI reached an agreement that Taiwan would contribute a total of $40 million to the RMI\u2019s compact trust fund A account between 2004 and 2023. A \u201cD\u201d account may also be established to hold any contributions by the FSM and the RMI governments of revenue or income from unanticipated sources. According to the trust fund agreements, the D account must be a separate account, not mixed with the rest of the trust fund. Only the RMI has a D account, governed in part by the agreement between Taiwan and the RMI. The amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation incorporates, by reference, related agreements extending programs and services to the FSM and RMI. The programs and services agreement with each country identifies the following programs and services as being available to each country: U.S. postal services, weather services, civil aviation, disaster preparedness and response, and telecommunications. Each programs and services agreement extends for 20 years from the compact\u2019s entry into force. The agreement with the FSM ends on June 24, 2024, and the agreement with the RMI ends on April 30, 2024. The amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation (Pub. L. No. 108-188) and other U.S. legislation authorize other U.S. grants, programs, and services for the FSM and RMI. Pub. L. No. 108-188 authorized an annual supplemental education grant (SEG) for the FSM and RMI in fiscal years 2005 through 2023, to be awarded in place of grants formerly awarded to the countries under several U.S. education, health, and labor programs. The FSM and RMI are not eligible for the programs replaced by the SEG during these years. Unlike the compact sector grants, the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation authorized the SEG but did not appropriate funds for it. Funding for the SEG is appropriated annually to the U.S. Department of Education (Education) and is transferred to Interior for disbursement. Other provisions of the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation, as well as other U.S. law, make the FSM and RMI eligible for a number of additional programs. As of fiscal year 2016, compact sector grants and the SEG, each of which end in 2023, supported a substantial portion of government expenditures in the FSM and RMI. Compact sector grants and the SEG supported about one-third of all FSM government expenditures. The four FSM states relied on these grants to a greater extent than the FSM national government does. In the RMI, compact sector grants and the SEG supported about one-quarter of all government expenditures. The end of the compacts\u2019 programs and services agreements in 2024 would also require the FSM and RMI to bear additional costs to provide services currently provided by the United States under the agreements. Compact sector grants, the SEG, and other U.S. grants supported almost half of FSM national and state government expenditures in fiscal year 2016. Compact sector and supplemental education grants that end in 2023 supported approximately one-third of total FSM national and state government expenditures in fiscal year 2016, while other U.S. grants supported an additional 15 percent of total FSM government expenditures (see fig. 3). While the supplemental education grant ends in 2023, the FSM would be eligible for some of the programs that the supplemental education grant replaced after 2023. A small number of other U.S. grants also end in 2023. See GAO-19-648T, app. I, for a discussion of grants and programs that do and do not end in 2023. In fiscal year 2016, compact sector and supplemental education grants that end in 2023 supported a larger proportion of FSM state governments\u2019 expenditures than of the FSM national government\u2019s expenditures. Compact sector grants and the SEG supported 8 percent of national government expenditures but supported 50 percent or more of each state\u2019s government expenditures. Among the FSM states, Chuuk, which has both the largest population and the lowest per-capita income in the FSM, had the highest percentage of expenditures supported by U.S. grants. (See table 2 for a summary of FSM national and state government expenditures supported by compact sector grants and the SEG and by other U.S. grants.) Compact sector and supplemental education grants that end in 2023 supported approximately 25 percent of the RMI\u2019s $123.5 million in government expenditures in fiscal year 2016, while other U.S. grants supported an additional 8 percent. Kwajalein-related compact grants that do not end in 2023 supported an additional 3 percent (see fig. 4). While the supplemental education grant ends in 2023, the RMI would be eligible for some of the programs that the supplemental education grant replaced after 2023. A small number of other U.S. grants also end in 2023. See GAO-19-648T, app. I, for a discussion of grants and programs that do and do not end in 2023. FSM and RMI budgets would be further affected if the countries assumed responsibility for providing programs and services currently provided by the United States. The following describes the status after 2023 of U.S. grants, programs, and services in the FSM and RMI under current law: Compact sector grants are scheduled to end in 2023, but the RMI MUORA extends the time frame of Kwajalein-related compact grants for as long as the MUORA is in effect. The SEG and additional grants identified in the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation are scheduled to end in 2023. Also, after fiscal year 2023, the FSM and RMI will no longer be eligible for some programs that the SEG replaced, including Head Start (early childhood education, health, and nutrition services for low-income children and their families). The compact-related programs and services agreements with each country will end in 2024. However, some U.S. agencies, such as the National Weather Service, Federal Aviation Administration, and U.S. Agency for International Development, may continue to provide programs and services similar to those provided in the agreement under other authorities. The FSM and RMI will generally remain eligible for other programs identified in the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation. These programs include U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Utilities Service grant and loan programs and U.S. Department of Education Pell grants for higher education and grants under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for children with disabilities. The FSM and RMI will remain eligible for additional programs we identified that have been provided under other current U.S. laws. Examples of these programs include USDA housing assistance programs and multiple public health, medical, and disease control and prevention grants provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. See appendix I for more information about the status after 2023 of U.S. grants, programs, and services in the FSM and RMI under current law. Our May 2018 projections for the compact trust funds showed that after fiscal year 2023, the funds are unlikely to provide maximum annual disbursements and may provide no disbursements at all in some years. The risk of disbursements below the maximum and the risk of zero disbursements increase over time for both funds. Potential strategies we analyzed in our May 2018 report would reduce or eliminate the risk of the compact trust funds\u2019 experiencing years of zero disbursement. However, all of the potential strategies would require the countries to exchange a near-term reduction in resources for more-predictable and more- sustainable disbursements in the longer term. Our May 2018 projections for the FSM and RMI compact trust funds after 2023 indicated that, given their balance at the end of fiscal year 2017 and current compact trust fund rules\u2014the baseline scenario\u2014the funds will be unable to provide maximum disbursements (equal to the inflation- adjusted amount of annual grant assistance in 2023) in some years and unable to provide any disbursement at all in some years, with the likelihood of zero disbursement in a given year increasing over time. The compact trust funds\u2019 C account\u2014designed as a buffer to protect disbursements from the B account in years when the funds do not earn enough to fund the disbursement\u2014could be exhausted by a series of years with low or negative annual returns. Since current rules do not allow disbursements from the compact trust fund corpus (the A account), exhaustion of the C account would result in zero disbursement in years when fund returns are zero or negative. Thus, there may be no funds available to disburse even if the funds\u2019 A accounts have a balance. As a result of low or zero disbursements, the countries could face economic and fiscal shocks and significant challenges in planning programs and budgets. Since we published our May 2018 report, an additional year of compact trust fund performance data and updated estimates of future inflation have become available; however, the updated information does not alter the conclusions we presented in May 2018. The updated data and inflation estimates change our model\u2019s assumptions about the current compact trust fund balance, size of future U.S. contributions to the FSM and RMI compact trust funds, annual grant assistance in fiscal year 2023, and C account balance\u2014each of which are relevant variables for our analysis. However; the updated variables would result in only slight changes to our 2018 report\u2019s projections of future compact trust fund performance presented in this testimony and do not alter our broader conclusions about future risks to the compact trust funds. FSM compact trust fund projections. In May 2018, our model projected that, given the baseline scenario and a 6 percent net return, the FSM compact trust fund will experience declining disbursements relative to the maximum allowable disbursements and an increasing chance of zero disbursements. (See app. I of GAO-18-415 for a full description of our methodology, and see app. V of GAO-18-415 for the baseline results with alternative net returns.) Projected disbursements. We projected that the FSM compact trust fund will, on average, be able to provide disbursements equal to 82 percent of the maximum allowable disbursement\u2014the inflation- adjusted amount of 2023 annual grant assistance\u2014in its first decade of disbursements. The likely average disbursement falls to 49 percent of the maximum in the next decade and falls further in subsequent decades. In addition, the amount available for disbursement may fluctuate substantially from year to year. Depending on the compact trust fund\u2019s performance in the previous year, disbursements may be higher or lower than the average amount if the balance in the C account is not sufficient to provide additional disbursements. Likelihood of providing zero disbursement. We projected a 41 percent likelihood that the FSM compact trust fund will be unable to disburse any funds in 1 or more years during the first decade of trust fund disbursements. This likelihood increases over time, rising to 92 percent in fiscal years 2054 through 2063. Figure 5 shows our May 2018 projections of the FSM compact trust fund\u2019s average disbursements as a percentage of maximum disbursement and the likelihood of 1 or more years of zero disbursement, given the baseline scenario and a 6 percent net return. RMI compact trust fund projections. In May 2018, our model projected that, given the baseline scenario and a 6 percent net return, the RMI compact trust fund will experience declining disbursements relative to the maximum allowable disbursements and an increasing chance of zero disbursements. Projected disbursements. We projected that in its first decade of disbursements, the RMI compact trust fund will, on average, be able to provide disbursements nearly equal to the inflation-adjusted amount of 2023 annual grant assistance as defined by the trust fund agreement\u2014the maximum allowable. However, in each subsequent decade, the projected disbursements as a percentage of the maximum disbursements decline by about 10 percentage points. In addition, from year to year, the amount available to disburse may fluctuate substantially. Depending on the compact trust fund\u2019s performance in the previous year, disbursements may be higher or lower than the average amount if the balance in the C account is not sufficient to provide additional disbursements. Likelihood of providing zero disbursement. We projected a 15 percent likelihood that the RMI compact trust fund will be unable to disburse any funds in 1 or more years during the first decade of trust fund disbursements. This likelihood increases over time, rising to 56 percent in fiscal years 2054 through 2063. Figure 6 shows our May 2018 projections of the RMI compact trust fund\u2019s average disbursements as a percentage of maximum disbursement and its likelihood of 1 or more years of zero disbursement, given the baseline scenario and a 6 percent net return. For our May 2018 report, we conducted a series of simulations to determine the likely effects of potential strategies for improving the outlook of the FSM and RMI compact trust funds. For example, we developed and analyzed potential strategies in which: annual disbursements are reduced below the maximum allowable additional annual contributions are made to the trust fund prior to the end of fiscal year 2023, and the trust fund agreement disbursement policies are modified to limit the annual disbursement to a fixed percentage of the fund\u2019s moving average balance over the previous 3 years, up to the maximum disbursement amount defined by the current trust fund agreement. All of the potential strategies we analyzed would reduce or eliminate the risk of the compact trust funds experiencing years of zero disbursement. However, some of the potential strategies may require changing the trust fund agreements and all of the potential strategies would require the countries to exchange a near-term reduction in resources for more- predictable and more-sustainable disbursements in the longer term. (See app. VII of our May 2018 report for detailed results of our analysis.) The trust fund committees have not taken the actions we recommended in 2018 to prepare for the 2023 transition to trust fund income. The compact trust fund committees have not yet prepared distribution policies, required by the trust fund agreements, which could assist the countries in planning for the transition to trust fund income. In addition, the committees have not established fiscal procedures for oversight of compact trust fund disbursements as required by the trust fund agreements. Further, the committees have not yet addressed a potential misalignment between the timing of their annual calculation of the amounts available to disburse and the FSM\u2019s and RMI\u2019s budget timelines, potentially complicating each country\u2019s planning and management. The compact trust fund committees have not yet developed, as the compact trust fund agreements require, policies to guide disbursements from the trust funds after fiscal year 2023. Under the agreements, each trust fund committee must develop a distribution policy, with the intent that compact trust fund disbursements will provide an annual source of revenue to the FSM and RMI after the scheduled end of compact grant assistance. The trust fund committees could use distribution policies to address risks to each fund\u2019s sustainability. For example, the committees have the discretion to disburse an amount below the established maximum. Our analysis of potential strategies for improving the funds\u2019 outlook shows that reducing the size of disbursements would improve each compact trust fund\u2019s long-term sustainability. Without a distribution policy that provides information about the size of expected disbursements, the FSM and RMI are hampered in their current and ongoing efforts to plan for the potential reduction in U.S. compact assistance after 2023. The compact trust fund committees have not yet established fiscal procedures for compact trust fund disbursements after fiscal year 2023. Each trust fund agreement requires the respective committee to determine the fiscal procedures to be used in implementing the trust fund agreement. The committees are to base their procedures on the compact fiscal procedures agreements, unless the parties to the trust fund agreement agree to adopt different fiscal procedures. No compact trust fund disbursements are to be made unless the committee has established such trust fund fiscal procedures. Without fiscal procedures in place, the trust fund committees will not be able to provide disbursements and the United States, the FSM, and the RMI will lack clear guidance to ensure oversight for trust fund disbursements. The timing for the trust fund committees\u2019 calculation of the amounts available for annual disbursement to the FSM and the RMI after fiscal year 2023 does not align with the countries\u2019 budget and planning timelines. The amounts available for disbursement in a given fiscal year cannot be determined until each fund\u2019s returns have been determined at the end of the prior year. Further, if the disbursement amounts are calculated from audited fund returns as determined by annual audits required by the trust fund agreements, the amounts may not be determined until as late as March 31, 6 months into the fiscal year for which the disbursement is to be provided. However, both the FSM and the RMI government budget cycles are completed before the annual amounts available for disbursement will be known. As a result, the FSM and RMI would have to budget without knowing the amount to be disbursed, complicating their annual budget and planning processes. The trust fund committees, chaired by Interior, have discussed potential actions to address the recommendations in our May 2018 report. In May 2018, we made six recommendations to Interior\u2014three parallel recommendations regarding each country\u2019s trust fund. We recommended that the Secretary of the Interior ensure that the Director of the Office of Insular Affairs work with other members of the trust fund committees to: develop distribution policies, develop the fiscal procedures required by the compact trust fund address the timing of the calculation of compact trust fund disbursements. Interior concurred with our recommendations and has stated that it plans to implement them before the FSM and RMI transition to trust fund income in 2023. The FSM and RMI also concurred with our recommendations to Interior. According to the Trust Fund Administrator and Interior officials, the distribution policy was discussed at subsequent trust fund committee meetings\u2014including the most recent, in May 2019. According to the trust fund administrator, trust fund representatives met with FSM and RMI representatives in January 2019 to discuss the status of the trust fund and future scenarios for its management. Interior officials further stated that discussions about trust fund policies and controls were frequent and ongoing among committee members and staffers as well as the trust fund manager and investment advisers. The FSM\u2019s and RMI\u2019s transition to relying on income from the compact trust funds will likely require significant budgetary choices. However, the lack of trust fund distribution policies, and the lack of alignment between the trust fund committees\u2019 annual disbursement calculations and the countries\u2019 budget cycles hamper the countries\u2019 ability to plan for the transition. In addition, without the required fiscal procedures governing trust fund actions after 2023, the trust fund committees will be unable to make disbursements and the United States, the FSM, and the RMI will not have assurance of necessary oversight. However, as of June 2019, Interior had not implemented our recommendations to address these issues. Further, while Interior has continued to discuss possible actions to address our recommendations with the trust fund committees, it targeted implementation of our recommendations for 2023. Chairwoman Murkowski, Ranking Member Manchin, and Members of the Committee, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have. If you or your staff have any questions about this testimony, please contact David Gootnick, Director, International Affairs and Trade, at (202) 512-3149 or gootnickd@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this statement. GAO staff who made key contributions to this testimony are Emil Friberg (Assistant Director), Ming Chen, Neil Doherty, Mark Dowling, Christopher Keblitis, Reid Lowe, Moon Parks, and Michael Simon. The amended compacts, compact\u2013related agreements, the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation, and other U.S. laws provide grants or eligibility for U.S. programs and services for the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). The amended compacts provide compact sector, Kwajalein-related, and audit grants. Under current law, compact sector and audit grants are each scheduled to end in 2023, but the RMI military use and operating rights agreement (MUORA) extends the time frame of Kwajalein-related compact grants for as long as the agreement is in effect. The amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation provides additional grants, including authorizing a supplemental education grant (SEG), and identifies several specific U.S. programs as available to the FSM and RMI. Under current law, the additional grants end in 2023, but the statutory authorizations for some programs identified in Pub. L. No. 108-188 provide for the continued eligibility of the FSM and RMI to receive benefits under the programs. However, after fiscal year 2023, the FSM and RMI will no longer be eligible under current U.S. law for some programs that the SEG replaced. The compact-related programs and services agreements with each country identify additional programs and services that the United States makes available to the FSM and RMI. While these agreements will end in 2024, under current law, some U.S. agencies may continue to provide programs and services similar to those provided in the agreement under other authorities. Based on the status of current law, the FSM\u2019s and RMI\u2019s eligibility for other programs we identified that have been provided under other current U.S. laws will not change after fiscal year 2023. Under current law, compact sector grants provided to the FSM and the RMI under section 211(a) of the amended compacts are scheduled to end in 2023. However, the RMI is scheduled to continue to receive $7.2 million, partially inflation adjusted, related to the U.S. military base in Kwajalein Atoll and provided under section 211(b) of its compact. Under the terms of the RMI MUORA, the United States agreed to provide these Kwajalein-related grants for as long as the MUORA is in effect. The MUORA continues until 2066 and may be extended at the discretion of the United States until 2086. The amended RMI compact provides for $18 million, partially inflation adjusted, in annual payments to the RMI government to compensate for impacts from the U.S. Army Garrison\u2013 Kwajalein Atoll. These payments will continue for as long as the MUORA is in effect. Annual compact grants of up to $500,000 (not inflation adjusted) to each country to pay for required annual audits of compact grants are scheduled to end in 2023. See table 3 for a summary of compact sector, Kwajalein-related, and audit grants. The supplemental education grant (SEG) authorized by the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation is scheduled to end in fiscal year 2023 and, under current law, FSM and RMI eligibility for most programs that the SEG replaced will not resume after fiscal year 2023. Absent changes to current law, the FSM and RMI will not be eligible after fiscal year 2023 for the following programs that the SEG replaced during fiscal years 2005 through 2023: U.S. elementary and secondary education grant programs, adult education and literacy programs, career and technical education programs, job training programs, and Head Start early education programs. However, under other provisions of current law, qualifying individuals in the FSM and RMI will be eligible after fiscal year 2023 for undergraduate education grants and work-study programs that the SEG replaced. See table 4. Although the programs and services agreements with the FSM and RMI will end in fiscal year 2024, current U.S. law enables U.S. agencies to continue providing some programs and services now provided under the agreements. After the agreements end, no current provisions of U.S. law will enable the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide disaster response funding, enable the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide deposit insurance, or enable the U.S. Postal Service to provide the services that it currently provides to the FSM and RMI. However, the National Weather Service, the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) could, under other legal authorities, provide services similar to those they now provide under the programs and services agreements. National Weather Service. The programs and services agreements authorize the National Weather Service to fund the operations of weather stations in the FSM and RMI, which it can continue to fund after the end of the agreements under other authorities, according to Department of Commerce officials. Federal Aviation Administration. The programs and services agreements authorize DOT\u2019s FAA to provide technical assistance in the FSM and RMI, which it can continue to provide after the end of the agreements under other provisions of current U.S. law. However, DOT officials stated that FAA would require new bilateral agreements with the FSM and the RMI in order for the countries to continue to receive the civil aviation safety services that FAA currently provides under the programs and services agreements. The FAA would also seek reimbursement for any technical assistance it provides to the FSM and RMI. With regard to the civil aviation economic services provided under the programs and services agreements, DOT officials stated that, while the FSM and RMI could voluntarily decide to allow U.S. air carriers to continue operations in the FSM and RMI, new bilateral agreements would be needed to assure that result. U.S. Agency for International Development. Following a U.S. presidential disaster declaration, FEMA provides the funding for disaster relief and reconstruction, which is programmed through USAID. Under current law, FEMA funds will no longer be available to the FSM and RMI for this purpose once the agreements end; however, USAID will be able to provide foreign disaster assistance funding to the two countries under the same terms as it provides this assistance to other countries. After the programs and services agreements end, FEMA will be able to support disaster relief efforts only if USAID or the countries request such support on a reimbursable basis. In addition, according to State and Interior officials, telecommunications- related services that the two agencies provide to the FSM and RMI under the programs and services agreements will continue as long as the FSM and RMI provide appropriate authorization for such services. Table 5 shows the status after the programs and services agreements end of programs and services currently provided to the FSM and the RMI under the agreements. Although additional grants provided to the FSM and the RMI under the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation will end in fiscal year 2023, the countries\u2019 eligibility for programs now provided under that legislation will generally continue under current U.S. law. Grants provided under the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation for (1) judicial training in the FSM and the RMI, and (2) agricultural and planting programs on the RMI\u2019s nuclear-affected Enewetak Atoll are scheduled to end. However, under current U.S. law, legal authorities permitting the operation of other programs will remain available to the FSM and RMI after fiscal year 2023. Eligibility under these legal authorities continues either because the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation does not specify an ending date or because other provisions in current U.S. law make the FSM and RMI eligible for the program. Programs provided in the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation include U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Utilities Service grant and loan programs; U.S. Department of Education Pell grants for higher education and grants under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for children with disabilities; programs for nuclear-affected areas in the RMI; and additional programs provided by the Departments of Commerce and Labor as well as law enforcement assistance provided by the U.S. Postal Service. See table 6 for a summary of the programs identified in the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation and their status as of the end of fiscal year 2023. In addition to being eligible for the programs provided through the compact, its associated agreements, and the amended compacts\u2019 implementing legislation, the FSM and RMI are also eligible for a number of programs under other provisions of current U.S. law. The FSM and RMI have each received funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for forestry and rural housing programs, multiple U.S. Department of Health and Human Services public health program grants, U.S. Department of the Interior technical assistance and historic preservation programs, and the DOT FAA airport improvement program, among others. Under current U.S. law, the legal authorities permitting the provision of these programs in the FSM and RMI would not necessarily change after 2023. Table 7 shows the FSM\u2019s and RMI\u2019s eligibility for these additional grants and programs under current law after fiscal year 2023.",
      "summary": "In 2003, the United States approved amended compacts of free association with the FSM and RMI, providing a total of $3.6 billion in economic assistance in fiscal years 2004 through 2023 and access to several U.S. programs and services. Compact grant funding, overseen by the Department of the Interior (Interior), generally decreases annually. However, the amount of the annual decrease in grants is added to the annual U.S. contributions to the compact trust funds, managed by joint U.S.-FSM and U.S.-RMI trust fund committees and chaired by Interior. Trust fund earnings are intended to provide a source of income after compact grants end in 2023. This testimony summarizes GAO's May 2018 report on compact grants and trust funds ( GAO-18-415 ). In that report, GAO examined (1) the use and role of U.S. funds and programs in the FSM and RMI budgets, (2) projected compact trust fund disbursements, and (3) trust fund committee actions needed to address the 2023 transition to trust fund income. For this testimony, GAO also reviewed key variables for its trust fund model as of June 2019 to determine whether these variables had substantially changed. In addition, GAO reviewed the status of Interior's response to GAO's May 2018 recommendations. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) rely on U.S. grants and programs, including several that are scheduled to end in 2023. In fiscal year 2016, U.S. compact sector grants and supplemental education grants, both scheduled to end in 2023, supported a third of the FSM's expenditures and a quarter of the RMI's. Agreements providing U.S. aviation, disaster relief, postal, weather, and other programs and services are scheduled to end in 2024, but some U.S. agencies may provide programs and services similar to those in the agreements under other authorities. GAO's 2018 report noted that the FSM and RMI compact trust funds face risks and may not provide disbursements in some future years. GAO projected a 41 percent likelihood that the FSM compact trust fund would be unable to provide any disbursement in 1 or more years in fiscal years 2024 through 2033, with the likelihood increasing to 92 percent in 2054 through 2063. GAO projected a 15 percent likelihood that the RMI compact trust fund would be unable to provide any disbursement in 1 or more years in fiscal years 2024 through 2033, with the likelihood increasing to 56 percent in 2054 through 2063. Potential strategies such as reduced trust fund disbursements would reduce or eliminate the risk of years with no disbursement. However, some of these strategies would require changing the trust fund agreements, and all of the strategies would require the countries to exchange a near-term reduction in resources for more-predictable and more-sustainable disbursements in the longer term. Interior has not yet implemented the actions GAO recommended to prepare for the 2023 transition to trust fund income. The trust fund committees have not developed distribution policies, required by the agreements, which could assist the countries in planning for the transition to trust fund income. The committees have not developed the required fiscal procedures for oversight of disbursements or addressed differences between the timing of their annual determinations of the disbursement amounts and the FSM's and RMI's annual budget cycles. In its May 2018 report, GAO made three recommendations to Interior regarding each country's trust fund to address trust fund disbursement risks. Interior concurred with GAO's recommendations and discussed actions in response at subsequent trust fund committee meetings, with implementation targeted for 2023.",

      "document": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Local Zoning Preservation Act of \n1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \n        preserved local zoning authority over decisions regarding the \n        placement, construction and modification of personal wireless \n        service facilities, except that (A) the zoning application must \n        be acted upon within a reasonable amount of time; (B) the \n        decision must be in writing and be supported by substantial \n        evidence; (C) the decision must not be based on concerns about \n        the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions from \n        facilities; and (D) the State or locality must not discriminate \n        among personal wireless service providers.\n            (2) State and municipal zoning decisions traditionally have \n        been afforded virtually complete deference by Federal courts. \n        Issues of land use are distinctly local and therefore fall on \n        the State-side of the federalism divide.\n            (3) When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of \n        1996, it anticipated the need for and proliferation of personal \n        wireless service facilities. Congress, however, included the \n        provisions on the preservation of local zoning authority \n        because it also realized the need to protect State and local \n        authority to regulate the placement, construction, and \n        modification of these facilities, with few limitations.\n            (4) The limitations in the Act have forced States and \n        localities into needless litigation regarding denials of \n        facility applications. In some cases, the courts have \n        misinterpreted the intent of the limitations in the Act on \n        State and local authority, forcing many States and localities \n        to approve applications for construction of unsightly mammoth \n        personal wireless service towers in their community.\n            (5) Many residents of States and local towns have expressed \n        concerns about the impact of personal wireless facilities and \n        towers on property values, aesthetics, and the character of \n        local communities.\n            (6) Many localities have refused to approve personal \n        wireless service facility applications in response to citizen \n        concerns about the facility and tower impacts on property \n        values, aesthetics, and character of the community.\n            (7) A specific limitation included in the section \n        332(c)(7)(B)(iii) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended \n        by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, provides that any \n        decision by a state or local government to deny a request to \n        place, construct, or modify personal wireless service \n        facilities shall be in writing and supported by ``substantial \n        evidence'' contained in the written record. The conference \nreport for the Telecommunications Act of 1996 defined ``substantial \nevidence contained in the written record'' as the traditional standard \nused for judicial review of agency actions--more than a scintilla of \nevidence but less than a preponderance.\n            (8) Denials of these personal wireless service facility \n        applications have led to litigation in Federal courts, \n        sometimes resulting in federal judges overturning local zoning \n        board decisions.\n            (9) The Federal courts are split on what constitutes \n        ``substantial evidence'' to uphold a local zoning board's \n        decision to deny a permit for construction, placement, or \n        modification of personal wireless service facility.\n            (10) Some Federal courts have refused to acknowledge \n        citizen concerns about aesthetics or a decline in property \n        value as legitimate reasons for denying a personal wireless \n        service facility application, holding that such concerns do not \n        constitute ``substantial evidence''. See, e.g., APT \n        Minneapolis, Inc. v. City of Maplewood, 1998 WL 634224, at *5 \n        (D. Minn. Aug. 12, 1998) (concluding that ``[c]ourts construing \n        the TCA have universally held that general aesthetic \n        considerations fail to meet the substantial evidence test''); \n        Omnipoint Communications Enterprises, Inc. v. Town of Amherst, \n        N.H., Civil No. 97-614-JD (D. N.H. Aug. 21, 1998) (stating that \n        ``[a]lthough aesthetic considerations may be properly taken \n        into account by local governments in some circumstances, they \n        cannot be used to exclude PWS towers entirely'').\n            (11) Other Federal courts, however, have held that local \n        residents' concerns about the personal wireless service \n        facility's impact on aesthetics of the community constitute \n        ``substantial evidence''. See, e.g., Cellular Telephone Co., v. \n        Town of Oyster Bay, 1999 WL 35195, at *7 (2d Cir. Jan. 29, \n        1999) (concluding that ``aesthetics qualify as a permissible \n        ground for denial of a permit only if we can conclude that \n        there was `more than a scintilla' of evidence . . . before the \n        [Zoning] Board on the negative visual impact of the cell \n        cites''); AT&T Wireless PCS, Inc. v. City Council of the City \n        of Virginia Beach, 155 F.3d 423, 427-28 (4th Cir. 1998) \n        (concluding that testimony from citizens ``demonstrating \n        concerns about the aesthetics of the towers and their \n        incompatibility with the residential character'' of the \n        community ``is more than enough to demonstrate the real, and \n        surely reasonable, concerns animating the democratically \n        elected'' city council's decision).\n            (12) To provide the courts better guidance the \n        Telecommunications Act of 1996 must be amended to clarify that \n        the substantial evidence test may be satisfied by testimony of \n        local residents expressing concerns about the impact of \n        personal wireless service facilities on aesthetics, property \n        values, and the character of residential neighborhoods. Such a \n        legislative change would not discriminate against personal \n        wireless service providers or impede their attempts to provide \n        personal wireless services, but instead would encourage \n        providers and States and localities to work together to design \n        towers, facilities, or other feasible alternatives that do not \n        intrude or diminish the aesthetics of residential communities, \n        thus avoiding costly and protracted litigation.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS.\n\n    (a) Substantial Evidence.--Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)(iii)) is amended by \nadding at the end the following: ``For purposes of this clause, the \nterm `substantial evidence' includes testimony by local residents \nexpressing their concerns about the impact of personal wireless service \nfacilities on the aesthetics, property values, and the character of the \ncommunity.''.\n    (b) Burden of Proof.--Section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) of such Act is \namended by inserting after the second sentence the following: ``In any \nsuch action in which a person seeking to place, construct, or modify a \ntower facility is a party, such person shall bear the burden of \nproof.''.",

oman , saudi arabia , and uae . \n the 10 included articles , 3 were prevalence studies , and the rest discussed potential risk factors or biomarkers for autism in patients from gcc countries . \n prevalence studies were conducted in uae,18 saudi arabia,19 oman,20 and bahrain.17 the prevalence of asd was 1.4 per 10,000 in oman , and 29 per 10,000 for pdd in uae , and 4.3 per 10,000 in bahrain.17,18,20 the saudi study documented patients characteristics and reasons for referral for group of saudi autistic patients.19 male gender and history of developmental delay were significantly associated with autism prevalence in all 3 studies . \n consanguinity was present in 28.6% of saudi patients , and behavioral problems such as hyperactivity or aggression were evident in 45% of patients ( table 1).19 summary of epidemiological studies on autism / autism spectrum disorder in the gulf cooperation countries . \n the included studies were conducted in saudi arabia , oman , or bahrain , and all employed the case - control study design . sample size varied between these studies from 52 to 204 patients ; and \n the risk factors investigated were : suboptimal breastfeeding,21 lead exposure,22 serum osteopontin,23 maternal and paternal age , cesarian section , and prenatal complications . \n delayed initiation of breastfeeding and no colostrum intake was associated with increased risk of asd . \n exclusive and prolonged breastfeeding ( up to 24 months or more ) markedly reduced the risk of developing asd.21 higher blood levels of lead22 and osteopontin23 were found in autism patients . \n occurrence of autistic disorder was correlated with maternal ( or 1.83 ) and paternal ( or 2.08 ) age above 30 years at time of birth . \n the disease was also more common among children of mothers who delivered with a cesarian section or had antenatal complications16,17 ( table 1 ) . \n lipid peroxidation,24 glutathione peroxidase,25 superoxide dismutase , sodium - potassium adenosine triphosphatase,21 lactate , saturated fatty acids,26 and homocysteine26 levels were significantly higher among autistic patients . \n inversely , levels of vitamin e,24 glutathione,24 folate , vitamin b12,27 and some polyunsaturated acids were much lower in autistic patients . \n serum osteopontin levels were higher among autistic patients,25 and levels were positively related to the severity of autism ( table 1 ) . \n prevalence studies were conducted in uae,18 saudi arabia,19 oman,20 and bahrain.17 the prevalence of asd was 1.4 per 10,000 in oman , and 29 per 10,000 for pdd in uae , and 4.3 per 10,000 in bahrain.17,18,20 the saudi study documented patients characteristics and reasons for referral for group of saudi autistic patients.19 male gender and history of developmental delay were significantly associated with autism prevalence in all 3 studies . \n consanguinity was present in 28.6% of saudi patients , and behavioral problems such as hyperactivity or aggression were evident in 45% of patients ( table 1).19 summary of epidemiological studies on autism / autism spectrum disorder in the gulf cooperation countries . \n the included studies were conducted in saudi arabia , oman , or bahrain , and all employed the case - control study design . sample size varied between these studies from 52 to 204 patients ;

there could be a lack of detection or lack of willingness to report certain behavior exhibited by a female child . \n this cultural perception could explain the older age for females at autism diagnosis in saudi arabia.19 either way ; more research is needed to explain other reasons behind this significant gender difference . \n still , with consanguinity rates in saudi arabia that range from 34 - 80% , depending on rural , or urban setting , this risk factor deserves further investigation.19,28 lead toxicity has been associated with autism,22 which is in agreement with other research.29 however , the nature of environmental exposure that might have contributed to lead toxicity was not clarified in the study . \n a strong dose - response protective effect of breastfeeding21 is in agreement with other studies,30,31 but potential for recall bias remains high as data collection depends on parents memory and reporting . \n findings for various biomarkers were comparable with studies carried out elsewhere.29,32 - 35 still , more research is needed to clarify applicability of these biomarkers for early screening or monitoring of autistic patients . \n first , is the sample size , as numbers of cases and controls used were small and can not be considered representative . also , the recruitment of cases and controls was from specialized clinics / tertiary care institutions , which might be problematic when extrapolating results to community autistic children in gcc countries . \n second , is that cases were recruited from pediatric wards , and none come from psychiatric clinics . \n the diagnosis of autism must include more comprehensive behavioral / psychological considerations to form a full picture about the disorder . \n the current study s limitations were the small number of studies identified and absence of studies from 3 gcc countries , which precluded comparing prevalence of autism across countries . \n generally , there is an evident lack of research into risk factors affecting the etiology of autism in gcc countries . \n consanguinity , multiparity , and closely - spaced pregnancies are common in the gcc region , and provide an exceptional opportunity to learn more about genetic determinants of the disease . \n also , dietary habits should be looked into as they could help in i ) investigating the risk and prognostic factors of the disease and , ii ) assisting families by identifying high - risk foods that could affect their children . \n more focus should be given to children in psychiatric wards to identify autistic symptoms among them . in conclusion , \n population - based studies should focus on quantifying the burden of asd in gcc countries . \n knowing the burden and extent of disease could help design screening tools that are applicable , culturally acceptable , and cost - effective to identify individuals who can benefit the most from early diagnosis and intervention . furthermore , raising asd awareness among parents , preschool / elementary school teachers are invaluable in helping autistic children cope with different challenges . \n generally , there is an evident lack of research into risk factors affecting the etiology of autism in gcc countries . \n consanguinity , multiparity , and closely - spaced pregnancies are common in the gcc region , and provide an exceptional opportunity to learn more about genetic determinants of the disease . \n also , dietary habits should be looked into as they could help in i ) investigating the risk and prognostic factors of the disease and , ii ) assisting families by identifying high - risk foods that could affect their children . \n more focus should be given to children in psychiatric wards to identify autistic symptoms among them . in conclusion \n , population - based studies should focus on quantifying the burden of asd in gcc countries . \n knowing the burden and extent of disease could help design screening tools that are applicable , culturally acceptable , and cost - effective to identify individuals who can benefit the most from early diagnosis and intervention . furthermore , raising asd awareness among parents , preschool / elementary school teachers are invaluable in helping autistic children cope with different challenges .",

      "document": "DESCRIPTION \n     This invention relates to a particle trap for a turbo-prop engine. \n     Static particle traps are built in a wide variety of ways, but they all operate making use of the inertia of particles transported by air entering the turbo-prop engine. These particles need to be diverted before they reach the compressors, since they could damage the compressor blades; a change is imposed on the direction of the stream in front of the entry to the trap, and particles continue along their original direction and enter the trap, coming out of the deviated flow. \n     The purpose of the invention is to place the trap in a favorable location so that it does not significantly increase the outside volume of the element of the turbo-prop engine in which it is fitted and does not apply any excessive constraints on the equipment layout in the engine. \n     More precisely, the particle trap proposed herein is fitted in the gas generator air intake, comprising a housing supporting a reduction gear driving a rotor supporting the propeller; this housing in which the particle trap is fitted supports suspension devices such as connecting rods, the housing and the propeller support rotor. \n     This particle trap included in the housing is located in an area that has to resist forces induced by the propeller, the gas generator and the weight of the assembly and to transmit these forces, which is unexpected from an element in the form of a chamber, and therefore essentially hollow and usually delimited by thin walls. On the contrary, known particle traps are normally located in &#34;dead&#34; areas of the engine, in other words they are not subject to large forces, and most of them are located in the stator housing around the flow stream. \n     The trap proposed here is delimited at the back by a circular end plate onto which connecting means between suspension devices and the surrounding structure are fitted, and this chamber is divided by suspension arms projecting forwards and towards the rotor center line from the end plate. These arms provide the strength of the trap and transmit suspension forces, and do not exist in currently used traps. Finally, it is easy to maintain this type of particle trap; all that is necessary is to drill the outside skin with doors immediately above the suspension arms and in a lower part from which all types of particles that have entered the trap can be emptied from it. \n     One favorable layout of the invention consists of making a perforation in the suspension arms in the lower part that they occupy in the chamber. \n    \n    \n     The invention will be described in more detail with respect to the following figures which are attached for illustrative purposes only. \n     FIG. 1 is an overall view of the front of a turbo-prop engine and the invention, \n     FIG. 2 is a general view of the invention, and \n     FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 illustrate part of the trap according to the invention as seen from behind, the side and the outside according to sections III--III, IV--IV and V--V in FIGS. 5, 3 and 4 respectively. \n    \n    \n     The entry cone to an aircraft turbopropeller is drawn more precisely in FIG. 1; this cone comprises a reduction gear housing 1 on which various equipment is fitted, and a rotor supporting the end of the propeller shaft 2 that drives the propeller 3 and the front cone 4. \n     The entry cone also comprises a skin 5 that prolongs the cone 4 at the back and on the inside forms the boundary to a primary annular flow stream 6 through which air accelerated by the blades of the propeller 3 enters the engine and passes through the compressors and the turbines (not shown). The primary stream 6 is surrounded by a leading edge 7 that directs the air flow. \n     The housing 1 is suspended from the aircraft structure 9 by three rods 10. \n     The three suspension arms 11 (also seen in FIGS. 2 and 4) are screwed onto end plate 12 facing devises 13 and rods 10, and extend forwards and towards the inside of the engine, in other words towards the axis of rotation of shaft 2, as far as the reduction housing 1 to which they are screwed by flanges 14. \n     The particle trap 15 is in the shape of an annular chamber; it is delimited at the back by end plate 12, at the front by an entry 16 extending the primary stream 6, on the inside by separation leading edge 17 that separates it from a convergent portion of the primary stream 8 leading to the compressors and at the outside by a skin 18. The particle trap 15 operates like other particle traps, in other words it receives particles of all types accidentally drawn in by the engine and projected into it by inertia thus leaving the air flow, which continues along the primary stream 6. However, it can be seen that part of the suspension arms 11 divides this flow; as can be seen even better in FIG. 2, there is a suspension arm 11 at the top and two others extend towards the side, above the horizontal, such that the annular chamber in trap 15 is divided into two lateral angular sectors and one lower angular sector. The housing of the reduction gear 1 is suspended from the structure 9 by prolonging the rods 10 and the suspension arms 11. \n     The presence of the suspension arms 11 does not hinder the entry of particles, but maintenance of the engine makes it necessary to empty the trap 15. This is why the outside partition 18 for doors 19 is drilled, one on each sector of the chamber; two of these doors open towards side sectors and extend immediately above the side suspension arms 11 and the third door 19 opening at the bottom of the external partition 18 provides access to the lower sector; the contents of the trap 15 drop outside as soon as the doors 19 are opened. \n     But since it may be useful to encourage at least partial accumulation of particles at the bottom of trap in area 20, despite the suspension arms 11, they do not completely divide the annular chamber of the trap 15, but they are provided with a drilling at the bottom of the region in which they extend into trap 15 to allow at least the finest collected particles to drop into the lower sector of the chamber. One of these drillings is marked as reference 21 in FIGS. 1 and 4. \n     As in the described embodiment, if there is an arm 11 as far as the top of the trap 15, it would be advantageous if it is drilled in the same way as the others so that particles cannot accumulate on it, in order to prevent the need to handle two different models.",
      "summary": "The particle trap (15) that extends behind an elbow in the air flow stream (6) in a turbo-prop engine is delimited at the back by an end plate (12) to which intake housing suspension rods (10) supporting the front of the rotating shaft (2), are fastened. It is divided by suspension arms (11) which may be drilled (21) to restore the continuity of the annular chamber forming the trap. Therefore the intake housing suspension device extends through the trap. This type of trap makes use of the inertia of solid bodies carried by the air drawn in, and which could damage the engine blades, and to collect them.",

      "summary": "Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015 This bill requires the Department of Treasury to implement and maintain a voluntary prospective reporting system for employers subject to the employer mandate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).  Employers satisfy the information return requirement if they voluntarily report general information about the health coverage offered to full-time employees. Employers satisfy the employee statement requirement if they provide statements to employees after receiving exchange notification that employee or spouse or dependent enrolled in a qualified health plan or qualified for premium tax credits or cost-sharing subsidies. The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) permit employers and health insurance issuers that provide minimum essential coverage to submit an information return with names and birth dates of covered dependents if the employer or health insurance issuer does not already collect or maintain their taxpayer identification numbers, and (2) permit electronic delivery of employee statement if employee consented previously to electronic delivery of other notices and does not refuse consent in writing.  It directs the Government Accountability Office to: (1) evaluate the exchange notification and appeals processes for employers whose employee or spouse or dependent enrolls in a qualified health plan or qualifies for premium tax credits or cost-sharing subsidies, and (2) evaluate the prospective reporting system functionality.  The legislation permits a health insurance exchange to automatically reenroll an individual into a qualified health plan after annually redetermining the individual's eligibility for premium tax credits or cost-sharing subsidies.

      "document": "most clinical complications associated with hepatitis b are manifested in conditions , particularly cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) as consequences of chronic infection . \n hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is the sixth most common in the world and the third leading cause of cancer - related death ( 1 ) . \n an effective vaccine has been available for more than two decades , which has decreased the prevalence of hbv infection worldwide dramatically . \n the primary goal of hepatitis b prevention is reduction of chronic hbv infection and hbv - related chronic liver disease . \n a secondary goal is prevention of acute hepatitis b. in 1991 , the world health organization recommended that all countries include hepatitis vaccine in their routine infant immunization program , especially in areas where hepatitis b is endemic ( 2 ) . \n the global reported decline in hbsag prevalence , especially from hbv endemic area ( such as south east asia , alaska , etc . ) has been come as something of a surprise . \n naively speaking , one would expect that the ultimate decline is reaching ; however , this is not the case ; universally , about 5 - 20% of vaccine failure among recipients has been reported manifested by different levels of hypo- or nonresponsiveness to hbv vaccination ( 4 , 5 ) . \n historically , the potency of immune response after immunization against hepatitis b has been assessed by measuring antibody to hbsag . \n the persistence of anti - hbs above the protection level ( > 10 iu / ml ) in vaccine recipient is the main goal . \n this persistence declines by age , particularly , during the first years after vaccination ( 6 ) . on the other hand , \n a growing body of literature has shown that hbv vaccine - induced immunologic memory lasting persists more than 15 years after immunization ( 7 , 8) . in 1989 , iranian ministry of health launched an immunization program in four provinces as a pilot plan . \n afterwards , many researches conducted on the level of response to hbv vaccine among iranian children and ample data on the coverage rate of vaccine together with evaluation of vaccine responsiveness published in iran so far . in this study , a systematic review and meta - analysis was performed to provide the statistic power on investigations performed nationally and to provide a summary of the results . \n we performed a comprehensive search on pubmed , isi , scopus , iran medex and scientific information database ( sid ) , on published describing anti - hbs levels in children below 15 years ( after six months to 15 years old ) who received three doses of hbv vaccine following epi . \n the primary outcome was frequency of persons with protective levels of anti - hbs ( > 10 iu / ml ) following hbv vaccination . \n the secondary outcome was frequency of nonresponders to hbv vaccine ( < 10 iu / ml ) . \n the main inclusion criterion was all studies that included subjects under 15 years old who received 3 doses of hbv vaccine ( regardless of type and brand of vaccines ) . \n we excluded all studies in which individuals received vaccine episodes out of vaccination schedule ( less or more administrations ) and in those with any medical interventions ( such as using adjuvant , booster doses etc . ) . \n moreover , we did not include surveys that investigated responsiveness to vaccine in those with medical conditions ( children born to hbsag positive mothers , thalassemia , dialysis , received hb vaccine plus immunoglobulin , predisposing factors for immunodeficiency such as hiv , etc . ) . \n data was extracted from selected studies including the name of author , year of publication , the mean age of participants and the levels of anti - hbs in different case - studied . \n subjects were divided into two categories : responders who showed anti - hbs levels > 10 iu / ml and nonresponders ( anti - hbs < 10 iu / ml ) . \n we merged the subjects who harbored levels between two extremes ;

500.95  484.19 and 164.82  139.44 iu / ml for those who were under 3 years old versus children more than 3 years old . \n meta - regression analysis showed that with increase in age , the number of responders to vaccine decreased significantly ( p = 0.001 ) ( table 2 ) . \n put another way , the number of nonresponders to vaccine increased as age of vaccines increased ( p < 0.001 ) . \n the other finding was that between years 1995 and 2014 , there was no significant difference in the mean anti - hbs titers between studies ( p = 0.428 ) . \n however , results from 24 publications indicated that of total 10562 children , 5070 ( 56.3% ) of males and 3937 ( 43.7% ) of females had antibody levels of > 10 iu / ml . \n in contrast , 1346 ( 59.0% ) and 938 ( 41.0% ) of males and females had antibody levels of < 10 iu / ml , respectively . \n final result for meta - analysis and model performed for total estimated prevalence is shown in table 3 . however , there was no strong difference between responders versus nonresponders to vaccine ( p = 0.119 ) . \n forest plot of prevalence of hbv vaccine responsiveness in iranian general , male and female population is shown in figures 1 - 3 , respectively . despite some studies \n did not specify the type of vaccine used , using different vaccines ( heberbiovac , cuba ; engerix - b , gsk ; recombivax , cuba ; euvax b ) with the same protocol for vaccine doses and administrations , did not show any significant differences regarding response rate to vaccine ( p < 0.001 ) . \n furthermore , prevalence of anti - hbc was between 0 and 7.5% in different reports ( table 1 ) . in those studies which compared the rate of responsiveness to hbv vaccine between urban and rural area \n , no significant differences were found between responders and nonresponders ( results not shown ) . \n no significant complications and side effects were reported after vaccine administration ( results not shown ) . \n response to vaccine according to ethnic groups ( turkish , arab , kurdish , turkmen , etc . ) and geographic area was evaluated ; however , no strong correlations were found ( p 0.826 and 0.896 , respectively ) . \n data are presented as % for  10   t : total ; m : male ; f : female   abbreviations : ni : non identified . \n hbv expanded program on immunization was started in iran in 1993 . accordingly , more than 98% of infants \n there are ample data on the vaccine coverage rate , response to the vaccine , amnestic response to booster doses etc . among iranian healthy children . \n moreover , most of those articles published in persian language , makes the interpretation of data more incomprehensible . in this review , the impacts of different variables including age , gender , type of vaccine etc . on the rate of responsiveness \n of 11639 children - studied , 9311 ( 80% ) and 2328 ( 20% ) were responders and nonresponders to vaccine , respectively . \n there have been numerous published data on the rate of response to hbv vaccine internationally ; the reported rate of hbv vaccine responsiveness ranged between 41.6 and 98.3% ( table 4 ) . \n the reverse was also realistic for the extreme of no responsiveness to vaccine . in iran , \n the rate of responders to vaccine was between 47.6 and 98.3% ; however , in most studies ( 24 out of 28 papers , 85.7% ) , responders were above 69% of population in the surveys . \n regarding the impact of age on the rate of response to vaccine , we did not find a significant difference between subjects , despite finding cut - off levels for anti - hbs between 500.95 and 164.82 iu / ml for those who were under three years old versus children more than three years old , respectively . \n there are considerable variations between studies for association between the age of participants and response to vaccine . the massive gaps between the extreme of these results substantially correlated to the age of vaccines . \n for example , table 4 shows that more increase in the age of vaccines , the more decline in the rate of responders . \n the other important issue is the timing between the last dose of vaccine administration and measurement of anti - hbs . \n globally , in various reports , the age of children ranged between 5 and 15 years old ; which makes substantial variance between the levels of anti - hbs in different age groups . on the other hand , this review and other studies showed that with increase in age , the number of nonresponders to vaccine increased significantly . \n versatile ethnic groups , geographic variations , different age groups between subjects and difference in the endemicity of hbv in those areas might be the reasons for such discrepancies . \n what is the impact of low level of anti - hbs on acquisition of hbv infection ? \n taken together , with exception of some rare reports on healthcare workers who were nonresponders to vaccine and subsequently infected with hbv ( 47 - 49 ) , there is no data to support that after robust rising in anti - hbs following hbv vaccination , subsequent decrease in anti - hbs levels endanger the subject to hbv infection ( 50 ) . \n previous results showed that memory t cells maintain the response to the virus after encountering . \n this issue has been highlighted by the fact that after booster dose(s ) of hbv vaccine in hypo / nonresponders , there has been amnestic response manifested by increase in the levels of anti - hbs ( 45 , 51 ) . \n interestingly , between years 1995 and 2014 , there was no significant difference in the mean anti - hbs titers between iranian studies ( p = 0.428 ) . this finding together with this issue that the type of vaccine used did not show any significant differences between the rate of response to vaccine ( p > 0.05 ) , indicate the reasonable potency and antigenicity of vaccine used in iranian epi , which were already assessed by our lab in vivo and in vitro studies ( 52 , 53 ) . despite some studies showed some differences in response to hbv vaccine between rural and urban areas ( 54 - 57 ) \n furthermore , in our own yet unpublished study on 1200 samples from two categories of rural and urban districts , we did not find any considerable changes ( jazayeri s unpublished manuscript ) . \n overall , iranian surveys did not find any significant correlation between gender of participants and the rate of response to vaccine ( p = 0.119 ) , which was similar to other findings ( table 4 ) . \n iran is considered as an intermediate area for hbsag prevalence ( 2.54% ) ( 58 ) . \n on the other hand , the rate of past hbv infection , manifested by anti - hbc , ranged between 0 and 7.7% in this review . both relative high prevalence for hbsag ( 4.6% ) and anti - hbc ( 7.7% ) \n previous reports showed rates of 6.3% hbsag and 8% anti - hbc in general population in these areas , respectively ( 59 , 60 ) . \n however , our unpublished data on 821 samples from vaccinated children showed no positive cases for both two markers ( jazayeri and alavian , unpublished ) . \n altogether , 0 to 1.29% prevalence of hbsag together with 0 to 2.5% anti - hbc from different provinces underscored the usefulness of hbv vaccination for substantial reduction in hbv endemicity in iran . \n second , the vaccine was effective in stimulating the immune response of vaccines reasonably , despite being different in generation , manufacturers and types . \n third , there was no substantial difference between iranian and other international investigations in the rate of nonresponsiveness to hbv vaccine .",

If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

      "document": "Whether many provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) apply to a particular drug product turns in part on the novelty of the \"active ingredient\" of the drug in question. In particular, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must assess the novelty of the active ingredient in a new drug, comparing it to a previously approved drug's active ingredient to determine whether the new drug qualifies for the five-year \"new chemical entity\" (NCE) exclusivity. FDA generally cannot accept new drug applications or abbreviated new drug applications that refer to a drug with NCE exclusivity (i.e., rely on its clinical data and FDA's approval of the drug) for five years. Companies that receive approval for drugs with new active ingredients generally enjoy a competitive advantage in the market while the exclusivity is in effect until generic drugs enter the market. Given how expensive it can be to bring a new drug to market, when Congress passed the Hatch-Waxman Amendments in 1984 to allow an abbreviated pathway for approval of generic drugs, it also created NCE exclusivity to reward innovators of new pharmaceutical products with an opportunity to recoup their investment. To determine whether FD&C Act provisions that depend in part on the drug's \"active ingredient\" apply, FDA must evaluate the \"active ingredient(s)\" of both the drug under review and any previously approved drug that may contain the same active ingredient. This process can be technically quite complicated. For instance, compounds in a final drug product may convert to other compounds through chemical reactions inside the body before arriving at the site of the therapeutic effect, and related but distinct drug molecules may be clinically indistinguishable or convert into the same pharmacologically or physiologically active component inside the body. This phenomenon raises the question of which molecule\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one existing before or after ingestion\u00e2\u0080\u0094should be the relevant molecule for purposes of determining active ingredient. Alternatively, two drug molecules with the same core compound may have different compounds appended to them by either covalent (i.e., shared electrons) or noncovalent (i.e., no shared electrons) bonds. For example, replacing a hydrogen atom in an acid molecule with \"a metal or its equivalent\" forms a salt, whereas replacing the hydrogen atom with \"an organic radical\" forms an ester. These derivatives may or may not vary from each other in clinically significant ways, raising the question of which derivative(s), if any, should be considered as the same active ingredient as the core or base molecule. Generally, a more expansive interpretation of the phrase \"active ingredient,\" that is, one that considers more types of derivatives to be the same active ingredient, reduces the number of drugs eligible for NCE regulatory exclusivity by expanding the drug ingredients considered previously approved, which, in turn, allows for earlier introduction of generic versions of those drugs. As discussed in more detail below, historically, for purposes of the exclusivity provisions, FDA has interpreted \"active ingredient,\" as the term appears in statute, to mean \"active moiety,\" as defined by FDA regulations. FDA generally defines active moiety as the core molecule or ion of a drug (i.e., the drug molecule without certain appendages) that is \"responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of a drug substance.\" FDA's interpretation has generated disputes between FDA and pharmaceutical companies, as FDA's approach tends to exclude some drugs from being afforded five-year NCE exclusivity under the FD&C Act. In 2015, a federal district court rejected FDA's interpretation as inconsistent with the statutory language, though it did not explicitly invalidate FDA's regulations. This report discusses FDA's interpretation of the FD&C Act as referring to active moieties, judicial review of FDA's interpretation, and how FDA's rationale has changed over time. In the 116th Congress, legislation has been introduced that would generally codify FDA's current approach to evaluating NCE exclusivity and extend that approach to other provisions under the FD&C Act that include the phrase \"active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient).\" Multiple provisions of the FD&C Act use the phrase \"active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient).\" Among them are a provision for five-year exclusivity to drugs approved under a new drug application (NDA) with active ingredients that FDA has not previously approved, a provision for three-year exclusivity for drugs with the same active ingredient as previously approved drugs that required additional clinical studies for approval due to other changes, and provisions authorizing priority review vouchers for certain types of drugs. In the context of the five-year-exclusivity, which FDA has coined \"new chemical entity\" or NCE exclusivity, FDA interprets the term \"active ingredient\" to mean \"active moiety.\" FDA reasons that this definition, which allows a wider range of molecules to be considered previously approved, is warranted in the new drug context to encourage innovation by ensuring that a new drug is truly innovative. This interpretation of \"active ingredient\" in the NCE exclusivity context has been the subject of a decades-long debate. The statutory provision on NCE exclusivity states, in relevant part, If an application submitted under subsection (b) of this section for a drug, no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) of which has been approved in any other application under subsection (b) of this section, is approved . . . no application may be submitted under this subsection which refers to the drug for which the subsection (b) application was submitted before the expiration of five years from the date of approval of the application under subsection (b) of this section . . . . Disputes over how FDA should interpret this provision have centered on the meaning of the phrase \"active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient).\" The FD&C Act does not define the term \"active ingredient.\" Rather than define \"active ingredient\" for purposes of the exclusivity provisions, FDA examines the relevant drugs' active moieties. Specifically, FDA defines NCE exclusivity in its regulations as \"a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other application submitted under section 505(b) of the act.\" The various other exclusivity regulations also refer to active moieties. FDA defines \"active moiety\" in its regulations as follows: Active moiety is the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. As one court put it, \"[f]or salts, esters, and noncovalent derivatives, a molecule's 'active moiety' can be thought of as its core; salt, ester and noncovalent derivative versions of the same basic molecule have different appendages, but they share the same active moiety.\" Put another way, because these specified derivatives would be considered to have the same \"active moiety,\" if FDA approves a drug containing any one of the specified derivatives as the active ingredient, a later approved drug containing another form of a specified derivative or even the core molecule would not be entitled to NCE exclusivity. For instance, if Drug A contains as its active ingredient a salt , ester , or other noncovalent derivative of a molecule that FDA previously approved as part of Drug B, Drug A would not be entitled to NCE exclusivity because FDA had previously approved that active moiety. Similarly, if Drug B contains as its active ingredient a salt derivative of a molecule, and Drug A contains that same molecule or an ester derivative of that molecule and is approved after Drug B, Drug A would not be entitled to NCE exclusivity. In contrast, if Drug A contained as its active ingredient a non-ester covalent derivative of a molecule that FDA previously approved in Drug B, Drug A could be considered to have a new active moiety and be eligible for NCE exclusivity if other relevant conditions are met. If a drug molecule is converted to a different but related compound after ingestion, the relevant molecule for determining active moiety is the compound in the final drug product before the drug is ingested. In the NCE exclusivity context, FDA's interpretation of \"active ingredient\" as \"active moiety,\" as well as its definition of \"active moiety,\" have both been subject to dispute. Challenges to FDA's approach to NCE exclusivity have generally addressed two questions: 1. Whether FDA may permissibly interpret the phrase \"no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) of which has been approved\" as \"a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved.\" 2. Whether FDA has correctly defined \"active moiety,\" including whether FDA may permissibly deny exclusivity for\u00e2\u0080\u0094in addition to \"salts and esters,\" which appear in the statute\u00e2\u0080\u0094other noncovalent derivatives of the underlying drug molecule. Proposed Rule. In 1989, in its implementing regulations for the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, FDA first interpreted the FD&C Act's exclusivity provisions to distinguish between NCEs, which are entitled to a five-year term of regulatory exclusivity, and previously approved active ingredients, which are entitled to three years of regulatory exclusivity, based on active moieties. To support its interpretation in the proposed rule, the agency relied on the statutory text, FDA's preexisting classification scheme for drugs that included a \"new molecular entity\" class based on active moieties, and the legislative history of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. FDA reasoned that \"Congress was aware of FDA's classification scheme\" when it passed the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, including FDA's \"longstanding interpretation of the term 'new molecular entity' [as] a compound containing an entirely new active moiety.\" In support of its definition of active moiety, which includes other noncovalent derivatives of a drug molecule in addition to the drug molecule itself and its salt and esters, FDA reasoned that Congress \"did not intend to confer significant periods of exclusivity on minor variations of previously approved chemical compounds.\" FDA did not specifically identify which part of the statutory phrase \"an active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient)\" it had determined to be ambiguous when adopting the interpretation of \"active moiety.\" Initial Litigation Rejecting FDA Approach . Between FDA's proposed rule in 1989 and its final rule in 1994 implementing the exclusivity regulations, two cases addressed the agency's interpretation of the phrase \"active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient)\" to mean active moiety. In Abbott Laboratories v. Young , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit) considered FDA's denial of 10-year exclusivity for Depakote, an anticonvulsant seizure medication that used divalproex sodium as its active ingredient. FDA based its decision on findings that (1)\u00c2\u00a0divalproex sodium is a salt of valproic acid that converts into valproic acid in the body, and (2)\u00c2\u00a0the agency previously approved valproic acid as the active ingredient in Depakene. The court determined that the FD&C Act's use of the phrase \" the active ingredient\" is ambiguous, as it could refer to the active ingredient in the original approved drug or in the later approved drug. However, the D.C. Circuit rejected FDA's reliance on the term \"including\" to justify using its definition of active moiety, which extends beyond salts and esters of the active ingredient to other noncovalent derivative molecules, as \" linguistically infeasible.\" Specially, the court concluded that Congress used the term \"including\" in the provision at issue not to provide examples of molecular derivatives undeserving of regulatory exclusivity but to extend the covered active ingredients to the two particular derivatives\u00e2\u0080\u0094esters and salts. Upon concluding that the statute is ambiguous and that FDA failed to provide a reasonable construction, the D.C. Circuit remanded the case to FDA for further actions. Around the same time, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) considered the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (USPTO's) denial of Glaxo's request for a patent-term extension for its patent claiming cefuroxime axetil, the active ingredient in Ceftin tablets. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments require the USPTO to extend the terms of a patent claiming a product or a method of using or manufacturing a product when (1) the product is \"subject to a regulatory review period\" (e.g., the FDA drug approval process) and (2) the permission to market the product following the regulatory review (e.g., FDA approval of the drug) is the \"first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product .\" In turn, the statute defines \"product\" to mean \"the active ingredient of a new drug . . . including any ester or salt of the active ingredient.\" Interpreting the product as the active moiety, the USPTO found that cefuroxime (an acid) rather than cefuroxime axetil (an ester of cefuroxime) was the active moiety in Ceftin. Because FDA had previously approved two drugs with cefuroxime salts as active ingredients, the USPTO determined that FDA's approval of Ceftin was not the \"first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product\" and denied the patent-term extension. The Federal Circuit held that the USPTO's denial of the patent term extension was contrary to law, affirming the district court's judgment. In contrast to the D.C. Circuit, which viewed the relevant statutory language as ambiguous, the Federal Circuit held that the terms in the phrase \"active ingredient of a new drug . . . including any ester or salt of the active ingredient\" all have a plain meaning. The court determined\u00e2\u0080\u0094without discussing its reasoning in any detail\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the USPTO's interpretation was inconsistent with the plain meaning of these terms. While acknowledging that legislative history can reveal \"a clearly expressed legislative intention contrary to the statutory language,\" it identified no such support for the USPTO's interpretation here. Because the court found there was no clear legislative intent that the phrase be interpreted to refer to variations on the approved active ingredients beyond that product's ester or salt, an extension of the term for the patent claiming cefuroxime axetil was warranted because FDA had not approved that drug product or an ester or salt of it. While the appellate court did not elaborate on how it arrived at its interpretation, the district court had included more detail on the plain meaning of the operative statutory phrase, concluding that cefuroxime\u00e2\u0080\u0094the acid from which cefuroxime axetil is derived\u00e2\u0080\u0094could not be an \"active ingredient\" of Ceftin because it was not an ingredient , as that term is commonly understood because it did not appear in the Ceftin tablets in that form. Final Rule. In the wake of these rulings, public comments to FDA's proposed rule contended that Abbott Laboratories and Glaxo Operations rejected the agency's proposed interpretation of the NCE exclusivity provision, particularly its reliance on the phrase active moieties. Nonetheless, when FDA finalized its NCE exclusivity regulations in 1994, the agency included its proposed definition of \"active moiety,\" but modified its justification. Rather than interpreting the parenthetical phrase (i.e., \"(including any ester or salt of the active ingredient)\") \"broadly to include all active ingredients that are different but contain the same active moiety,\" which the D.C. Circuit in Abbott Laboratories had rejected as \"linguistically impermissible,\" the agency concluded that the term \" active ingredient,\" as used in the relevant provision, means active moiety. FDA did not, however, directly address the Federal Circuit's opinion. FDA also disagreed with comments objecting to its inclusion of other noncovalent derivatives in the definition of \"active moiety,\" meaning that such derivatives would not receive NCE exclusivity. The agency reaffirmed that it \"does not believe that providing exclusivity for . . . noncovalent derivatives of a previously approved active moiety would be consistent with the statutory intent\" because such derivatives \"generally do[] not affect the active moiety of a drug product.\" FDA accordingly enacted the definition of active moiety as proposed. D.C. Circuit Upholds FDA Use of Pre-Ingestion Rather than Post-Ingestion to Interpret Active Ingredient . In 2010, in Actavis Elizabeth LLC v. FDA , the D.C. Circuit revisited FDA's interpretation of \"active ingredient,\" nearly two decades after the agency finalized its regulations in 1994. That opinion focused specifically on the term \"active ingredient\" in the context of whether the relevant molecule should be considered prior to its ingestion in the human body (i.e., the compound in the final drug product pre-ingestion) or after ingestion where the compound may convert to another related compound (e.g., from an ester to an acid) that is responsible for the drug's therapeutic effects (i.e., post-ingestion). A generic manufacturer challenged FDA's award of NCE exclusivity for Vyvanse, a drug that treats attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Vyvanse's active ingredient is lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a salt of lisdexamfetamine, meaning that lisdexamfetamine is the active moiety under FDA regulations. Lisdexamfetamine uses an amide bond (a type of covalent bond involving nitrogen) to connect a portion of lysine, a common amino acid, with dextroamphetamine. Once in the body, a chemical reaction converts lisdexamfetamine to dextroamphetamine. FDA had approved drugs with dextroamphetamine but had not yet approved drugs with lisdexamfetamine. Actavis, a generic manufacturer seeking to market a generic version of Vyvanse, alleged that because dextroamphetamine is responsible for the therapeutic effect inside the body and FDA had previously approved drugs with dextroamphetamine, Vyvanse had no right to NCE exclusivity. Focusing on the term \"active,\" Actavis contended that \"active ingredient\" necessarily must refer to \"the drug molecule that reaches the 'site' of the drug's action\" because that is the part of the drug responsible for its \"activity,\" which Activis argued meant the therapeutic effect. The court rejected Actavis's arguments. First, the court observed that the FD&C Act does not define the term \"active ingredient\" and that the statute's legislative history \"is silent on what determines novelty\" for NCE exclusivity. The court also concluded that the statute's structure and purpose did not preclude FDA's interpretation. Accordingly, the court held that (1) \"active ingredient\" is ambiguous as to whether it referred to the pre-ingestion or post-ingestion molecule, and (2) FDA's interpretation of \"active ingredient\" to refer to the pre-ingestion molecule is reasonable. The court further affirmed FDA's choice of a bright-line distinction between noncovalent derivatives (which do not receive NCE exclusivity) and non-ester covalent derivatives (which can receive NCE exclusivity and was at issue for Vyvance). While the D.C. Circuit acknowledged that some noncovalent bonds might alter a drug's properties and some covalent bonds might not, the court deferred to FDA's explanation that \"its policy is based in part on the 'difficulty in determining precisely which molecule, or portion of a molecule, is responsible for a drug's effects.'\" The court did not, however, directly address FDA's use of the term \"active moiety,\" its inclusion of the other noncovalent derivatives in the definition, or the interaction between FDA's definition of active moiety and the statutory parenthetical. District Court Rejects FDA Interpretation of Active Ingredient as Active Moiety. Five years later, in Amarin Pharmaceuticals Ireland Ltd. v. FDA , a federal district court in the District of Columbia expressly considered FDA's interpretation of \"active ingredient\" to mean \"active moiety,\" as defined in its regulations. Amarin had obtained FDA approval for Vascepa , whose active ingredient is icosapent ethyl, the ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a type of omega-3 fatty acid. But FDA denied Amarin's request for NCE exclusivity for Vascepa because it had previously approved Lovaza, a drug whose active ingredient is \"a mixture that is primarily composed of seven kinds of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters\" including the ester of EPA. When FDA approved Lovaza, it considered the mixture as a whole the \"active ingredient,\" and it later denied a petition from Lovaza's sponsor requesting FDA to recharacterize Lovaza as having multiple active ingredients on the grounds that \"the Lovaza mixture has not been 'fully characterized.'\" In other words, in approving Lovaza, FDA did not specifically approve an ester of EPA (or any other component omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters) as an active ingredient. But when evaluating Vascepa's eligibility for NCE exclusivity, FDA relied on new studies to find that EPA was an active moiety of Lovaza and that, accordingly, FDA had previously approved Vascepa's active moiety. Rather than recognize multiple active ingredients in Vascepa, FDA provided a new interpretation framework for certain mixtures to treat them as having one active ingredient but multiple active moieties . In its decision letter to Amarin, FDA acknowledged that the agency had previously taken an inconsistent approach to identifying the active ingredients and active moieties for naturally derived mixtures, such as Lovaza, when evaluating NCE exclusivity. FDA \"explained that, although they are often conflated, it is important to distinguish between the meaning of the terms active ingredient and active moiety.\" And that while \"the distinction between active moiety and active ingredient[] generally is negligible\" for \"drugs that are composed of a single, well-characterized molecule,\" \"the distinction between active ingredient and active moiety . . . becomes crucial\" \"[f]or naturally derived mixtures comprising multiple molecules.\" Critically, the agency distinguished between (1) \"poorly characterized\" and (2) \"well-characterized mixtures\" based on how difficult it is \"'to determine with any certainty . . . which molecules in the mixture are consistently present or potentially are responsible for the physiological or pharmacological activity of the drug.'\" For poorly characterized mixtures, FDA stated that it had \"of necessity\" treated the whole mixture as both the active ingredient and the active moiety. However, for well-characterized mixtures, FDA outlined \"a three-part 'framework' 'for identifying the active moiety or moieties of such mixtures.'\" FDA would consider component parts of well-characterized mixtures to be previously approved active moieties if 1. specific molecules in the mixture have been identified; 2. those specific molecules are \"consistently present in the mixture\"; and 3. those molecules are \"responsible at least in part for the physiological or pharmacological action of the mixture, based on a finding that they make a meaningful contribution to the activity of the mixture.\" In effect, for single-molecule and poorly characterized drugs, FDA would apply a one-to-one approach between the active ingredient and active moiety, but for well-characterized mixtures, it would apply a one-to-many approach: one active ingredient with multiple active moieties. The district court set aside FDA's decision denying NCE exclusivity for Vascepa based on its interpretation of \"active ingredient\" to mean \"active moiety\". The court first relied on the canon against surplusage, finding that FDA's interpretation of the term \"active ingredient\" \"would render the parenthetical clause in the exclusivity provisions either redundant or incomprehensible.\" By defining active moiety to exclude \"those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt . . . or other noncovalent derivative,\" the court concluded that FDA rendered the statutory parenthetical \"(including any ester or salt of the active ingredient)\" either unnecessary or incomprehensible. The court reasoned that FDA in effect read the parenthetical out of the statute by inserting \"active moiety\" in place of \"active ingredient,\" violating the canon against surplusage that assumes Congress does not include unnecessary language in a statute. The court then used the presumption of consistent usage to reject FDA's view of active ingredient as synonymous with active moiety. Significantly, FDA only interpreted active ingredient to mean active moiety with respect to the FD&C Act's exclusivity provisions , relying on alternative interpretations of \"active ingredient\" elsewhere in the statute, such as, perhaps most notably, the provision allowing sponsors to submit abbreviated NDAs for generic drugs with the same active ingredient as an approved drug. FDA argued that it was justified in adopting different interpretations of the same phrase in different parts of the statute because the provisions had different statutory purposes. The agency contended that because the abbreviated NDA process focuses on safety and efficacy, a narrower range of molecules should be considered identical to previously approved drugs to ensure that FDA conducts a full review for safety and efficacy of any drugs that may clinically differ from previously approved drugs. In contrast, FDA argued that the exclusivity provisions aim to encourage innovation, requiring a wider range of molecules to be considered previously approved to ensure the new drug is truly innovative. While acknowledging that \"the presumption of consistent usage is not unrebuttable,\" the court considered FDA's justifications for the differing interpretations of active ingredient unpersuasive. The court observed that Congress passed both provisions at the same time in the same part of the same statute, that the abbreviated NDA provisions and exclusivity provisions were two sides of the same coin intended to balance competition and innovation, and that Congress included the parenthetical \"including any ester or salt of the active ingredient\" in the exclusivity provision but not the abbreviated NDA provision, thus already distinguishing between the two provisions. Finally, the court determined that FDA's use of active moiety was inconsistent with the statutory requirement that the active ingredient \"has been approved.\" It noted that FDA approves active ingredients, not active moieties, and that under FDA's proposed framework it would not even determine the relevant active moiety under another drug applied for exclusivity. Accordingly, an active moiety would never have previously been approved. Rejecting each of FDA's arguments and concluding FDA's interpretation invalid on multiple grounds, the court set aside the specific administrative decision being challenged in that case\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, FDA's exclusivity determination for Vascepa\u00e2\u0080\u0094and remanded to FDA. The court did not, however, explicitly invalidate or set aside FDA's implementing regulations. FDA regulations therefore remain in place, but with questions looming as to their validity and defensibility. Beyond whether FDA can interpret the phrase \"active ingredient\" in the FD&C Act's exclusivity provisions to mean active moiety, how FDA has defined \"active moiety\" has also been the subject of legal challenges. The statutory parenthetical includes esters and salts of an active ingredient as the same active ingredient for determining exclusivity, meaning that an ester and salt of an active ingredient is ineligible for exclusivity. FDA's definition of active moiety extends beyond those two derivatives, however, to also include molecules with other noncovalent appendages . At the same time, the agency excludes from its definition of active moiety molecules with appendages attached through non-ester covalent bonds, meaning that drug molecules that differ from previously approved drugs based on such appendages would be eligible for NCE exclusivity. Brand name manufacturers have challenged including other noncovalent derivatives, which limits the availability of NCE exclusivity, while generic manufacturers have challenged excluding non-ester covalent derivatives, which expands the availability of NCE exclusivity. Other Derivatives with Noncovalent Bonds. As discussed above, Abbott Laboratories v. Young also addressed FDA's inclusion of other noncovalent derivative forms of the molecule in addition to salts and esters, which the statute explicitly includes. At the time, FDA relied on a broad interpretation of the word \"including\" to justify examining the base molecule without salts, esters, or any other component connected by noncovalent bonds. The agency viewed the term \"including\" as providing examples of molecules that would be considered minor modifications that do not merit five-year NCE exclusivity, rather than an exhaustive list. While the Abbott Laboratories court considered FDA's approach defensible on policy grounds, it considered the agency's approach \"linguistically infeasible.\" It stated that it \"cannot agree with [FDA's] unconvincing attempts to employ the 'including' clause to cover all possible permutations of active ingredient,\" distinguishing the NCE exclusivity \"including\" clause \"from instances where an 'including' clause is designed to merely illustrate a few examples of the general category.\" Rather than provide its own interpretation, however, the court remanded the decision to FDA. FDA subsequently modified its interpretation of the statutory language in its 1994 final regulations. Rather than interpret the parenthetical phrase, the agency concluded that the term \"active ingredient\" means \"active moiety,\" as defined in its regulations. In so doing, FDA reaffirmed its view that allowing NCE exclusivity for other noncovalent derivatives would be inconsistent with statutory intent. In 2015, as explained above, Amarin Pharmaceuticals Ireland Ltd. v. FDA rejected FDA's revised interpretation. However, because the court only set aside the challenged agency action at issue in that case without invalidating FDA regulations, FDA regulations remain in force with its original definition of \"active moiety.\" Derivatives with Non-Ester Covalent Bonds. As discussed above, in Actavis Elizabeth LLC v. FDA , the D.C. Circuit upheld FDA's decision to exclude derivatives with different covalent bonds from its definition of active moiety. Unlike noncovalent bonds, covalent bonds entail the sharing of electrons between molecules, which tends to create a stronger bond. The court held that FDA's policy was reasonably \"based on its view that drug derivatives containing non-ester covalent bonds are, on the whole, distinct from other types of derivative drugs such that the former are uniquely deserving of 'new chemical entity' status and the resulting five-year exclusivity.\" In particular, the court pointed to a 1989 response letter from FDA to a citizen petition. In that letter, the agency explained that \"even minor covalent structure changes are capable of producing not only major changes in the activity of the drug but changes that are not readily predicted.\" Nonetheless, FDA observed that \"the formation of a salt . . . or of an ester, is not intended to, and generally cannot, alter the basic pharmacologic or toxicologic properties of the molecule.\" Accordingly, without holding directly on whether FDA reasonably included other noncovalent derivatives in its active moiety definition, the court held that FDA's exclusion of non-ester covalent derivatives was reasonable. Against this backdrop of decades of complex litigation over FDA's interpretation of active ingredient, three bills have been introduced in the 116th Congress that address this issue. Each proposed legislation would generally (1) codify FDA's interpretation that eligibility for NCE exclusivity should be based on the drug's active moiety and (2) incorporate FDA's definition of active moiety by reference. Specifically, the proposed legislation would do so by replacing the entire phrase \"active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient)\" with \"active moiety (as defined by the Secretary in section 314.3 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations))\" wherever it is found, except for a few provisions that expired in 1984. This change would be made to several FD&C Act provisions, including the NCE exclusivity provision, three-year exclusivity for other changes, and provisions providing priority review vouchers for tropical disease treatments, rare pediatric disease treatments, and countermeasures for agents that threaten national security. Adopting this interpretation would resolve certain legal uncertainties under current case law. In Amarin Pharmaceuticals v. FDA , the court rejected FDA's interpretation but did not explicitly invalidate FDA's regulations. Though it left FDA's interpretation in place, the court's decision left uncertain FDA's ability to defend its interpretation going forward. The proposed legislation would address those questions by adopting FDA's interpretation. The proposed legislation would also resolve the questions that have been raised as to whether FDA's decision to include other noncovalent derivative forms of the molecule in its definition of active moiety, but not other covalent derivatives, accords with congressional intent and a justifiable distinction. The proposed legislation would both adopt FDA's current approach, by incorporating FDA's current definition, and allow FDA to modify its approach going forward as its understanding changed, by including any successor regulations. In effect, the proposed legislation would commit the decision as to which molecules should be deemed effectively the same and therefore not innovative enough to merit NCE exclusivity to FDA's judgment.",
      "summary": "Whether many provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) apply to a particular drug product turns in part on the novelty of the \"active ingredient\" of the drug in question. In particular, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must assess the novelty of the active ingredient in a new drug, comparing it to a previously approved drug's active ingredient to determine whether the new drug qualifies for the five-year \"new chemical entity\" (NCE) exclusivity. FDA generally cannot accept new drug applications that refer to a drug with NCE exclusivity (i.e., rely on its clinical data and FDA's approval of the drug) for five years. Companies that receive approval for drugs with new active ingredients generally enjoy a competitive advantage in the market while the exclusivity is in effect\u00e2\u0080\u0094and after, depending how long it takes for generic versions to receive approval once applications can be submitted. Comparing active ingredients can be technically quite complicated. For instance, compounds in a final drug product may convert to other compounds through chemical reactions inside the body before arriving at the site of the therapeutic effect. In addition, related but distinct drug molecules may be clinically indistinguishable or convert into the same pharmacologically or physiologically active component inside the body. Alternatively, two drug molecules with the same core compound may have different compounds appended to them by either covalent or noncovalent bonds. For example, replacing a hydrogen atom in an acid molecule with \"a metal or its equivalent\" forms a salt, while replacing the hydrogen atom with \"an organic radical\" forms an ester. These derivatives may or may not vary from each other in clinically significant ways. This raises the question of which derivative(s), if any, should be considered to be the same active ingredient as the core or base molecule. Generally, a more expansive interpretation of phrase \"active ingredient,\" that is, one that considers more types of derivatives to be the same active ingredient, reduces the number of drugs eligible for NCE regulatory exclusivity by expanding the drug ingredients considered previously approved, which allows for earlier introduction of generic versions of those drugs. Historically, for the exclusivity provisions, FDA has interpreted \"active ingredient\" to mean \"active moiety,\" as defined by FDA regulations. FDA generally defines active moiety as the core molecule or ion of a drug (i.e., the drug molecule without certain appendages) that is \"responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of a drug substance.\" FDA's interpretation has generated disputes between FDA and pharmaceutical companies, as FDA's approach tends to exclude some drugs from being afforded five-year NCE exclusivity under the FD&C Act. In 2015, a federal district court rejected FDA's interpretation as inconsistent with the statutory language, though it did not explicitly invalidate FDA's regulations. In the 116th Congress, legislation has been introduced that would generally codify FDA's current approach to evaluating NCE exclusivity and extend that approach to certain other provisions under the FD&C Act. This proposed legislation would moot questions about the validity of FDA's interpretation and clarify when chemical entities are sufficiently similar to be considered identical for purposes of drug approval and exclusivity.",

      "document": "in high - income countries , growing numbers of men as well as women are choosing to postpone parenthood . on average , \n if sustained , this demographic shift may have manifold implications for the health of successive generations . \n we discuss here the evidence for a beneficial effect of increasing paternal age at conception ( pac ) on the health of descendants . \n basic genetics offers a strong foundation for hypothesizing that increased pac creates an increased risk for a host of disorders in offspring . in utero \n , the female germ cells undergo an estimated 22 cell divisions before meiosis and two divisions during meiosis . \n however , as only one chromosome replication takes place during meiosis , the female germ cells undergo a total of 23 chromosome replications . \n postnatally , the meiotic process is arrested at the first meiosis and this persists until puberty . \n thus , between the mother 's birth and the conception of her offspring , her germ cells undergo no chromosome replication and only one cell division ( regardless of her age at conception ) . \n for instance , the estimated cumulative numbers of germ - line stem cell ( gsc ) replications in men by the ages of 20 and 40 years are 150 and 610 , respectively . \n it has long been recognised that rare conditions such as achondroplasia ( the prevalence of which is  one per twenty thousand ) and marfan syndrome ( which has a prevalence of  one per five thousand ) may arise from mutations in the male gscs . \n however , in the past decade , a large number of studies have linked increased pac to severe conditions that are not so rare in offspring , including autism , schizophrenia , and other neurodevelopmental disorders . it is often assumed , but not proven , that this is also due to mutations in the male germ line . perhaps because of the gravity of these diseases , \n studies now suggest , however , that older pac may also confer benefits on the health of offspring . \n if increased pac may have both adverse and beneficial effects , understanding the balance of its risks and benefits will require the consideration of a broad scope of relationships between increased pac and offspring health . \n yet we have only just begun to explore the potential benefits of older pac , and the evidence for them is still not widely understood . \n we therefore integrated work done across disciplines to articulate the case for a potentially major benefit of older pac on the basis of an intriguing finding in recent studies that leukocyte telomere length ( ltl ) is on average longer in the offspring of older fathers . \n this association of pac with offspring ltl has no threshold , as it has been observed for increasing pac from the age of 20 up to 60 years . \n as a longer ltl predicts reduced atherosclerotic risk and longer survival in the elderly , it is possible that older fathers , by endowing their offspring with a longer ltl , may also confer on them resistance to atherosclerosis and an advantage for increased longevity . that older pac is related to longer offspring ltl \n , it might even seem counter - intuitive , given the widespread awareness of genetic abnormalities related to both increased maternal age at conception ( e.g. , chromosomal aneuploidy ) and pac ( e.g. , de novo mutations ) . the pac effect on offspring ltl is also perplexing on a deeper level , however , because of what it implies about age - related changes in the male germ line and how they are transmitted to offspring . yet the outcome of these age - related changes , \n namely , longer telomere length ( tl ) , is probably transmitted in mendelian fashion . \n we discuss below how this enigma could be resolved . for understanding of the following discussion \n , it is important to recognize four major aspects of tl in general and ltl in particular . \n first , telomeres are the ttaggg tandem repeats at both ends of each of the mammalian chromosomes , and together with telomere - binding proteins they cap the chromosomes . \n this capping stabilizes the telomere and prevents the chromosomal ends from being recognized by the dna repair processes in cells as dna break points and potential sites of chromosomal fusions . \n second , as somatic cells replicate , their telomeres undergo progressive attrition because dna polymerase can not completely replicate the 3 ' end of linear duplex dna . \n once telomeres become very short , they often cause cells to exit from the replicative cycle and become senescent . third , ltl is a complex human genetic trait in that it is determined by many genes , and its dynamics ( birth ltl and age - dependent telomere attrition thereafter ) reflect telomere dynamics in hematopoietic stem cells . \n fourth , because the hematopoietic system is probably the most proliferative system among somatic tissues , ltl , and by inference tl in hematopoietic stem cells , can become critically short during the long human life course , thereby imposing a limit on the longevity of some individuals . \n the mechanisms underlying the association of pac with the ltl of offspring are not yet understood . \n genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) of ltl have deciphered a number of genes and genetic loci associated with ltl in the general population . \n however , it is very unlikely that the pac effect on offspring ltl is mediated through increased mutation load with age in the paternal germ line . \n such mutations are too rare to explain the pac effect on the offspring ltl , for the reason that the effect of older pac is manifested as a shift to a longer average ltl of the offspring in the population . because there is no corresponding increase in variance of the offspring ltl , \n this population shift does not merely reflect an increase in the small subset of persons with extremely long ltl . an important clue to the causal mechanism of pac on ltl \n is that while telomeres undergo age - dependent shortening in replicating somatic cells , tl is longer in sperm samples donated by older men than in those donated by young ones . \n thus , postulated mechanisms for the pac effect on ltl must ultimately explain the reason for why , on average , sperm cells of older men have longer tls than sperm cells of younger men . \n each sperm is a distinct genetic package , ensuring genetic diversity among a father s offspring . \n age might exert selection pressure at the level of the male gscs such that surviving gscs are those with relatively long telomeres . indeed , there is some evidence for the overrepresentation of sperm with longer telomeres in older men . \n another explanation for the effect of pac on ltl , not mutually exclusive with gsc selection , relates to the age - dependent elongation of telomeres in male gscs . \n this could be due to the difference in telomerase activity between somatic cells and male germ - line cells . \n telomerase activity is repressed after birth in most human somatic cells , including hematopoietic stem cells . by contrast \n , telomerase displays robust activity in embryonic stem cells and in the testes of humans and other mammals , presumably because the enzyme is active in male gscs . \n the activity of telomerase is usually fine - tuned to maintain the length of telomeres constant in telomerase - positive cells . \n it seems , however , that a small increase in tl ( only a few base pairs ) occurs with each replication of gsc in males , suggesting that in these cells telomerase overshoots its mark . \n because of the high number of replications of male gscs , a small elongation would result in considerable lengthening of sperm - cell tl over many replications . \n although sperm have a long tl , the tl of mammalian oocytes is relatively short and is evidently \n however , regardless of mechanisms that affect tl in the embryo and fetus , human tl is evidently inherited in an allele - specific manner . \n accordingly , ordinary mendelian principles would seem to suggest that since a child receives roughly half of its dna from its father , the slope of its ltl vs. pac should be approximately one half of the slope of tl in sperm vs. the ages of the sperm donors . \n the magnitude of the pac effect on offspring ltl is large , at 1520 base pairs of a longer ltl in the offspring for each year of pac . \n this is close to the average rate of age - dependent ltl attrition in adulthood , of 2030 base pairs per year . \n moreover , the pac effect on offspring ltl appears to be cumulative across successive generations . \n given the considerable magnitude of the pac effect on offspring ltl and its additive nature across successive generations , current demographic trends of an upward shift in paternal age might affect tl in future humans . from this standpoint , the pac effect on ltl is also directly relevant to the biological limit of human longevity . \n short human telomeres could , in theory , impose a limit on human longevity , but the pac effect suggests that human tl is malleable . \n it is therefore essential to factor in the pac effect on tl dynamics in the offspring when considering the question of whether life expectancy is approaching its ultimate ceiling in modern humans . \n the large magnitude of the pac effect on offspring ltl also suggests that it could be worthwhile to use this knowledge to explore possibilities for improving population health . before doing that , however , it is necessary to answer some basic questions about pac and ltl in life - course and cross - generational epidemiological studies . \n the main determinants of ltl at any age are ltl at birth and the magnitude of its attrition during growth . yet \n the hypothesis of mendelian transmission of a longer tl from the paternal germ line to the offspring predicts that offspring of older fathers would be conceived with a longer tl . by the time of conception , the tl of the paternal germ line \n would already have been lengthened by gsc selection or age - related elongation or both , and this longer tl would be inherited by the offspring . but this prediction of mendelian inheritance of epigenetic changes has not yet been tested , leaving open the question of whether there might be some more complex process by which pac exerts a latent effect on ltl that becomes evident in utero or during the first two decades of life . \n we have noted above that increased pac is associated with rare mutations and related diseases . if increased pac also has beneficial effects on offspring health via increased tl \n , then we need to pose the following question : might the pac effect be understood from the perspective of natural forces that shape human biology with respect not only to disease but also to evolutionary fitness ? \n evolutionary theories suggest that delayed reproduction leads to increased longevity because of larger investment in maintenance and repair . this feature has been displayed in model organisms . \n for instance , selection based on delayed reproduction causes a pronounced increase in the lifespan of the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster . because increased pac reflects delayed reproduction in humans , and longer ltl might predict increased lifespan \n , the pac effect may be a manifestation in humans of the same phenomenon as seen in the fruit fly . \n moreover , in aging male fruit flies , the number of gscs is much smaller than that in younger male flies . \n such a phenomenon may be the result of a stochastic depletion of gscs or may reflect the ability of surviving gscs to withstand the accruing burden of aging - related stress , primarily in the form of oxidative stress . \n the variant genetic and more likely epigenetic constitution that distinguishes the surviving gscs from the non - surviving ones might provide a potential mechanism for transmitting increased fitness and longevity from fathers to offspring . \n studies across a variety of species suggest that tl and the expression of telomerase activity in somatic tissues have been fashioned by evolutionary forces . \n consider , for instance , the body sizes of terrestrial mammals ( among which humans are viewed as moderately sized mammals ) and their life spans . \n increased mammalian body size is associated with repression of telomerase , whereas increase in life span is associated with shorter telomeres . \n humans , the longest - living terrestrial mammals , have short telomeres and repressed telomerase activity in their somatic cells during extra - uterine life . in principle , tl might hence curtail lifespan in humans to a greater extent than in other mammals . \n a postulated evolutionary explanation for repressed telomerase activity with increased body size and diminished tl with increased life span is that these features protect against cancer through the reproductive phase of the life span . \n because somatic cells from relatively large and long - living mammals tend to undergo many more replications for growth and maintenance than do those of small , short - living mammals , they should be subject to a greater risk of cancer . \n thus far , however , there is no empirical evidence for associations of cancer risk with body size or longevity among mammals . in this context \n , little is known about the effect among humans of inter - individual variation in tl with respect to the cost of having relatively short telomeres ( perhaps less cancer risk early in life and more cardiovascular disease risk later in life ) or long telomeres ( perhaps more cancer risk early in life and less cardiovascular disease risk later in life ) . \n the pac effect on the health of offspring and , more broadly , on public health , requires fundamental re - thinking and new directions in research . \n insight into this phenomenon and its links to human telomere biology will significantly advance the understanding of aging - related diseases in modern humans . \n overall , the evidence supports the view that in some contexts the male germ line might drive the evolution of human tl . \n if so , this would represent a substantial addition to haldane s conceptualization of the evolutionary force of male - biased mutations and the subsequent recognition that the evolution of dna sequences is largely driven through the numerous replications of the male germ line . because tl at birth and its rapid attrition during early life strongly influence tl throughout the human life course , an understanding of the pac effect on offspring tl requires going straight to the source , namely , tl at birth and its attrition during childhood . ongoing studies , exemplified by the avon longitudinal study of parents and children ( alspac ) in the uk and the norwegian mother and child cohort study ( moba ) , might be used to achieve this goal in a cost - effective manner . \n lastly , it is clear that the enigma of the father s age and the health of his offspring are bound to engage telomere researchers , evolutionary biologists , epidemiologists , and demographers for quite some time .",
      "summary": "what are the implications for population health of the demographic trend toward increasing paternal age at conception ( pac ) in modern societies ? \n we propose that the effects of older pac are likely to be broad and harmful in some domains of health but beneficial in others . \n harmful effects of older pac have received the most attention . \n thus , for example , older pac is associated with an increased risk of offspring having rare conditions such as achondroplasia and marfan syndrome , as well as with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism . \n however , newly emerging evidence in the telomere field suggests potentially beneficial effects , since older pac is associated with a longer leukocyte telomere length ( ltl ) in offspring , and a longer ltl is associated with a reduced risk of atherosclerosis and with increased survival in the elderly . \n thus , older pac may cumulatively increase resistance to atherosclerosis and lengthen lifespan in successive generations of modern humans . in this paper \n we : ( i ) introduce these novel findings ; ( ii ) discuss potential explanations for the effect of older pac on offspring ltl ; ( iii ) draw implications for population health and for life course ; ( iv ) put forth an evolutionary perspective as a context for the multigenerational effects of pac ; and ( v ) call for broad and intensive research to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of pac . \n we draw together work across a range of disciplines to offer an integrated perspective of this issue .",

tnf agents have shown good efficacy in treating refractory ra , especially when methotrexate ( mtx ) and disease - modifying anti - rheumatic drugs ( dmards ) proved ineffective . as the first clinically approved tnf blocker , infliximab has been widely used in ra treatment . however , approximately 30% of ra patients achieved inadequate response . \n clinical parameters related with ra diagnosis or prognosis , such as c - reactive protein ( crp ) and disease activity score 28 ( das28 ) , failed to predict clinical response to infliximab . \n thus , considering the high cost , adverse effects , and prolonged disease severity in non -

throughput gene detection technology , gene expression profiling has been used in identifying genes associated with disease diagnosis , prognosis , and treatment . \n several studies tested the mrna expression profiles in peripheral blood samples from ra patients before infliximab treatment , and detected gene panels discriminating between future responders and non - responders . \n although synovial biopsy samples could reflect the degree of inflammation at a specific joint and the response to infliximab more directly , it was difficult to obtain such samples , particularly from multiple sites and at different time points . \n the most common approach to searching for biomarkers is to identify individual genes showing statistically significant differences between responders and non - responders . after systematic analyses \n , we found that differential genes identified in these studies were not consistent with each other , and different gene sets were reported to distinguish between responders and non - responders . \n first , most studies were limited in sample size , and the response criteria varied from studies ( acr , eular , serum crp , or dai ) . \n different platforms contained different gene - oriented probes , and not all platforms were well - annotated . \n sampling , rna amplification and labeling , and the hybridization conditions might also affect the results . \n thus , we analyzed the differential genes associated with the subsequent infliximab efficacy according to the criteria of each study . \n considering that there was no overlap of differential genes across all 8 studies , the genes recognized by at least half of the studies were chosen as candidate biomarkers . \n then , 2 random - prospective - designed datasets were used to test the predictive power of candidate biomarkers . \n five genes were identified for the validation ( fkbp1a , fgf12 , ano1 , lrrc31 , and akr1d1 ) . \n gene ontology analysis indicated that the 5 genes were significantly associated with the regulation of transmembrane transport . however , no single gene showed good predictive power , but the 5-gene model of logistics regression had an accurate prediction at baseline , as well as at the early phrase of treatment . currently , most , if not all , therapeutic effect prediction studies focused on the predictive values of single genes rather than multiple genes . \n our study indicated an excellent performance of joint prediction by multiple genes , which could also illuminate the low predictive values of differential genes in eligible studies . \n first , we believe this is the first systematic study to identify the circulating biomarkers for predicting ra infliximab response through bioinformatics analysis of the microarray data from public databases . \n second , a 5-gene model was established and showed good predictive power , and it was also applicable at the early phrase of treatment . \n the models of fkbp1a , fgf12 , ano1 , lrrc31 , and akr1d1 in peripheral blood is useful for efficiently predicting the response to infliximab treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients .",

      "document": "osteosarcoma is a malignancy of mesenchymal cells that have the ability to produce osteoid or immature bone . \n osteosarcoma of the head and neck is relatively rare and constitutes only around 8.4% of all osteosarcomas , while in the jaw there is an estimated incidence of 0.7 per million population . \n gnathic osteosarcomas are broadly categorized into central ( intramedullary ) and peripheral ( surface ) subtypes . \n surface tumors are further divided into parosteal well - differentiated ( low - grade ) , periosteallow- to intermediate - grade and high - grade surface osteosarcomas . in 1949 , geschickter and copeland were the first to describe parosteal osteosarcomas under the heading of  parosteal osteoma  a group of parosteal bone tumors of which the seemingly benign clinical and histologic aspect was belied by frequent relapse and metastasis . \n unni et al . , defined the juxtacortical osteosarcoma as  a distinctive type of malignant bone tumor that originates on external surface of the bone specifically in relation to periosteum and/or immediate connective tissue . \n the first report of parosteal osteosarcoma in craniofacial site was reported in 1961 by som and peimer . \n it has predilection to occur in the 2and 4decade mainly affecting   distal femur . in the long bones females have a greater risk than men ( 3:2 ) , whereas in jaws men are more affected as ( 1.75:1 ) compared to women . in the jaws \n it can be mistaken for benign lesions as the clinical behavior and radiographic appearances are usually benign . \n histologically , parosteal osteosarcoma is well - differentiated and is characterized by spindle cell stroma with minimal atypia and rare mitotic figures separating irregular trabeculae of woven bone . \n parosteal osteosarcoma of craniofacial area behave similar to long bone counterparts with slow growth and low grade malignancy that do not tend to metastasize . \n this paper describes a case of parosteal osteosarcoma and emphasizes the need for differential diagnosis of this rare entity with benign reactive and neoplastic osseous lesions . \n a 22-year - old female patient presented with the complaint of swelling in the right side of the face since 9 months , which was not associated with pain , discharge or neurological symptoms . \n on extraoral examination , diffuse swelling of about 4  4 cm in midface region was noted on the right side of the face . \n intraorally , swelling involved right maxillary buccal aspect of the ridge from second premolar to third molar measuring around 3.5  2.5 cm in dimensions , extending anterioposteriorly from the mesial aspect of maxillary second premolar to distal aspect of third molar and superioinferiorly from the marginal gingival level to the vestibule causing obliteration , without any palatal expansion . \n exophytic bony swelling on right maxillary alveolar ridge occlusal radiograph revealed   dome - shaped swelling with radiopaque shadow and patchy radiopacity on buccal aspect of maxilla [ figure 2 ] . \n axial and coronal computed tomography ( ct ) scans revealed well - defined , hyperdense bony mass with patchy radiopacity emanating from the buccal cortical plate with broad base . \n three - dimensional ct ( 3d - ct ) showed lobulated exophytic bony mass attached with broad base to the buccal cortical plate formed by the network of multiple inter   coalescing striae of trabeculae [ figure 3c ] . \n the h and e stained sections showed parallel array of bony trabeculae in a background of spindle cells and angular cells which showed minimal atpia . \n areas of osteoid admist the angular and spindle cells were also detected [ figures 4 - 6 ] . \n the patient was treated with partial maxillectomy and is under follow - up since the past 1.5 years . \n occlusal view showing well - defined radiopaque lesion with patchy radiopacity ( a ) axial ct showing hyperdense radiopaque lesion , slightly dense at base than at periphery . \n ( c ) 3d - ct showing exophytic bony mass showing network of multiple intercoalescing radiating striae . \n 3d - ct = three - dimensional computed tomography irregular osteoid matrix separated by spindle and angular cells . \n ( h&e stain , 100 ) photomicrograph showing thick often parallel ( streamers ) array of bony trabeculae in a spindle stroma . \n parosteal osteogenic sarcoma is an uncommon malignant tumor . in a large case series of 998 osteosarcomas of entire skeleton , dahlin et al . \n bras et al . , reviewed seven cases of gnathic parosteal osteosarcomas of which five were reported in mandible and two in maxilla with an average age of 35.4 years . \n simon et al . , in there view of 12 parosteal osteosarcomas , reported five in maxillary and seven in mandibular region with an average age of 34 years . a peak incidence between the ages of 20 and 30 years with 2:3 male to female ratio \n however , we report parosteal osteosarcoma in a 22-year - old female patient , in the maxillary region . \n to date only 27 cases of juxtacortical osteosarcomas have been reported of which 12 were of parosteal variant , nine were of periosteal variant and six were of periosteal / parosteal type . \n the present case brings the total number of parosteal osteosarcomas of jaws to 13 , a rarity in itself in the literature . \n concurrent with the literature presenting features in our case were a painless , slowly growing , exophytic osseous swelling with nonlobular outer surface . \n pain was mentioned as dull aching in half of the reported cases and it appeared as exophytic hard nodule on the attached gingiva appearing as soft tissue epulides mimicking benign osseous proliferative growth . occasionally surface ulceration was noted . \n radiographically , parosteal osteosarcomas are radiodense , lobulated , cauliflower - like or oval masses with a broad stalk attached to the external cortex of the underlying bone . \n parosteal variant is considered to arise from the outer layer of cortex , therefore does not elevate the periosteum like periosteal variant . between underlying bone and the tumor , a thin radiolucent cleavage plane called  string sign  , \n a characteristic but not a constant finding , is seen in only 30% of the cases . \n string sign  is a radiolucent line histopathologically corresponding to unmineralized thickened periosteum interposed between the cortex and the tumor mass . \n it is more difficult to demonstrate in the jaws because their anatomical form does not allow the necessary radiographic projections to be obtained . \n various other radiographic patterns like cotton wool image with distinct margin , patchy radiopacity and tumor mass with diffuse hazy opacification with few fine bony spicules radiating from the lower border of the lesion also have been reported . \n in contrast , periosteal osteosarcoma presents with a radiographically intact cortex with no involvement of the underlying marrow cavity . \n the tumor matrix is not as radiographically dense or homogenous as parosteal osteosarcoma and has a poorly defined periphery . since treatment and prognosis varies with both the variants of surface osteosarcomas , radiologic differentiation is important . \n computerized tomography scan helps to demonstrate the tumor confinement , attachment to the cortex and involvement of marrow . \n ct and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) images are extremely useful for staging , detecting the presence of cortical erosion , regions of dedifferentiation , intramedullary extension or satellite lesions in the surrounding soft tissues . \n scintigraphy and chest ct are useful in confirming the solitary nature of the tumor and absence of metastatic disease . in the present case , \n many interlacing coalescing trabeculae of varying thickness forming a meshwork from the lower border of the intact cortex as seen in 3dct was an interesting finding not reported in previous cases . \n radiographic differential diagnosis includes tori , exostosis and peripheral osteomas more commonly ; and other rare entities like nora 's lesion ( bizarre periosteal ossifying periostitis ) , osteochondroma , myositis ossificans and hyperostosis . \n tori and exostosis occurring at the same site are painless , slow growing masses with limited growth potential and can attach to cortex of jaw via pedicle or wide base . often the correct diagnosis is established on histologic basis . peripheral osteomas tend to be more radiodense because of absence of cartilagenous areas and the rare trabeular straie tend to be fine and closer together , like the edge of the feather . \n however , the aggressive behavior with rapid expansion and medullary involvement should help in ruling out their presence . \n osteochondroma , a rare entity in jaws , shows continuity of cortex and underlying medullary bone with the base of the lesion . \n hyperostosis , an uncommon lesion encountered under the pontics in the posterior region can be confused with parosteal variant . \n histologically , it is well - differentiated and characterized by spindle cell stroma with minimal atypia and rare mitotic figures separating irregular trabeculae of woven bone . with time , the trabeculae often coalesce and form a large mass of solid bone . about 4050% of parosteal osteosarcomas exhibit foci of cartilage . in the present case \n fine lace - like osteoid tissues were present among hyperchromatic tumor cells with foci of cartilaginous tissue . \n microscopic evaluation of the specimen helps in screening the dedifferentiation areas and areas that represent high grade behavior . \n approximately 10% of parosteal osteosarcomas dedifferentiate to high - grade osteosarcoma with a corresponding worsening of prognosis . the histologic differential diagnosis of parosteal osteogenic sarcoma of the jaws includes nora 's lesion , benign fibro - osseous lesions like fibrous dysplasia and ossifying fibroma , low - grade intraosseous osteosarcomas and osteomas . \n nora 's lesion histopathologically shows characteristic cartilage capping and distinct zones which distinguishes it from parosteal osteosarcoma . \n fibrous dysplasia and ossifying fibroma apart from their histopathology , the intramedullary location negates the possibility of them in differential diagnosis . \n osteoma in conjunction with mature bone lacks the spindle cell proliferation seen in parosteal osteogenic sarcoma and do not show cellular polymorphism , anaplasia and mitotic activity . \n low - grade intraosseous osteosarcoma shows overlapping histologic features with parosteal osteosarcoma . in most of the cases , \n minimal local reccurence occurs with wide excision of adjacent bone and periosteum by removing satellite lesions and preventing local spread along the bone surface . \n now , chemotherapy following wide excision is the recommended treatment protocol for recurrent cases and those exhibiting highly malignant features on histological examination . \n low - grade parosteal osteosarcoma has an overall good prognosis and has low metastatic potential . \n local control is more limited in the maxilla than the mandible and thus mandibular parosteal osteosarcomas overall have better prognosis than those of the maxilla . \n therefore maxilla has high recurrent rate . with the number of recurrences , the incidence of intramedullary involvement and dedifferentiation to high - grade sarcoma increases . to conclude \n , this case illustrates the importance of correlation of clinical , radiological and histopathological features in confirming the diagnosis of parosteal osteosarcoma . because of the less aggressive biological behavior",

      "document": "Local governments have traditionally played an important role in regulating cable television systems. Operators required municipal permission to place their cables above or beneath streets and other publicly owned land and to mount the cables on telephone/and or utility poles. Cities negotiated with cable operators over the services their systems would provide, including channels dedicated to public, educational, or government programming (PEG), and the payment of franchise fees. In exchange, the cable operators often received de facto exclusive local franchises to offer video distribution services. That changed in 1984, when Congress required local governments to allow competition. In the mid-2000s, as telephone companies (known as \" telcos \") sought to obtain their own video services franchises, state governments got involved to streamline the franchising process, in several instances preempting municipalities' authority. The states applied these laws to incumbent cable operators as well as to new entrants, to ensure legal parity. As technological developments and changes in business strategies and consumer behavior have reshaped the telecommunications industry, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken several steps to limit local regulatory authority over cable and telco video service providers. Many of these regulatory changes have caused controversy. Some local governments assert that, among other things, the FCC's actions will limit their ability to protect the public interest and deprive them of revenue. This report examines the evolving relationship between federal, state, and local regulators and identifies related policy issues that may be of interest to Congress. Cable television began operating in the 1940s as a means to receive broadcast signals in areas with trees or mountains that interfered with over-the-air signal transmission. Initially, municipalities, rather than states, made most decisions related to awarding cable franchises. As cable television developed, some states began to regulate the terms included in a cable franchise, or required state review or approval of a franchise agreement. The term local franchising authorities (LFAs) refers to municipal and/or state government entities that offer and negotiate video franchises. Today, agreements between LFAs and video service providers typically include provisions concerning the availability of channels for PEG programming; the amount of money due to the LFA in franchise fees, including in-kind contributions; and the rates charged to subscribers. The Communications Act of 1934 (referred to in this report as the Communications Act) created the FCC, but did not specifically set forth the FCC's authority to regulate cable. However, the U.S. Supreme Court found in 1968 that the agency's authority was sufficiently broad to do so. The FCC issued comprehensive regulations governing cable systems and cable franchising authorities in 1972. The FCC's rules directed cable operators to offer PEG services and LFAs to cap franchise fees. In the early days of cable television, a municipal government seeking to bring cable to its residents would, through a request for proposals, spell out the requirements that a cable operator would have to meet to win the franchise. Cable companies would bid against one another for the chance to wire the municipality. Renewal of an existing franchise might entail additional requirements. In 1972, the FCC directed cable operators to dedicate one channel for public access, one channel for educational use, and one channel for local government use by a certain date, and to add channel capacity if necessary to meet the requirement. Two years later, however, the commission reconsidered its stance, stating, Demands are being made not only for excessive amounts of free equipment but also free programming and engineering personnel to man the equipment. Cable subscribers are being asked to subsidize the local school system, government, and access groups. This was not our intent and may, in fact, hamper our efforts at fostering cable technology on a nationwide scale. Too often these extra equipment and personnel demands become franchise bargaining chips rather than serious community access efforts. We are very hopeful that our access experiment will work.... We do not think, however, that simply putting more demands on the cable operator will make public access a success. Access will only work, we suspect, when the rest of the community assumes its responsibility to use the opportunity it has been provided. Although the U.S. Supreme Court later struck down the FCC's rules requiring cable operators to set aside channels for PEGs, PEG access requirements became commonplace in local franchise agreements by the early 1980s. Congress encouraged this development. According to a 1984 report from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Public access channels are often the video equivalent of the speaker's soapbox or the electronic parallel to the printed leaflet. They provide groups and individuals who generally have not had access to the electronic media with the opportunity to become sources of information in the electronic marketplace of ideas. PEG channels also contribute to an informed citizenry by bringing local schools into the home, and by showing the public local government at work. In addition to requiring cable system owners to obtain a franchise before operating, municipalities also required cable system owners to pay a franchise fee . In its 1972 Cable Order, the FCC stated, [M]any local authorities appear to have extracted high franchise fees more for revenue-raising than for regulatory purposes. Most fees are about five or six percent, but some have been known to run as high as 36 percent. The ultimate effect of any revenue-raising fee is to levy an indirect and regressive tax on cable subscribers. Second, and of great importance to the Commission, high local franchise fees may burden cable television to the extent that it will be unable to carry out its part in our national communications policy.... We are seeking to strike a balance that permits the achievement of federal goals and at the same time allows adequate revenues to defray the costs of local regulation. To accomplish this balance, the FCC capped the franchise fees at 3%-5% of a cable operator's revenues from subscribers. For fees greater than 3% of an operator's subscriber revenues, the FCC required a franchising authority to submit a showing that the specified fee was \"appropriate in light of the planned local regulatory program.\" When cable television first developed as essentially an antenna service to improve over-the-air broadcast television signal reception in rural and suburban areas, many municipalities regulated the rates charged to subscribers. The municipalities viewed rate regulation, tied to the systems' use of public streets, as a means of preventing cable operators from charging unreasonably high rates for what they viewed as an essential service. In the 1972 Cable Order, the FCC required franchising authorities to specify or approve initial rates for cable television services regularly furnished to all subscribers and to institute a program for the review and, as necessary, adjustment of rates. In 1976, the FCC repealed those rules and instead made LFA regulation of rates for cable television services optional. In 1974, the FCC preempted LFAs from regulating rates for other so-called \"specialized services,\" including \"advertising, pay services, digital services, [and] alarm systems.\" In the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 ( P.L. 98-549 , referred to in this report as the 1984 Cable Act), Congress added Title VI to the Communications Act to give the FCC explicit authority to regulate cable television. The 1984 Cable Act established the local franchising process as the primary means of cable television regulation. The act did not diminish state and local authority to regulate matters of public health, safety, and welfare; system construction; and consumer protection for cable subscribers. Congress enacted the 1984 Cable Act the same year that American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T), which had an effective monopoly over most telecommunications services, spun off its regional operating companies as part of the settlement of a federal antitrust suit. The 1984 Cable Act generally prohibited telcos from providing video services in the same regions where they provided voice services. This prohibition prevented the former AT&T companies from competing with cable operators in communities where they controlled the local telephone system. The 1984 Cable Act confirmed the power of state and municipal governments to include requirements for PEGs, facilities and equipment, and certain aspects of program content within franchise agreements. It delineated federal limits on franchise fees, and restricted the FCC's power to regulate the amount of franchise fees or the use of funds derived from those fees. The law permits franchising authorities to charge franchise fees, but limits such fees to no more than 5% of the cable operators' gross revenues from \"cable services.\" For the purposes of calculating gross revenues, the FCC included revenues from advertising and home shopping commissions, in addition to revenues from video service subscriptions. Subsequently, as described in \" FCC Actions Affecting State and Local Video Service Franchising Terms and Conditions ,\" defining the costs that are subject to the 5% statutory limit on franchise fees became a point of repeated controversy. The 1984 Cable Act allows local franchising authorities to enforce any PEG access requirements in a franchise agreement. Such terms and conditions can include providing video production facilities and equipment, paying capital costs related to PEG facilities beyond the 5% franchise fee cap, and paying costs associated with support of PEG channel use. In addition, the 1984 Cable Act permitted LFAs to require cable operators to designate channels for PEGs on institutional networks (I-Nets) provided for public buildings and other nonresidential subscribers. Section 623 of the 1984 Cable Act (47 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7543) prohibits federal, state, or local franchising authorities from regulating the rates of cable operators that are \"subject to effective competition,\" as defined by the FCC. The 1984 Cable Act directs the FCC to review its standards for determining effective competition periodically, taking into account developments in technology. In 1985, the FCC determined that cable systems generally were subject to \"effective competition\" if they operated in an areas where three or more broadcast television signals were either \"significantly viewed\" by residents or transmitted with acceptable signal quality (as defined by the FCC) to the cable systems' franchise areas. In accordance with the timetable set by the 1984 Cable Act, the \"effective competition\" rule became effective on December 29, 1986. This rule effectively deregulated cable prices in most communities. In 1991, the FCC adopted a new definition of \"effective competition.\" The FCC deemed effective competition to exist if either: 1. six unduplicated broadcast signals were available to the cable operator's franchise area via over-the-air reception, or 2. another multichannel video service, such as a satellite service, was available to at least 50% of homes to which cable services were available (homes passed), and was subscribed to by 10% of the cable operator's homes passed. Under this more restrictive definition, most systems were still subject to effective competition and therefore not subject to rate regulation. In the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-385 , referred to here as the 1992 Cable Act), Congress stated the policy goal of relying on market forces, to the maximum extent feasible, to promote the availability of a diversity of views and information through cable television and other video distribution media. Congress emphasized the importance of protecting consumer interests where cable systems are not subject to effective competition, and of ensuring that cable operators do not have undue market power vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis video programmers and consumers. The 1992 Cable Act revised Section 621(a)(1) of the Communications Act to codify restraints on local franchise authorities' licensing activities. While local authorities retained the power to grant cable franchises, the law provided that \"a franchising authority may not grant an exclusive franchise and may not unreasonably refuse to award an additional competitive franchise.\" Congress gave potential entrants a judicial remedy by enabling them to commence an action in a federal or state court within 120 days after a local authority refused to grant them a franchise. In addition, Congress made it easier for local authorities to regulate cable rates by adopting a more restrictive definition of \"effective competition\" than the FCC's. Pursuant to these changes, local authorities may not regulate cable rates if at least one of the following four conditions is met: 1. fewer than 30% of the households in the franchise area subscribe to a particular cable service; 2. within the franchise area, a. at least two unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) each offer comparable video programming to at least 50% of the households in the franchise area, and b. at least 15% of households subscribe to an MVPD other than the largest one; 3. an MVPD owned by the franchising authority offers video programming to at least 50% of the households in the franchise area; or 4. a telephone company offering local voice services (known as a \"local exchange carrier\" [LEC]) or its affiliate, \"(or any multichannel video programming distributor using the facility of such carrier or its affiliate)\" carries comparable video programming services directly to subscribers by any means (other than direct-to-home satellite services) in the franchise area of an unaffiliated cable operator that is providing video service in that franchise area. Congress directed the FCC to publish a survey of cable rates annually. Even as the 1992 Cable Act took effect, a combination of technological, economic, and legal factors was enabling the convergence of the previously separate telephone, cable, and satellite broadcasting industries. Digital technology, particularly the ability to compress digital signals, enabled both direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services and cable operators to offer dozens of channels. In 1993, the telephone company Bell Atlantic successfully challenged, on First Amendment grounds, the 1984 ban on cross-ownership of telephone and cable companies in the same local market. In the meantime, several cable operators sought to gain economies of scale by consolidating local systems into regional systems. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-104 ), Congress permitted LECs to offer video services and cable operators to offer voice services. Because laws and regulations pertaining to cable systems were quite different from those pertaining to LECs, the prospect of greater competition between those two types of providers led Congress to revisit video market regulation. Moreover, Section 601 rescinded the 1982 consent decree that required the breakup of AT&T, thereby allowing LECs to consolidate further by subsequently merging with long-distance service providers and each other. The act stipulated that cable operators do not need to obtain approval of local authorities that regulate their video services in order to offer \"telecommunications services,\" such as voice services. The Senate Commerce Committee noted that these changes did not affect existing federal or state authority with respect to telecommunications services. It stated that the committee intended that local governments, when exercising their authority to manage their public rights of way, regulate telecommunications services provided by cable companies in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner. Congress used the term \"open video systems\" (OVS) in the 1996 Telecommunications Act (\u00c2\u00a7653) to describe LECs that soughtto compete with cable operators. The act explicitly exempted OVS service from franchise fees and other 1992 Cable Act requirements, including the requirement to obtain a local franchise. In 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit interpreted the provision to mean that, while the federal government could no longer require OVS operators to obtain a local franchise, state and local authorities could nevertheless do so. In 2003, several telephone companies, most notably Southwestern Bell Company (now AT&T) and Verizon, began constructing fiber networks designed to bring consumers advanced digital services, including video. AT&T and Verizon branded these services as \"U-Verse\" and \"FiOS,\" respectively. Neither company launched video services under the OVS rules, claiming that federal requirements and potential local franchise requirements were too costly. In 2006, a federal district court in California dismissed AT&T's claims that municipalities were violating federal law by attempting to exercise franchise authority over the company's video services. The court declined, however, to rule on whether video delivered over internet protocol, the technology used by LECs, met the federal definition of a cable service. Two bills introduced that year in the 109 th Congress, H.R. 5252 and S. 2686 , would have declared that video service enabled via internet protocol is subject only to federal regulation. Congress did not vote on either bill. As the LECs sought to enter the video distribution market, they pursued statewide reforms to speed their entry, rather than seeking franchises in individual municipalities. The LECs' competitors, the incumbent cable operators, contended that state-level franchising would present new entrants with fewer obligations than cable companies had faced when they entered the market, specifically the obligation to build networks serving all parts of a community. In 2005, Texas became the first of several states to replace local franchising with a state-level regime for video service providers, with the express purpose of facilitating entry by new competitors. As Table 1 illustrates, many other states have since either replaced municipal franchising with state-level franchising or offered providers a choice. Since 2007, the FCC has repeatedly revisited the authority of states and LFAs to franchise and regulate video service providers. This process culminated in two orders issued in 2019. One (the \"2019 LFA 3 rd R&O\") sharply limits state and local authority over products offered by video service providers other than video programming. The other order (the \"2019 Effective Competition Order\") determined that AT&T's streaming service, AT&T TV NOW, meets the LEC test component of Congress's effective local competition definition and therefore provides effective competition to a local cable operator. In 2007, the FCC found that the local franchising process constituted an unreasonable barrier to new entrants in the marketplace for video services and to their deployment of high-speed internet service. The FCC adopted rules and guidance covering cities and counties that grant cable franchises. However, the agency stated that it lacked sufficient information regarding whether to apply the rules and guidance to state governments that either issued franchises at the statewide level or had enacted laws governing specific aspects of the franchising process. Consequently, the FCC stated that while it would preempt local laws, it would not preempt state laws covering video franchises. The FCC determined that unless certain specified costs, fees, and other compensation required by LFAs are counted toward the statutory 5% cap on franchise fees, an LFA's demand for such fees represents an unreasonable refusal to award a competitive franchise to a new entrant. In addition, the FCC found that some LFAs had required new entrants to make \"in-kind\" payments or contributions that are unrelated to the provision of cable services. The FCC stated that any requests by LFAs for in-kind contributions that are unrelated to the provision of cable services by a new competitive entrant are subject to the statutory 5% franchise fee cap. The FCC contended that disputes between LFAs and new entrants over LFA-mandated contributions in support of PEG services and equipment could lead to unreasonable refusals by LFAs to award competitive franchises. It determined that costs related to supporting the use of PEG access facilities, including but not limited to salaries and training, are subject to the 5% cap, but that capital costs \"incurred in or associated with the construction of PEG access facilities\" are excluded from the cap. The FCC stated that the LFAs' jurisdiction over LECs and other new entrants applies only to the provision of video services. Specifically, it stated that an LFA cannot use its video franchising authority to attempt to regulate a LEC's entire network beyond the provision of video services. In addition, the FCC found that the following LFA actions constitute an unreasonable refusal to award video franchises to new entrants: 1. failure to issue a decision on a competitive application within the time frames specified in the FCC's order; 2. refusal to grant a competitive franchise because of an applicant's unwillingness to agree to \"unreasonable\" build-out requirements; and 3. denying an application based upon a new entrant's refusal to undertake certain obligations relating to PEGs and I-Nets. In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the FCC's rules. In November 2007, the FCC issued a Second Report and Order that extended the application of several of these rules to local procedures to renew incumbent cable operators' franchises. Specifically, the FCC determined that the rules addressing LFAs' franchise fees, PEG and institutional network obligations, and non-cable-related services and facilities should apply to incumbent operators. It concluded, however, that FCC rules setting time limits on LFAs' franchising decisions and limiting LFA build-out requirements should not apply to incumbent cable operators. Several LFAs petitioned the FCC to reconsider and clarify its Second Report and Order. In 2015, the FCC issued an Order on Reconsideration in which it set forth additional details about its rules with the stated purposes of promoting competition in video services and accelerating broadband deployment. Following the 2015 Order on Reconsideration, the following policies were in place. The FCC clarified that its rules and regulations on franchising applied to city and county LFAs only, not to state-level laws or decisions. The FCC stated that it lacked sufficient information about the state-level franchising process, and suggested that if parties wished the agency to revisit this issue in the future, they should provide evidence that doing so would achieve Congress's policy goals. The FCC included in-kind contributions from incumbent cable operators that were unrelated to the provision of video services within the statutory 5% franchise fee cap. Likewise, the FCC found that payments made by cable operators to support PEG access facilities are subject to the 5% cap, unless they fall under the FCC's definition of \"capital costs\" associated with the construction of PEG facilities. The FCC made in-kind contributions related to cable services subject to the cap on franchise fees for new entrants as well as for cable incumbents. The FCC determined that LFAs' jurisdiction to regulate incumbent cable operators' services is limited to video services, and does not include voice or data services. In addition, the FCC found the following LFA actions do not per se constitute an unreasonable refusal to award video franchises to cable incumbents, although they did for new entrants: 1. denying an application based upon an incumbent's refusal to undertake certain obligations relating to PEGs and institutional networks; 2. failure to issue a decision on a competitive application within the time frames specified in the FCC's order; and 3. refusal to grant a competitive franchise because of an applicant's unwillingness to agree to unreasonable build-out requirements. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit addressed challenges by LFAs to the 2007 Second Report and Order and the 2015 Order on Reconsideration. The court found that the FCC had made sufficiently clear that its rules only apply to city and county LFAs and did not bind state franchising authorities. It determined that the FCC had correctly concluded that noncash contributions could be included in its interpretation of \"franchise fee\" subject to the 5% limit. However, the court held that the FCC had neither explained why the statutory text allowed inclusion of in-kind cable-related contributions within the 5% cap nor defined what \"in-kind\" meant. It found that the FCC offered no basis for barring local franchising authorities from regulating the provision of \"non-telecommunications\" services by incumbent cable providers. It directed the FCC to set forth a valid statutory basis, \"if there is one,\" for applying its rule to the franchising of cable incumbents. The court used the term \"non-telecommunications\" service rather than \"non-video\" or \"non-cable\" service, differing from the distinctions the FCC made with respect to LFAs' authority. The FCC responded to the court's directives in 2018, and once again proposed rules governing the franchising of cable incumbents. On August 1, 2019, the FCC adopted its Third Report and Order (R&O). The FCC stated that its rules would ensure a more level playing field between new entrants and incumbent cable operators and accelerate deployment of \"advanced telecommunications capability\" by preempting local regulations that \"impose an undue economic burden\" on video service providers. The FCC stated that the franchise fees rulings are prospective. That is, video operators may count only ongoing and future in-kind contributions toward the 5% franchise fee cap after September 26, 2019, the effective date of its rules. To the extent franchise agreements conflict with the FCC's rules, the agency encourages the parties to negotiate franchise modifications within a \"reasonable timeframe,\" which it states should be120 days in most cases. Under the new regulations: The FCC oversees state franchising authorities for the first time. Cable-related in-kind contributions from both new entrants and incumbent cable operators are \"franchise fees\" subject to the 5% cap, with limited exceptions. Such contributions include any nonmonetary contributions related to the provision of video services by incumbent cable operators and LECs as a condition or requirement of a local franchise agreement. Examples include free and discounted cable video service to public buildings; costs in support of PEG access facilities other than capital costs; and costs associated with the construction, maintenance, and service of an I-Net. For purposes of calculating contributions toward the 5% franchise fee cap, video providers and LFAs must attach a fair market value to cable-related in-kind contributions, but the FCC declined to provide guidance on how to calculate fair market value. The definition of PEG \"capital costs\" subject to the 5% cap includes equipment purchases and construction costs, but does not include the cost of installing the facilities that LFAs use to deliver PEG services from locations where the programming is produced to the cable headend. Requirements that cable operators build out their systems within the franchise area and the cost of providing channel capacity for PEG channels may not be included under the 5% cap. Franchise authorities may not regulate nonvideo services offered over cable systems by incumbent cable operators. The services covered by this prohibition include broadband internet service, business data services, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. \"[S]tates, localities, and cable franchising authorities are preempted from charging franchised cable operators more than five percent of their gross revenue from cable [video] services.\" Thus, LFAs may not include nonvideo service revenues when calculating the 5% cap. The communities of Los Angeles, CA, Portland, OR, and Eugene, OR, have filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit challenging the FCC's rules. The Ninth Circuit has consolidated the various appellate court challenges, and in November 2019, granted an FCC motion to transfer the now-consolidated petition to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit. Table 1 , as well as the following two tables, illustrate how the FCC's rules could potentially affect the franchising process in several states. The FCC's decision to extend its franchising rule to state governments for the first time will subject each of the states listed in the first three columns of Table 1 (i.e., those that issue franchises at the state-level in all or some circumstances) to the FCC's rules. Moreover, the FCC's rules will cover states that oversee municipal franchises via either statute or state-level agencies. Thus, the FCC's franchising rules will affect more video service providers, viewers, and municipal governments than ever before. Because the FCC is including cable-related in-kind contributions in its definition of franchise fees subject to the 5% cap, some states and municipalities may need to make a trade-off. Specifically, as Table 2 illustrates, several states require or allow LFAs to require video service providers to offer free and/or discounted video service to public buildings, support of PEG services (other than capital costs), and support of I-Nets. Affected states and municipalities may need to reevaluate the trade-off between in-kind cable-related contributions and general fund revenues. Note that Ohio and Wisconsin prohibit both PEG and I-Net contribution requirements, while Idaho prohibits I-Net contribution requirements. As Table 3 illustrates, some states define \"gross revenues\" more narrowly than the FCC, excluding, for example , revenues from advertising and home shopping commissions. In those states, as well as others in which municipal LFAs define gross revenues more narrowly than the FCC, PEGs may be able to continue to receive cable-related, in-kind contributions without reducing the monetary contributions they receive, while remaining within the 5% cap. As described in \" Franchise Fees and PEGs ,\" the FCC has included revenues from advertising and home shopping commissions, in addition to revenues from video service subscriptions, in its definition of \"gross revenues.\" LFAs that use similar definitions of \"gross revenues,\" including those subject to state regulation, may already charge the maximum amount of franchise fees permitted by the FCC. Others, however, exclude these sources, and may therefore have more flexibility when evaluating whether or not to continue their cable-related in-kind contributions. Moreover, some states specifically exclude other items when calculating providers' revenue bases that are subject to the franchise fees. Several exclude government fees and/or taxes passed on to subscribers, while Missouri excludes fees and contributions for I-Nets and PEG support from its calculation. The FCC has not specifically addressed whether franchise authorities may include these items in their revenue base calculation. Thus, these states may also have more flexibility when evaluating whether to change video franchises' terms and conditions. Many states already exclude nonvideo revenues from the calculation of provider revenues subject to the franchise fee cap. New York, however, describes the gross revenues of a video provider subject to the franchising fees as including, among other things, \"carrier service revenue.\" This section of the New York statute does not define \"carrier service revenue.\" A current dispute between New York City and Charter Communications (d/b/a Spectrum) for service within Brooklyn concerns whether \"carrier service revenue\" received from \"additional provided services\" may be subject to franchise fees. The FCC's new rules may affect the outcome of this dispute. Moreover, in July 2019, the New York State Public Service Commission approved a settlement of a complaint that Charter has failed to comply with a requirement in its franchise agreement to expand high-speed service. Under the settlement, Charter may continue operating within the state, if it expands its high-speed internet service infrastructure to 145,000 residents in Upstate New York and invests $12 million in providing high-speed internet services to other areas of the state. If Charter contends that the FCC's rules preempt these provisions, it could seek to renegotiate the settlement. The FCC cited a decision by the Supreme Court of Oregon in City of Eugene v. Comcast as an example of states and localities asserting authority to impose fees and requirements beyond their authority. In the decision, the court upheld a local government's 7% license fee on revenue from broadband services provided over a franchised cable system. Thus, while states and municipalities may regulate both video and voice services of telcos, they may only regulate video services of cable operators. If a state or municipality may charge franchise fees to cable operators and telcos only with respect to video services, the total amount of fees received is likely to decrease over time. As Figure 1 indicates, the total number of U.S. households subscribing to cable and telco video services has declined over the past 10 years. In 2010, about 70.8 million households subscribed to either a cable operator or a telco, compared with about 60.1 million households in 2019. In place of cable, more households have elected to rely on video provided over broadband connections or broadcast transmission. For cable operators in particular, this substitution of alternative sources of programming has led to the pursuit of revenue from nonvideo services, such as voice and high-speed data. In 2010, video services represented about 63% of total cable industry revenue, whereas in 2019 video represented 46% of total industry revenue ( Figure 2 ). Pursuant to the FCC's proposed rules, these other sources of revenue are not subject to LFAs' jurisdiction. In addition, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that a cable operator's voice services are not a telecommunications service, and therefore not subject to state regulation. In October 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the Minnesota Public Utility Commission's petition hear the case. In Missouri, the City of Creve Coeur and other municipalities filed a class action lawsuit against satellite operators DIRECTV, DISH Network, as well as online streaming services Netflix Inc., and Hulu LLC, claiming that the companies must pay a percentage of gross receipts from video services to the municipalities where they do business, pursuant to Missouri's Video Services Providers Act. The state law allows Missouri's political subdivisions to collect up to 5% of gross receipts from providers of video programming and requires providers to register before providing service in the state, according to court documents. The municipalities claim the defendants have not paid the required amounts. Other localities may follow suit. A bill before the Illinois General Assembly would impose a 5% tax (rather than a \"franchise fee\") on the video service revenues of direct broadcast satellite operators and online video services for the right to provide services to Illinois residents. Similarly, a bill before the Massachusetts House of Representatives would impose a 5% fee on revenues earned by streaming video services. Massachusetts would split the money collected from the fees between the state's general fund (20%), municipalities (40%), and PEG programmers (40%). If receipts from cable franchise fees continue to erode, more states and municipalities may respond by seeking alternative revenue sources. In 2014, Congress enacted the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization Act (STELA Reauthorization Act; P.L. 113-200 ). Section 111 of the act directed the FCC to develop a streamlined process for the filing of \"effective competition\" petitions by small cable operators within 180 days of the law's enactment. A cable company filing such a petition bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that it faces effective competition for its video services. The FCC responded in 2015 by adopting a rebuttable presumption that cable operators are subject to effective competition. As a result, the FCC prohibited franchising authorities from regulating basic cable rates unless they can demonstrate that the cable system is not subject to effective competition. The FCC stated that the change in its effective competition definition was justified by the fact that direct broadcast satellite service was available as an alternative video services provider throughout the United States. Later in 2015, the FCC found that LFAs in two states, Massachusetts and Hawaii, demonstrated that cable systems in their geographic areas were not subject to effective competition, and permitted them to continue to regulate the rates of the basic tiers of cable services. However, in September 2018, Charter Communications (Charter), a cable provider, asked the FCC to find that AT&T's DIRECTV NOW, a streaming service that AT&T has since rebranded as AT&T TV NOW, provides effective competition to cable systems in Kauai, HI, and 32 Massachusetts communities. In October 2019, the FCC agreed and issued an order granting Charter's petition, finding for the first time that an online streaming service affiliated with a LEC meets the LEC test in Congress's definition of effective competition. The FCC found that [AT&T TV NOW] need not itself be a LEC and AT&T need not offer telephone exchange service in the franchise areas.... There is no requirement ... that a LEC provide telephone exchange service in the same communities as the competing video programming service. Thus, if even AT&T TV NOW's subscribers rely on internet service from Charter to receive AT&T TV NOW's programming, the FCC considers AT&T TV NOW to be a competitor to Charter with respect to the distribution of video programming. According to the FCC, Congress adopted the LEC test because LECs and their affiliates \"are uniquely well-funded and well-established entities that would provide durable competition to cable,\" and not because [Congress was] focused on facilities-based competition. Meanwhile, some localities have enacted legislation with the goal of reducing prices consumers pay for video services. A 2019 Maine law would require video service providers to offer networks and programs on an a la carte basis instead of offering subscribers only bundles of channels. Several cable operators, broadcasters, and content providers have sued to overturn the law. In January 2020, a federal judge blocked the implementation of the law as the parties prepare for trial. These regulatory developments and industry trends raise several potential issues for Congress to consider. First, Congress could consider whether the FCC's interpretation of the Communications Act is consistent with the policy goals set forth in Section 601 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7521) and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act. Specifically, Congress could explore the extent, if any, to which state and local regulations designed to promote the availability of PEG programming and I-Nets. Second, Congress could evaluate whether to create regulatory parity with respect to local regulation of nonvideo services of cable and telcos. While states and municipalities may regulate both video and voice services of telcos, they may only regulate video services of cable operators. Congress could address regulatory parity by either deregulating traditional telcos' nonvideo services or regulating cable operators' nonvideo services. Third, as the FCC and local governments include online video providers in their definitions of video providers for the purposes of evaluating competition and/or imposing franchise fees, Congress could clarify whether these actions achieve its stated policy goals. For example, if, in contrast to the FCC's interpretation of the LEC test for effective competition, Congress intends to include only facilities-based video services in its definition of video service competition, it could delineate the definition in communications laws. Likewise, as online video services become more prevalent and states and municipalities target them for franchise fees, Congress could specify the authority, if any, to regulate them. Finally, while the FCC has determined that competition among video programming distribution services has eliminated the need for rate regulation of the basic tier of cable services, Maine enacted a law to enable consumers to pay only for video programming they choose, in lieu of bundles of channels. In the past, some Members of Congress have proposed statutory changes to require video programming distributors to offer individual channels to consumers in addition to bundles of channels, and Congress could consider revisiting this issue, or alternatively clarifying that states and local governments lack authority to enact such laws.",
      "summary": "Local and state governments have traditionally played an important role in regulating cable television operators, within limits established by federal law. In a series of rulings since 2007, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has further limited the ability of local governments (known as local franchise authorities ) to regulate and collect fees from cable television companies and traditional telephone companies (known as telcos ) offering video services. In August 2019, in response to a ruling by a federal court of appeals, the FCC tightened restrictions on municipalities' and\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the first time\u00e2\u0080\u0094on states' ability to regulate video service providers. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, still allows local governments to require video service operators to provide public, educational, and government (PEG) channels to their subscribers. The FCC's August 2019 order, however, sets new limits on local governments' ability to collect fees from operators to support the channels. In addition, the FCC ruled that local franchise authorities could not regulate nonvideo services offered by incumbent cable operators, such as broadband internet service, business data services, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. In October 2019, also for the first time, the FCC concluded that a video streaming service was providing \"effective competition\" to certain local cable systems, thereby preempting the affected municipalities' ability to regulate local rates for basic cable service. These rulings have caused controversy. The FCC has asserted that they fulfill a statutory mandate to promote private-sector investment in advanced telecommunications and information services and to limit government regulation when competition exists. State and local governments, however, have objected that the regulatory changes deprive them of revenue and make it harder for them to ensure that video providers meet local needs. Against this backdrop of federal government actions limiting cable service regulation at the local level, consumer behavior continues to change. Specifically, an increasing number of consumers are substituting streaming services for video services provided by cable companies and telcos. As a result, the amount of revenue state and local governments receive from cable and telco providers subject to franchise fees is declining, which also reduces the amount cable providers can be required to spend to support PEG channels. In response, some municipalities and states have attempted to impose fees on online video services, such as Netflix and Hulu. Courts have not yet ruled on the legality of such fees. These regulatory developments and industry trends raise several potential issues for Congress. First, Congress could consider whether the FCC's interpretation of the Communications Act with respect to local regulation of video service providers is consistent with Congress's policy goals. Specifically, Congress could explore the extent, if any, to which, if any, it encourages or permits state and local regulations designed to promote the availability of PEG programming as well as subsidized voice, data, and video services for municipal institutions. Second, Congress could evaluate whether to create regulatory parity with respect to local regulation of cable and telcos' nonvideo services. While states and municipalities may regulate both video and voice services of telcos, they may only regulate video services of cable operators. Congress could address regulatory parity by either deregulating traditional telcos' nonvideo services or regulating cable operators' nonvideo services. Third, as the FCC and local governments include online video streaming services in their definitions of video providers for the purposes of evaluating competition and/or imposing franchise fees, Congress could clarify whether these actions achieve its stated policy goals. Finally, given the FCC's actions to reduce local government rate regulation of cable services and the State of Maine's legislation to enable video subscribers to seek alternatives to bundled programming, Members of Congress could reconsider past proposed statutory changes to require video programming distributors to offer individual channels to consumers. Alternatively, Congress could clarify that states and local governments lack authority to enact such laws.",

      "document": "Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wants to put tackling corruption at the \"top of the international agenda\" ahead of a London summit on the issue.\n\nThe international anti-corruption summit - the first of its kind - is aimed at exposing, punishing and drive out global corruption.\n\nPolitical leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at Lancaster House on Thursday.\n\nMr Cameron says corruption is \"the root of so many of the world's problems\".\n\nHe also described it as \"an enemy of progress\".\n\n\"It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,\" he added.\n\n\"The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.\n\n\"For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.\"\n\nAmong the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg.\n\nRussia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov.\n\nPanellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde.\n\nUnder the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it.\n\nCampaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit.\"\n\nRobert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: \"The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.\n\n\"What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions\".",

Bentley engineers have bumped the output of the Continental GT V8 S\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twin-turbo 4-litre V8 from 521 horsepower to a healthy 572hp and, starting with the rear seats, stripped out more than 200lbs of nonessentials. (Admittedly, the car still tips the scales at a beefy 4,839lbs.) Lowered gearing makes this racy Conti quicker off the line (zero to 60mph in 3.6 seconds, compared to 4.3sec for the V8 S coupe) but a tad slower (a top speed of 170mph, compared with the V8 S coupe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 192mph). Bentley has yet to announce pricing but, with production limited to a scant 300 cars (all of which will be white), it is safe enough to expect a six-figure upgrade from the standard V8 S coupe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $199,225 starting figure.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the ability of the United States to deliver more \n        effective educational services to citizens, especially \n        disadvantaged citizens, is of primary importance to the \n        national and economic security of the United States;\n            (2) fundamental reform is needed in our Nation's \n        educational system in order to release the creative energies of \n        teachers, students, parents, and communities;\n            (3) market forces of competition and choice can have a \n        positive influence in promoting fundamental reform; however, \n        choice is incomplete without the availability of more \n        educational choices for all students, including disadvantaged \n        students and historically underserved students;\n            (4) the exclusive franchise that local educational agencies \n        have traditionally had on the creation of new public schools \n        has served to limit the number and variety of school choices \n        available to parents and students; and\n            (5) public education should be defined by outcomes and \n        requirements that protect and promote the public interest, not \n        solely by the ownership or control of facilities and programs \n        by a local educational agency or other public agency.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) encourage States to offer teachers, parents, and local \n        communities the opportunity to establish new and more effective \n        public schools;\n            (2) provide Federal assistance and flexibility to encourage \n        States to assist teachers, parents, and communities to develop \n        such schools; and\n            (3) provide criteria for States, teachers, parents, and \n        communities to use in establishing new and more effective \n        public schools.\n\nSEC. 4.

      "document": "since dental ceramic restorations have been introduced in 20 century,1 reproduction of natural appearance of teeth has been a major concern in dentistry . for metal - ceramic restorations , \n light reflection from an opaque porcelain layer to mask the metal substrate resulted in opaque appearance and therefore , their use in high esthetic area was limited.2 glass ceramic restorations without metal substrate induced more light transmission and accordingly , they improved the ability to reproduce the appearance of tooth structure.3 despite the esthetic advantage of glass ceramics , the demands for stronger ceramic restorations have increased . as a result \n , high strength zirconia - based ceramics combined with cad / cam technology have broadened the range of their applications in dentistry.4 however , cohesive failure of the veneering porcelain has been reported as a major drawback56 and thereby , fabricating monolithic zirconia restoration which consists of a single zirconia material without any veneering could be an alternative approach to obviate the veneering failure.7 the esthetic value of dental ceramic restorations is influenced by several factors , such as color , translucency , fluorescence , surface texture and shape.8 furthermore , the overall color of ceramic restorations can be influenced by the thickness of the ceramic , the thickness and the color of luting agent , and the color of the underlying tooth structure . \n 9 several studies investigated the effect of the thickness on overall color and translucency of ceramic restorations.291011121314 changes of color and translucency may be expected when the thickness of porcelain layer changes , although the direction of color change may depend on the specific components of the ceramic systems.15 due to its inherent white and opaque appearance , monolithic zirconia can be colored in a pre - sintered state to match adjacent teeth . in a clinical situation , there could be a thickness reduction during the process of occlusal adjustment by dentists . \n however , there have been no reported studies regarding the changes of color and translucency as a function of changes in thickness using monolithic zirconia . \n the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the amount of thickness reduction on color and translucency of dental monolithic zirconia ceramics . \n the null hypothesis to be tested was that there was no significant difference in color and translucency between monolithic zirconia ceramics with different amount of thickness reduction . \n one - hundred sixty - five square - shaped specimens from presintered yttria - stabilized tetragonal zirconia blocks ( lot no . : b 105566 , b 105583 , b 105565 , b 88712 ; bruxzir , glidewell laboratories , newport beach , ca , usa ) were colored with coloring liquid ( lot no . : 40127 , 40129 ; tanaka zircolor , a2 , tanaka dental , skokie , il , usa ) and assigned to 5 groups according to the number of coloring liquid application ( group i ( one time ) to v ( five times ) , n = 33 per each group ) following the same protocol used in our previous study.7 the specimens were heated in a furnace ( austromat basic , dekema dental - keramikfen gmbh , freilassing , germany ) with a step sintering procedure ; sintering at 950 for 10 minutes and at 1,500 for 2 hours . \n after sintering , the thickness adjustment was performed in the same manner as was used in our previous studies.716 accordingly , the final dimensions of the specimens were 16.3 mm  16.3 mm  2.0 mm . \n each group was then divided into eleven subgroups ( n = 3 per each subgroup ) by reducing the thickness of 0.1 to 1.0 mm in increments of 0.1-mm on the colored surface using a horizontal grinding machine ( hrg-150 , am technology , asan , korea ) ; subgroup 0 ( no reduction ) , subgroup 1 ( 0.1 mm reduction ) to subgroup 10 ( 1.0 mm reduction ) . \n color parameters were obtained from cie - lab ( commission internationale de l'eclairage l , a , b ) color space relative to d65 on a reflection spectrophotometer ( cm-3500d , konica minolta , tokyo , japan ) . for the instrument , \n diffuse illumination was used and the reflected light was measured ( cie diffuse/8-degree ) at the center and each quarter of the specimen . a 3-mm diameter aperture for diffuse illumination and 3-mm measurement area \n each of l , a and b values was measured against a black background ( cm - a 101b , konica minolta , tokyo , japan , l = 0.1099 , a = 0.2107 , and b = -0.4292 ) and a white background ( cm - a120 , konica minolta , tokyo , japan , l = 96.6880 , a = -0.1755 , and b = -0.1236 ) in the reflectance mode with specular component excluded ( sce ) at 10 nm intervals in the wavelength range of visible light , 400 - 700 nm . \n optical contact was obtained by placing a drop of distilled water ( refractive index : 1.33 , approximately ) between each specimen and a background.11 spectral reflectance against a white background was recorded at 10 nm intervals in the range of 400 to 700 nm . color difference between each subgroup was calculated using cie lab color - difference formula17 denoted by eab = [ ( l ) + ( a ) + ( b ) ] . \n l , a , and b refer to the difference on lightness , red / green axis , and yellow / blue axis , respectively . to determine the color difference , the average cie values against a black background were used . for translucency measurements , translucency parameter \n tp value was calculated by the color difference between values against a black and a white background18 which is denoted by tp = [ ( lb - lw ) + ( ab - aw ) + ( bb - bw ) ] . \n diffuse transmittance measurement was performed using an integrating sphere with the aperture size of 9.5 mm in diameter . \n all measurements , therefore , were made at the center and each quarter of the specimen and values were averaged . \n , chicago , il , usa ) and the  level was set at 0.05 . \n normal distribution of each color value and tp value was verified with shapiro - wilk test . to identify \n if there is any significant difference in color and tp values among subgroups , one - way anova was carried out followed by multiple comparison scheff test . \n pearson correlation and linear regression was fitted to test for a relationship between the amount of thickness reduction and color and tp values . \n 3 showed means of cie l , a and b values of each group against a black background in the reflectance mode as a function of the amount of thickness reduction , respectively . \n cie a value generally increased , while cie b value decreased with the increase of thickness reduction in all groups . \n correlation analyses between l , a or b values against a black background in the reflectance mode and the amount of thickness reduction were conducted . \n there were negative , but weak correlations between l value and the amount of thickness reduction in most groups ( -0.58 < r < 0.34 , 0.09 < r < 0.34 ) . \n there were positive correlations between a value and the amount of thickness reduction in all groups ( 0.72 < r < 0.85 , 0.52 < r < 0.73 ) . \n there were negative correlations between b value and the amount of thickness reduction in all groups ( -0.86 < r < -0.07 , 0.00 < r < 0.74 ) . \n average spectral reflectance curves against a white background of each subgroup within groups were obtained ( fig . \n 4 ) . there was a significant difference between subgroup 0 and other subgroups through the entire spectrum and the values of spectral reflectance in other subgroups were lower than subgroup 0 . \n the interpretation of the color difference for this study is based on the visual matching study of johnston and kao19 who found that color difference of 3.7 eab unit was acceptable for resin composites . \n color differences between subgroup 0 and other subgroups were clinically perceptible ( eab > 3.7 ) ( fig . 5 ) \n color differences between subgroup 1 and 2 were within the range of perceptibility threshold ( eab < 3.7 ) except group ii . \n color differences between subgroup 2 and 3 were within the range of perceptibility threshold except group v. color differences between subgroup 3 and 4 , 4 and 5 , 5 and 6 , 6 and 7 , 7 and 8 , 8 and 9 , 9 and 10 were within the range of perceptibility threshold in all groups . \n means of tp for each subgroup within groups are calculated and ranged from 2.27 to 5.34 ( table 1 ) . \n highly significant correlations were found out between tp values and the amount of thickness reduction in all groups ( r > 0.94 , r > 0.89 , p < .001 ) . \n spectral transmittance of each subgroup exhibited similar spectral behavior through the entire spectrum and transmittance generally increased with increasing the amount of thickness reduction in all groups ( fig . \n according to the results of this in vitro study , the null hypothesis could be rejected because there were significant differences in l , a or b values and tp values between monolithic zirconia specimens with different amount of thickness reduction . \n the effect of various changes in thickness of each layer on the final appearance of layered metal - ceramic structures has been studied.212152021 l value substantially increased with the decrease of porcelain thickness212 and the direction of color changes were dependent on porcelain shade and the type of metal - ceramic alloy . \n increasing the thickness of dentin porcelain produced more scattering and absorption of the incident light and less light reflected back from the opaque layer . \n with regard to all - ceramic systems , l value generally decreased due to increased absorption of incident light with thicker specimens , while a and b values increased as the ceramic thickness increased.101113 there might be a difference in the amount of light reflection at the opaque core between all - ceramic systems with different core translucency . \n douglas and przybylska2 demonstrated that the semi - translucent all - ceramic systems were less affected by reduced porcelain thicknesses compared to metal - ceramics . in this study , \n the changes in l value showed a different feature compared to metal - ceramic or all - ceramic systems . \n there was a significant decrease in l value at initial reduction , but there were no further significant changes on l value in most groups ( fig . \n 1 ) . the different aspect of change might come from different optical and structural properties since monolithic zirconia ceramic is polycrystalline monolayer without any veneering . \n it can be inferred that there might be reduced scattering due to the reduced thickness which induces lower l value at first 0.1 mm reduction . however , as the thickness reduction proceeds , monolithic zirconia itself could act as an opaque core and induce internal reflection.22 thus , reduced reflection might compensate increased internal reflection and l value could be relatively stable . \n chromatically , a value increased , while b value generally decreased with increasing thickness reduction . regarding the shift in chroma , \n b value was more sensitive to the change of thickness than a value showing minimal shifts in a value . \n 21113 according to the study of douglas and brewer,23 dental observers were more sensitive and critical to the color difference in redness than yellowness for metal - ceramic crowns . \n however , their study was conducted with metalceramic crowns and therefore , further study should be performed to determine whether there is any difference in subjective color assessment between a and b value for monolithic zirconia restorations . \n 3 ) , group ii exhibited noticeable changes in a and b values down to 0.2 mm reduction and group iii ; to 0.3 mm reduction , group iv ; to 0.6 mm reduction , and group v ; to 0.5 mm reduction . \n there was no distinct difference in a and b values between groups after around 0.6 mm reduction . \n it can be inferred that the more coloring liquid is applied , the deeper the coloring liquid infiltrates . \n in addition , one time of coloring liquid application might infiltrate 0.1 mm deep through monolithic zirconia specimen , two times of application ; 0.2 mm deep , three times of application ; 0.3 mm deep , and four or five times of application ; around 0.6 mm deep through monolithic zirconia specimen . \n this study exhibited a perceptible color difference from no reduction ( eab > 3.7 ) even after first 0.1 mm reduction regardless of the number of coloring liquid applications . \n antonson and anusavice14 investigated the translucency of dental core and veneering ceramics as a function of ceramic thickness . \n there was a positive linear correlation between contrast ratio and thickness ( r > 0.81 ) . \n hefffernan et al . investigated the effect of the thickness of core materials,24 and the thickness of veneered core materials25 on the translucency of the specimens . \n o'keefe et al.26 suggested that the thickness of the porcelain veneer was the primary factor affecting light transmission and not the opacity . \n tp values generally increased as the amount of thickness reduction increased in all groups ( r > 0.89 , p < .001 ) . based on lambert 's law,27 decreasing the thickness of material \n the fraction of incident light that is reflected , absorbed , and transmitted depends upon the thickness of the specimen as well as the scattering and absorption characteristics.28 this in vitro study has several potential limitations . \n the first limitation is that even application of coloring liquid on the specimens and exact amount of the increase of coloring liquid were difficult to control . \n secondly , possible pressure fluctuation inside the furnace during the sintering process might have induced uneven color of the specimens . \n thirdly , the aperture diameter of spectrophotometer for reflectance measurement was 3 mm and possible edge loss would have affected the color measurement . \n finally , this study was conducted with limited color of shade a2 and with a specific kind of monolithic zirconia system and coloring liquid . \n therefore , the influence of varied color combinations with different monolithic zirconia systems should be further studied . \n increasing thickness reduction reduces lightness and increases a reddish , bluish appearance , and translucency of monolithic zirconia ceramics .",

      "document": "stress urinary incontinence ( sui ) is defined as the complaint of involuntary leakage on effort or exertion or on sneezing or coughing . although sui is not a life - threatening condition \n surgical therapy is employed in patients who have severe degrees of sui or those patients in whom conservative or pharmacological treatments have failed . \n sling procedures for genuine sui are today the mainstay of treatment and have been used for over a century with first procedure reported by schultze in 1888 . \n the integral theory of female urinary continence described by petros and ulmsten redefined the modern approach to anti - incontinence surgery and ushered the era of the midurethral sling . \n the concept was applied clinically by placing the sling to a more distal location beneath the urethra then as compared to the previous techniques . \n subsequently excellent results were presented using suprapubic arc system ( sparc , american medical systems inc . \n some authors have even termed midurethral sling surgery as the new gold - standard for sui . with the available midurethral slings , the trocar has to be passed blindly either from above ( suprapubically ) or below ( transvaginally ) , which increases the chances of injury to the pelvic organs and blood vessels . \n shlomo raz modified the technique of sling placement with opening the endopelvic fascia and passing the needle under controlled digital palpation , thereby decreasing the chances of injury to surrounding pelvic organs as well as significantly decreasing cost using tailor - made mesh . \n their finger - guided passing of needle was similar to the raz procedure of bladder neck suspension . \n we present our experience with the use of large pore polypropylene mesh / polypropylene - polyglactin mesh as a pubovaginal sling ( midurethral ) in the treatment of sui with the modified raz technique . \n a retrospective analysis was performed of consecutive 53 patients of pure sui who underwent midurethral slings procedure with the modified technique from june 2003 to december 2008 at our institute . \n preoperative evaluation included a history , physical examination , urine microscopic examination , and culture . \n severity of sui was defined by the number of pads used by the patients per day as mild ( < 2 ) , moderate ( 24 ) , and severe ( > 4 ) . \n patients were examined in lithotomy and standing positions to demonstrate sui on cough test and valsalva maneuver . \n four patients of our series underwent multichannel urodynamic examination for history suggestive of mixed incontinence in accordance with nice guidelines . \n all patients were counseled regarding the need of postoperative clean intermittent catheterization ( cic ) and transient voiding dysfunction . \n vaginal tissue was atrophic in four patients and they were preoperatively treated with local estrogen cream . \n twenty patients gave previous history of hysterectomy ; others had history of undergoing gynecological procedures , details of which were not available . \n none of the patients had previous history of surgery for incontinence or pelvic organ prolapsed . \n eight patients had grade 1 cystocele and two patients had grade 1 rectocele , which did not require treatment . \n five patients underwent simultaneous vaginal hysterectomy for gynecological indications . a polypropylene mesh ( prolene ) \n /polypropylene - polyglactin mesh ( vipro ) measuring 1  10 cm ( ethicon , johnson and johnson , usa ) was fashioned from commercially available 15  7.5 cm mesh . \n this strip was soaked in antibiotic saline and stitched at all four corners to 1 - 0 polyglactin suture . \n 16 fr foley catheter was placed in urinary bladder and balloon was palpated at bladder neck to estimate urethral length . \n two percent of xylocaine with adrenaline was infiltrated in the vaginal mucosa overlying the urethra . \n a 1.52 cm mid - line incision was made over the midurethra ( 1.5 cm proximal to external urethral meatus ) . \n vaginal mucosal flaps were dissected on either side extending into avascular plane , until endopelvic fascia was reached . \n blunt dissection was carried out in retropubic space by inserting a finger and the bladder was swept medially . \n two small punctures were made suprapubically and a double - pronged needle ( cook urological inc . , \n indiana , usa ) is passed under finger control through the fascia and retropubic space . \n a marking catgut suture is placed in the center of the mesh along its length to ensure that mesh placement is equidistant . \n the polyglactin suture was pulled and tension adjusted by placing the tip of an artery forceps while positioning sling against midurethra . \n vaginal pack was removed after 24 hours of surgery and providine - iodine vaginal pressary was advised for 5 days . \n if residual urine was more than 50 ml , patient was advised cic . in sexually active patients , \n the patients were followed up with history and clinical examination by the operating surgeon in the opd . \n social dryness was defined as patient requiring 1 pad per day and acceptable leak while carrying out routine tasks . \n five of the patients also underwent simultaneous vaginal hysterectomy for gynecological indications with no increase in morbidity . \n mean duration of follow - up was 46.1 months ( 1278 months ) [ table 1 ] . \n forty - five ( 85% ) patients were completely dry and eight ( 15% ) were socially dry at the end of the follow - up . \n four patients failed voiding trial and were advised cic , which was later discontinued after 38 weeks , when their pvr fell to < 50 ml . \n two patients complained of dull aching lower abdominal pain , which was relieved by administration of oral analgesic agents . \n five of our patients complained of mild dyspareunia , which was transient and did not require treatment [ table 2 ] . \n none of the patients reported significant voiding dysfunction , infection , nonhealing , or erosion of the sling till their last follow - up [ table 2 ] . \n over last few years , many procedures using autologous material ( rectus sheath , fascia lata ) or synthetic material ( polypropylene , mersilene ) have been reported in literature \n . continued refinements in materials were sought to identify an ideal compound for use in transvaginal slings that would be inert , sterile , noncarcinogenic , and mechanically durable . \n synthetic materials have the advantage of being readily available and do not require harvesting from another site . \n this decreases the operative time , discomfort , and potential donor site complications after the surgery . \n histological and clinical studies have shown that polypropylene is a synthetic material that is well - tolerated by the body , with little exposure of the patient to infection and vaginal or urethral erosion . \n cure rates using synthetic slings have been shown to be around 7395% . in a review of contemporary literature , \n daneshgari et al . have found complication rates ranging from 4.3% to 75.1% for retropubic midurethral slings . \n they have quoted postoperative obstruction ranging from 1.9% to 19.7% from various series . in these patients , \n resolution is commonly spontaneous ; the intervening period can be managed with cic or indwelling catheter . \n a recent meta - analysis showed that tvt outperformed burch colposuspension both in terms of postoperative continence rates , whereas success rate efficacies were similar after tvt and pubovaginal slings . comparing tvt to the other retropubic tension - free midurethral vaginal slings , tvt was more efficacious than both intravaginal slingplasty ( ivs ) and sparc . \n some authors have even described midurethral slings as the new gold - standard for the treatment of female sui . \n the reasons for popularity of these procedures are effectiveness , ease , and low rate of serious complications . \n a recent meta - analysis of complications of these procedures have highlighted significantly high rates of bladder perforation after tvt . \n have questioned the authenticity of reported complication rates and have described major complications and even 10 deaths as retrieved after systemic search of food and drug administration ( fda ) manufacturer and user facility device experience ( maude ) database . \n rodriguez and raz have described a mid - distal urethral sling procedure in which distal urethra is defined as anything distal to the pubourethral ligament . \n they have explained the mechanism of action of tvt procedure by providing support as well as contributing to normal function of distal urethral complex ( composed of the pubourethral ligaments , intrinsic sphincteric mechanism , extrinsic sphincter , and levator muscles located immediately distal to the pubourethral ligaments ) . \n furthermore , they have enumerated the drawbacks of current midurethral sling systems as being blind procedures with consequently higher incidences of major complications . in their modification \n , a sling is refashioned from commercially available mesh , which is cheap , does not require any special instrumentation , and is placed only within the retropubic space . \n the optimal surgical approach should minimize the risk of damage to the bladder neck , vagina , and urethra . \n this is achieved by developing retropubic space with blunt dissection and passing double - pronged needle under finger guidance . \n the procedure should augment the urethral resistance during sudden increase in the intra - abdominal pressure without preventing normal decreases in urethral pressure during voiding . placing a sling beneath \n the urethra increases the urethral compression and provides a plate for receiving the transmitted intra - abdominal pressure to the bladder neck and proximal urethra . \n the safety of the procedure has also been demonstrated in their series with no incidence of major complications . \n conventional guidelines recommended multichannel urodynamic studies in sui patients planned for surgery . with the advent of midurethral slings , which have shown to be effective in all types of urinary incontinence , studies have questioned the routine use of urodynamic parameters like valsalva leak point pressure in predicting outcome of sling surgery . \n have proposed that standard use of urodynamic investigation in the preoperative workup of midurethral slings needs to be revisited . in our series \n we had cure rate in all the 53 patients till their last follow - up . \n sling procedures that are successful at 6 months are likely to remain successful for many years . in our series , all the patients had a follow - up of more than 12 months and all these patients were doing well till their last follow - up . in a comprehensive meta - analysis of complications of midurethral slings , novara et al . \n have found the incidences of various complications  bladder / vaginal perforation 2.919.31% ; hematoma 1.453.9% , uti 3.77.5% , and cic in 77.5% of cases in various rcts and non - randomized studies . \n rodriguez et al . have described pelvic hematoma ( not requiring treatment ) in 0.33% and suprapubic pain in 0.66% of cases . \n three of their patients required cic for maximum of 3 months after which they were all spontaneously voiding . in our series , four ( 7.5% ) \n patients required cic after failed voiding trial , which was discontinued after a period of 38 weeks . \n we attribute this to be the procedure - related local tissue edema / pain , which gradually subsided . \n other minor complications in our series were hematoma ( not requiring treatment ) in 1.8% , uti in 3.7% , low back pain in 3.7% , and dyspareunia in 9.4% of cases . \n major concerns about the erosion of the sling into the urinary tract have been diminished as a result of meticulous detail in placing the mesh through a small incision and tying the mesh loosely so as to avoid excessive compression and ischemia . \n we did not encounter any incidence of mesh erosion into the urethra in our series of patients . \n we faced none of the major injuries like vascular injury , bowel injury , necrotizing fasciitis , sepsis , or death , a fact emphasized by the shlomo raz group . \n one standard - sized polypropylene mesh costs around inr 1800 and polypropylene - polyglactin ( vipro ) mesh costs around inr 2300 . \n this is economically friendlier as compared to custom - made mesh systems commercially available , ranging from inr 18,000 to 25,000 , especially in developing country like india . the limitations of this study are lack of objective analysis and quantification of sui . \n outcomes were based on patients interview on opd basis by the operating surgeon and not by patient - driven questionnaires , possibly influencing the overall results . despite the limitations of the study \n , we believe this procedure is a cost - effective alternative to other minimally invasive procedures using commercially available kits and with comparable outcomes . \n polypropylene mesh as midurethral slings by modified raz technique is cost - effective , safe , and has acceptable complication rates . \n although our series is a not big enough to draw any formal conclusions , but we can safely infer that the results of this procedure are comparable to other techniques used in patients with pure sui .",

      "document": "water disturbance may occur in hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke patients because of the major role that the central nervous system plays in water homeostasis [ 13 ] . \n post - stroke hypernatremia is generally the consequence of central diabetes insipidus , but it can also take place if the patients do not have free water access , usually as the result of neurological sequels which prevents them from drinking water or even asking for it from their relatives and caretakers . \n hypodipsia secondary to lesions of the thirst center , not accompanied by other serious neurological damage , is a rare cause of post - stroke hypernatremia , but it may cause significant morbidity if not properly diagnosed and managed . \n a 56-year - old caucasian man was admitted to the cardiology ward of our hospital due to lethargy and muscle weakness , attributed to the presence of bradycardia . \n routine admission laboratory tests revealed high plasma sodium levels ( na : 157 meq / l ) , which motivated , on the following day , a request for nephrology evaluation . at nephrology consultation \n his past medical history revealed that 9 years previously he had had a hemorrhagic stroke and needed brain surgery to clamp a ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery and to drain a cerebral hemorrhage . \n a representative figure of patient s cranial computed tomography ( ct ) done at that occasion is presented in figure 1 . \n the stroke resulted in some impairment of the capacity of space location , moderate reduction of the recent and fixation memory and a certain aversion to water . \n new laboratory tests were ordered and confirmed hypernatremia : plasma sodium of 155 meq / l and plasma chloride of 116 meq / l . \n urinalysis : urine - specific gravity of 1026 , no blood or protein and a normal sediment . \n plasma potassium , creatinine and urea were , respectively , 4 meq / l , 1.07 mg / dl and 41 mg / dl . in the 24 h that followed nephrology consultation , the patient passed only 400 ml of urine . \n the diagnosis of possible hypernatremia secondary to post - stroke hypodipsia was then made and supervised water intake of 2 l a day was initiated . \n after this simple measure , there was an increase in diuresis and plasma sodium was reduced to 150 \n meq / l on the third day and to 144 meq / l on the fourth day after admission . \n two weeks after hospital discharge , he had gained 3 kg and referred marked improvement in lethargy and muscle weakness . \n the evolution of the patient s laboratory tests , including the ones collected 2 weeks after hospital discharge , are presented in table 1 . \n evolution of plasma sodium and other laboratory tests after patient s hospital admission cranial ct scan showing diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage ( inferior white arrow ) , frontal left intraparenchymatous hematoma ( superior white arrow ) , intraventricular hemorrhage ( inferior black arrow ) and nodular slightly hyperdense image with peripheral calcifications on anterior communicating artery topography , suggestive of giant aneurysm ( superior black arrow ) . \n hypernatremia is relatively frequent in clinical practice , being common in the elderly and in critically ill patients . in patients with free access to water \n when plasma sodium ( the main determinant of plasma osmolality ) increases , two defense mechanisms are triggered : stimulation of the thirst center and secretion of antidiuretic hormone ( adh ) . \n this combination results in increased water intake and reduction in urinary water loss , leading , thus , to normalization of plasma osmolality . \n this mechanism is highly efficient , keeping plasma osmolality in a narrow range , despite the daily variation of water and sodium intake . in the reported case , \n the patient s mechanism of adh liberation and the urinary concentration were preserved : when faced with significant hypernatremia , the patient s 24-h urine volume was only 400 ml , and the urine had high specific gravity ( 1.026 ) ; normalization of plasma sodium concentration , urine dilution and weight gain occurred when supervised water intake was warranted . \n this case illustrates the fact that even when the mechanisms of adh liberation and urine concentration are intact , and if the thirst mechanism is damaged , the body is not capable of maintaining normonatremia [ 3 , 6 , 7 ] . \n post - stroke hypodipsia may be the result of damage to the hypothalamic thirst center , believed to be present in the lamina terminalis of the third ventricle in the presented case , there was extensive intraventricular hemorrhage  but this may occur even in the absence of ct evidence of hypothalamic damage , possibly due to a cortical central nervous system lesion that interferes with cortical perception of thirst . \n the clinical symptoms that motivated the patient s hospital admission and that were at the first attributed to bradycardia were apparently caused by hypernatremia . \n in fact , this patient had been presenting muscle weakness and lethargy very frequently in his daily life and his wife reported that these symptoms had begun after the stroke . \n indeed , the review of his past laboratory test values revealed that in the course of medical evaluations done in the past , high values of plasma sodium were documented ( 170 meq / l in september 2007 and 151 meq / l in february 2009 ) but were misinterpreted as laboratory artifacts since the patient presented no physical sequels of the hemorrhagic stroke and , as hypernatremia was chronic , significant neurological symptoms were absent . \n sadly , a second measurement of plasma sodium was not ordered on neither of those two occasions . \n the patient s weight loss was secondary to true dehydration since it was quickly corrected after appropriate water intake . \n no medical reason was found for the patient s bradycardia , but when discharged from hospital , his heart rate was 72 b.p.m .",
      "summary": "disorders in water metabolism may occur in stroke patients . when hypernatremia arises in this setting , it is usually secondary to the development of central diabetes insipidus or it is the result of neurologic lesions that prevent patients from having free access to water . \n much rarer are the cases of post - stroke hypernatremia caused by hypodipsia secondary to lesions of the thirst center . \n we report the case of a patient with severe hypernatremia , probably secondary to post - hemorrhagic stroke hypodipsia . \n the hypernatremia seen in this case was corrected by scheduling the patient s water intake .",

The Charger then spun out of control, slamming into a parked vehicle.\n\nAndrew Lutes, a patron at the nearby Bar Reis said the crash was deafening.\n\n\u201cIt was only noticeable because it was going so fast,\u201d Lutes said.\n\nWitnesses said Gonzalez appeared intoxicated as he stumbled out of the Charger, covered in dust from a deployed airbag.\n\nCem Kurtulus claimed the cop tried to hide a white plastic bag he had on him \u2013 something he wanted to keep away from his fellow cops.\n\n\u201cHis jaw was twitching,\u201d Kurtulus said. \u201cHe looked out of his mind, like the most unstable guy on earth.\u201d\n\nCops said that they did not find any drugs at the scene, but they did find two hypodermic needles in Gonzalez\u2019s charger. The officer refused to take a Breathalyzer test when he was taken into custody, officials said.\n\nThe cabbie and two cops from the police cruiser were treated for a smattering of head, neck and back injuries. The cabbie had a deep cut to his forehead that needed stitches, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nAn NYPD spokesman said Gonzalez was off duty at the time of the accident, and has been suspended from duty due to his arrest. The spokesman did not disclose how long Gonzalez had been a police officer.\n\nGonzalez was released on his own recognizance on Tuesday afternoon. Attempts to reach his attorney were unsuccessful.",

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn).\n\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.\n\nJohn Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\".\n\nThe petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.\n\nThe European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

figure 3 ) . \n after 6 months of combination therapy , the cd3 t - cell percentages remained significantly higher than the high activity baseline ( p<0.01 ) . \n the cd3 t - cell percentages across all combination therapy time groups showed no significant differences with the low activity baseline ( p>0.05 ) . \n after 3 months of combination therapy , the cd4 th cell percentage was significantly higher than both the high activity and low activity baselines ( p<0.05 ) . \n after 6 months of combination therapy , the cd4 th cell percentage showed no significant difference with both the high activity and low activity baselines ( p>0.05 ) , but did present a non - significant upward trend . \n after 3 months of combination therapy , the cd8 ts cell percentage showed no significant difference with both the high activity and low activity baselines ( p>0.05 ) . \n after 6 months of combination therapy , the cd8 ts cell percentage was significantly higher than the high activity baseline ( p<0.05 ) . \n after 12 months of combination therapy , the cd8 ts cell percentage was also significantly higher than the low activity baseline ( p<0.05 ) . \n dysfunction in t - cell activation and proliferation plays an important part in sle development through promoting lymphocytic organ infiltration and aiding b - cells in producing auto - antibodies , a process which eventually leads to tissue destruction . \n specifically , changes in the t - cell subset distribution is a hallmark of sle ; for example , mclnerney et al .   showed that 45% of the sle patient population has markedly depressed cd4 th cells levels , and matsushita et al \n .   showed that sle patients have an increase in cd8 ts cell counts accompanied by a decrease in cd4 th cell counts . here \n , we analyzed the t - cell subset distributions of both high and low activity sle patients relative to healthy control individuals at baseline ( prior to vincristine - cyclophosphamide combination therapy ) in order to determine whether t - cell subset distributions vary across different levels of sle disease activity . \n in the high activity group , the percentages of cd3 t - cells and cd4 th cells were significantly lower than healthy controls at baseline ; however , the cd8 ts cell percentage was not significantly different than healthy controls at baseline . \n in contrast , in the low activity group , the cd3 t - cell percentage was not significantly different than healthy controls at baseline , but the cd4 th cell percentage was significantly lower , while the cd8 ts cell percentage was significantly higher , than healthy controls at baseline . \n based on this data , significantly negative correlations were observed between the cd3 + t - cell and cd4 + th cell percentages and sledai score at baseline . \n these combined results indicate that t - cell subset distributions vary across different levels of sle disease activity with higher cd3 t - cell and cd4 th cell percentages favoring lower sle activity . \n a complex regulatory interplay exists between cd8 ts cells and cd4 th cells in sle . \n for example , filaci et al . demonstrated that only cd8 ts cells from sle patients in remission and healthy individuals can function as effective suppressors of cd4 th cells , while cd8 ts cells from active sle patients fail to suppress committed cd4 th cells . \n moreover , cd42h4 th cells  which are suppressor / inducer cd4 th cells that promote cd8 ts cell - based inhibition of b - cells  have been previously shown to have significantly lower proportions in sle patients . based on this previous evidence from sle patients , the lower cd4 \n th cell percentages observed with higher sle activity in the current study may actually indicate lower cd42h4 th cell levels and , in turn , lower cd8 ts cell - based inhibition of b - cells . \n if so , this hypothesis would correctly explain the deficient cd8 ts cytotoxic capacity as well as the b - cell hyperactivity observed in highly active sle [ 1619 ] . in order to test this hypothesis , \n further research should focus on measuring and correlating the levels of cd42h4 th cells , cd8 ts cells , and b - cell autoantibody production as a function of sle activity . \n with respect to vincristine - cyclophosphamide combination therapy , vincristine blocks t - cell mitosis in metaphase , while cyclophosphamide targets rapidly - proliferating t - cells irrespective of cell cycle phase . \n therefore , vincristine and cyclophosphamide can be applied in combination to accomplish a synergistic cytotoxic effect . \n specifically , as vincristine activity begins to decline after a few hours , t - cells that have accumulated in metaphase re - initiate their cell cycle , and cyclophosphamide is then available to kill these t - cells during dna replication [ 2227 ] . here , we found that after the first 3 months of vincristine - cyclophosphamide combination therapy , the cd3 t - cell and cd4 th cell percentages both increased relative to the high activity baseline , which appropriately correlates with reduced sle disease activity as discussed above . \n after 6 months of combination therapy , the cd3 , cd4 , and cd8 t - cell percentages all increased relative to the high activity baseline . \n as cd3 + t - cell and cd4 + th cell percentages negatively correlate with sledai , vincristine - cyclophosphamide combination therapy appears to positively affect t - cell subset distribution to control sle disease activity by increasing their cd3 t - cell and cd4 th cell percentages . \n t - cell subset distributions vary across different levels of sle disease activity with higher cd3 t - cell and cd4 th cell percentages favoring lower sle activity . \n vincristine - cyclophosphamide combination therapy appears to positively affect the t - cell subset distribution in sle patients to keep the disease in remission by increasing their cd3 t - cell and cd4 th cell percentages . \n further studies are needed to examine how the distributions of cd4 th , cd8 ts cells , and other lymphocytes are maintained in sle and to investigate the t - cell - specific cytotoxic mechanisms underlying vincristine - cyclophosphamide combination therapy in sle .",

      "document": "Born in Paris in 1966 to an architect father and pharmacist mother, Fabrice \"Fab\" Morvan was training to be a trampoline athlete until a neck injury forced him to reevaluate his direction. He went with his musician/fisherman grandfather to the Caribbean to hone his musical talents. He moved to Germany at eighteen, where he met future Milli Vanilli partner Rob Pilatus in a Munich nightclub. The two broke and homeless men set out to start a \"rock and soul\" band, and headed to Los Angeles.Within months of their arrival, they were snapped up by Arista Records, and coupled with producer Frank Farian. Little did they know how much harm that meeting would cause. Farian had studio musicians already lined up, and Morvan and Pilatus were literally locked out of the studio during recording sessions. They'd been hired for their look. The first two singles, title track \"Girl You Know it's True\" and \"Blame it on the Rain\", were released in 1988 and 1989 respectively. Their instant fame was exactly what they wanted, but proved too much to bear, and reality hit home when they won Grammy Awards for the two singles. They were quickly exposed as \"frauds,\" and both Farian and Arista Records unfairly claimed ignorance. The two were disgraced and willingly returned their Grammys.They made a comeback attempt in 1993, dropping the name Milli Vanilli for their own names \"Rob and Fab\", this time performing their own music and showcasing their very real musical talents. Despite the utter failure of their return, their millions of fans supported them, knowing that they were the victims in the earlier Milli Vanilli debacle.Following this, Fabrice Morvan continued to perform around Los Angeles as a solo artist, and ultimately held a nine-month stint as the mid-day host on L.A.'s KIIS-FM. On April 5th, 1998, Morvan lost his longtime friend, brother and recording partner Rob Pilatus to an accidental combination of drugs and alcohol. This tragedy served to strengthen Morvan, and today he continues to perform and record, and he's extremely popular on the college lecture circuit.",

      "document": "diaphyseal aclasis , also termed hereditary multiple exostosis ( hme ) or osteochondromatosis is characterised by multiple bony prominences that grow near joint lines throughout the skeleton . \n these bony prominences , otherwise known as exostoses , can present as painless bony deformities or as a complication of the bony growth . \n ( 1 ) there have been approximately 100 cases in the literature of vascular complications due to osteochondromas including pseudoaneurysm formation , occlusion , rupture or thrombosis . \n ( 2 ) this article describes the case of a 15 year old boy , with known hme , referred to the sarcoma mdt with a 9.5 cm diameter mass in the popliteal fossa , confirmed by ultrasound as a delayed presentation of a pseudoaneurysm . \n a 15-year - old boy , with diaphyseal aclasis , presented with a two month history of a painful swelling in his left popliteal fossa , reportedly increasing in size . \n he presented to his local orthopaedic department where repeated radiographs ( figure 1 ) illustrated decreased cortical definition of the exostosis arising from the medial femoral metaphysis 15 cm above the knee joint . \n at this point he was referred to the regional sarcoma mdt due to concern that the lesion had undergone malignant transformation . \n plain radiographs of the patient s left knee on examination , there was a 10 cm , non - tender , pulsatile mass in the popliteal fossa . \n the foot was warm with normal capillary refill , palpable posterior tibialis artery but absent dorsalis pedis . \n the mri scan showed a lesion measuring 9.5 cm in its greatest diameter , of uniform signal , with a cartilage cap exceeding 2 cm throughout most of its surface . \n ( figure 2 ) mri scan of the patient s left leg an ultrasound concluded an 8.8 cm pseudoaneurysm and the patient was admitted for urgent pre - op ct angio ( figure 3 and 4 ) and surgical exploration . \n ct angiogram 3d reconstruction- showing the bony exostoses and the popliteal aneurysm posterior to the right distal femur ct angiogram : showing the diameter size of the aneurysm to be 88.6 mm . \n the cross sectional image clearly shows the sharp bony exostoses that slowly eroded into the popliteal artery resulting in the pseudoaneurysm formation . \n the image also shows that the defect in the artery is still patent because the pseudoaneurysm is filling with contrast the popliteal artery was explored . \n ( figure 5 ) the proximal popliteal artery was found to have a 1 cm x 0.5 cm wall defect adjacent to the bony exostosis . \n ( figure 6)the exostosis was excised and the 4 cm of diseased artery repaired with end - to - end interpositional long saphenous vein graft . \n ( figure 7 ) intraoperative photograph showing the popliteal aneurysm intraoperative photograph showing the 1 cm x 0.5 cm defect in the popliteal artery wall caused by the sharp bony exostoses intraoperative photograph showing the end to end interpositional long saphenous vein graft post operatively the patient recovered without complication . \n he was followed up with an ultrasound doppler after 6 weeks demonstrating a patent vein graft and will undergo local vascular follow - up . \n his 6 month post - operative check - up revealed no complications but he will have regular follow - up for any painful , rapidly growing exostosis associated with his hereditary condition . \n diaphyseal aclasis is a rare genetic skeletal condition due to developmental abnormalities of the growth plate causing multiple cartilage covered exostoses to form on the surface of the metaphysis or the adjacent diaphysis region of long bones . \n diaphyseal aclasis is usually diagnosed in childhood however it is believed that radiologically the exostoses are present since birth . \n ( 3 ) vascular complications of the popliteal vessel occur due to ossification of the previously protective cartilage cap , around the 2 decade and relative immobility of the artery in the popliteal fossa between exiting hunter s canal and the trifurcation . \n ( 4 ) the artery undergoes chronic abrasion on the sharp exostosis forming a defect in the adventitia resulting in pseudoaneurysm formation . ( 5 ) it is controversial whether exostoses that lie near a vascular axis should be removed on identification to prevent vascular compromise from occurring . considering most exostoses are innocent , most authors suggest that surgical excision is only required when complications have occurred or malignant transformation is suspected . \n if preventative surgery is not performed , regular ultrasound doppler scans should be performed in order to screen for complications . \n ( 6 ) in addition to vascular complications , bony exostosis can also present acutely with nerve compression , bursitis due to bony irritation , stalk fracture or necrosis of the cartilaginous cap following infarction . \n ( 7 ) due to the acute presentation of this vascular complication there was no time for pre - operative tissue diagnosis , which would be routinely performed . \n it was important that the procedure was performed by an experienced orthopaedic tumour surgeon to ensure adequate margins were achieved . \n recent studies report a lifetime risk of sarcomatous transformation in single lesions of approximately 1% but up to 5% in hme . \n ( 8) the majority are chondrosarcomas , however , osteosarcomas and malignant fibrous histiocytomas have been reported . \n concerning features that warrant further investigation include : \n a rapidly enlarging mass , particularly in those beyond skeletal maturityshoulder girdle and pelvic exostosis ( 9)cartilage capsule exceeding 1.5 cm a rapidly enlarging mass , particularly in those beyond skeletal maturity shoulder girdle and pelvic exostosis ( 9 ) cartilage capsule exceeding 1.5 cm investigation with ultrasound , mri and image guided or open biopsy is advocated if an exostosis has concerning features . \n there are recent studies advocating pet / ct imaging to monitor known benign exostosis for malignant transformation . \n ( 10 ) due to the relative rarity of these lesions it is important to review the images and histology in a specialised bone tumour multi - disciplinary meeting . \n this case illustrates a late presentation of a known complication associated with diaphseal aclasis . in this age group \n we present one of the largest , non - ruptured , popliteal pseudo aneurysms reported . \n it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion of an increasing soft tissue lesion due to the risk of sarcomatous transformation in patients with mhe ; however , this focus delayed earlier presentation to vascular surgeons putting the patient at risk of a limb threatening rupture .",

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn).\n\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.\n\nJohn Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\".\n\nThe petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.\n\nThe European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",

Eyewitness reports say the driver, alleged to be Jones, got out of the car and ran away before coming back to grab cash from the vehicle before running away again, completely abandoning the car and other drivers who were potentially injured.\n\nBecause one of the drivers suffered a broken arm and wrist, Jones faces potential felony charges for allegedly leaving the scene of an accident, with a penalty that could carry up to the three years in jail.\n\nPolice in the video are seen finding the registration and saying it belongs to \"Jon Jones, the MMA fighter.\"\n\nPolice also found dirty clothes, a water bottle, loose change, a marijuana pipe and condoms.\n\nThe video also shows the damage done to the vehicle driven by the pregnant woman who was taken to the hospital following the accident after feeling like she was going to pass out. She was later examined and doctors discovered she had a fractured arm and wrist.\n\nFollowing Jones' arrest and release on $2,500 bond, UFC officials stripped him of his light-heavyweight title and suspended the New York native indefinitely.\n\nAs of yet, the district attorney for Bernalillo County, New Mexico hasn't officially taken the case involving Jones to the grand jury to seek indictment on the fighter. They have 60 days from the date of his arrest and release to file formal charges against the former champion.\n\nJones hasn't made any public appearances outside of his required presence at a New Mexico courthouse where he had his initial meeting with a judge, who allowed the fighter to stay out of custody on the $2,500 cash bond he posted after being arrested.",

brain barrier ( bbb ) breaks down in patients with tbi . \n , this compensation mechanism is disrupted in tbi , thereby cerebral edema can become more worse.1211 ) additionally , arf can alter the concentration of neurotransmitters or circulating cytokines , acid - base balance , hemostasis , and drug metabolism . \n increased circulating cytokines can lead to disruption of the bbb , allowing increased access to cytotoxic inflammatory cells , cytokines , complement , amino acids , and organic osmolytes.14 ) therefore , it has been reported that tbi patients with arf have a higher incidence of poor outcome when compared with tbi patients without renal dysfunction.12 ) renal replacement therapy for arf in the patient with tbi is challenging , because conventional ihd is known to lead to an increase in brain water content , even in non - tbi patients undergoing regular hemodialysis.5 ) compared to standard ihd , crrt has been shown to result in greater intracranial stability.615 ) during treatment with crrt , changes in osmolality and changes of urea and bicarbonate levels were much less than those during ihd.5 ) this intracranial stability can be achieved by improved cardiovascular stability , because various modes of crrt can be selected according to cardiovascular volume status.4 ) therefore , it can be stated that crrt has many advantages over conventional ihd in the treatment of arf for patients with tbi . \n the acute kidney injury network working group summarized the available evidence and presented absolute indications for initiation of crrt as follows ; a serum urea concentration > 224 mg / dl ( blood urea nitrogen [ bun ] > 100 mg / dl ) , hyperkalemia ( > 6 meq / l and electrocardiogram abnormalities ) , hypermagnesemia ( > 8 \n meq / l ) , severe acidosis ( ph < 7.15 ) , lactic acidosis related to metformin use and anuria with diuretic resistant volume overload.710 ) however , to our knowledge , there are no previous reports regarding indications for initiation of crrt for arf in patients with tbi . in our study , it was found that starting early crrt before when the urine output is reduced to less than 500 ml per day significantly prolonged survival time of tbi patients with post -

      "document": "By David Jones, Florida Today\n\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. \u0097 The SEC fined Florida coach Urban Meyer $30,000 for his comments about league officiating during Wednesday's SEC teleconference, commissioner Mike Slive announced Friday.\n\nMeyer will pay the fine himself, with no help from the school. He was upset at Georgia linebacker Nick Williams' hit on Tim Tebow in last week's 41-17 Gator win. It appeared on video it could have been called a late hit.\n\nThe school sent a tape of the play to the league office. Video of the hit circulated on the Internet since UF linebacker Brandon Spikes' yanking at the helmet of an UGA player resulted in a suspension earlier in the week.\n\n\"I'm not sure I'm allowed to give you that, what they said. I don't want to step out of line,\" Meyer said during the SEC teleconference. \"Once again I've always had great confidence in \u2014 that should have been a penalty in my opinion. Obviously it should have been. You've got to protect quarterbacks. That's the whole purpose. It's right in front of the referee. But once again I have great \u2014 I'm not sure how they're going to handle that but we do send it in and that was one of the plays we did send in.\"\n\nThe fine is the first since the conference's athletic directors, with the support of presidents and chancellors, voted to have all violations of SEC Bylaw 10.5.4 enforced by suspensions and fines. The change was largely because of Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin, Arkansas coach Bobby Petrino and Mississippi State's Dan Mullen all speaking publicly about officiating.\n\n\"Coach Meyer has violated the Southeastern Conference Code of Ethics,\" Slive said in a statement. \"SEC Bylaw 10.5.4 clearly states that the coaches, players and support personnel shall refrain from public criticism of officials. The league's athletics directors and presidents and chancellors have made it clear that negative public comments on officiating are not acceptable.\"\n\nMeyer also issued a statement on Friday.\n\n\"I have great respect for commissioner Mike Slive and the Southeastern Conference and I respect this decision. There was no intent to criticize an official after being asked about a situation that occurred last Saturday and I apologize for my remarks,\" he said.\n\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

      "document": "diabetes is the most frequent cause of end - stage renal disease in industrialised countries [ 1 , 2 ] . \n clinically , diabetic nephropathy is characterized by the development of albuminuria and a subsequent decline in glomerular filtration rate . \n this severe complication significantly influences the risk of cardiovascular disease as well as mortality and quality of life [ 3 , 4 ] . at present \n the most important identified risk factors are diabetes duration , arterial blood pressure , and glycaemic regulation . as evident from an increasing incidence of affected patients , \n however , there is still a great need for new strategies in the treatment and prevention of diabetic nephropathy . \n clear evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is multifactorial and triggered by a complex series of pathophysiological events . \n the inflammatory response in diabetes is highly complex involving proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines , for example , il1 \n the impact of complement activation on the diabetic kidney may well , in part , be mediated through induction of cytokine response and inflammation [ 911 ] . \n several studies have linked diabetic late - complications to the complement system of the innate immune system [ 12 , 13 ] . \n the complement system plays a crucial role in recognition and clearance of infectious microbes and the system forms a link between innate and adaptive immunity . \n the activation of the complement system results in the release of multiple inflammatory signaling molecules . \n ultimately complement activation leads to the formation of pore - forming membrane attack complexes ( macs ) that are inserted in the cell membranes to mediate lyses of the cell through osmotic stress . \n however , in mammalian cells , it has been shown that sublytic amounts of mac can increase production of il-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 dependent on nfb nuclear translocation . \n furthermore , macs are shown to have a mitogenic effect and cause release of basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet - derived growth factor from endothelial cells leading to fibrosis in neighboring cells including glomerular mesangial cells [ 16 , 17 ] . \n the latter effects of mac may explain the link between complement and diabetic kidney damage . \n three activations pathways exist : the classical , the alternative , and the lectin pathway . \n the present paper focuses on the lectin pathway , in which at least five soluble pattern - recognition molecules are characterized that may activate the complement system , that is , mannan - binding lectin ( mbl ) , h - ficolin , l - ficolin , m - ficolin , and collectin - k1 . \n the three ficolins utilize a fibrinogen - like domain that binds , for example , n - acetylglucosamine , n - acetylgalactosamine , and n - acetyl - neuraminic acid , whereas mbl and cl - k1 have a carbohydrate recognition domain and through this bind specifically to patterns of monosaccharides . a very recent publication reports a close association between ficolin and diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes . \n the observational design of the study , however , limits its ability to study a cause - effect relationship . when ficolins bind they all initiate activation of associated serine proteases ( mbl associated serine proteases , masps ) , which subsequently cleave the complement factors , c2 and c4 , leading to further complement activation [ 20 , 21 ] . \n eventually , complement activation leads to the formation of macs causing cell lyses or induction of fibrosis . the balance between activation and inhibition of the complement cascade is tightly controlled by regulatory proteins in order to prevent damage of healthy host cells . in diabetes \n , inappropriate effects of the complement system may be present as glycation - induced dysfunction of the complement inhibitory mechanism and consequently overactivation of the system is indicated [ 2325 ] . \n it is speculated that diabetic patients are exposed to uncontrolled complement attack partly due to altered molecular patterns on the cell surfaces as a consequence of high blood glucose [ 24 , 25 ] . \n most significantly , an association is seen between diabetic nephropathy and the lectin pathway [ 2628 ] . we have previously demonstrated direct cause - effect relationship between presence of mbl and worsening of kidney injury in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy [ 29 , 30 ] . \n we speculate that ficolins also exert detrimental effects in diabetes similar to mbl through activation of the lectin pathway as indicated in patients with type 1 diabetes . \n this study aimed to investigate the impact of ficolin b ( the orthologue to human m - ficolin ) on the development of diabetic nephropathy in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes . \n we used 11-week - old , female ficolin b knockout mice and age - matched , female c57bl/6j bomtac wild - type mice ( taconic , ry , denmark ) . \n the knockout ficolin b model was backcrossed more than 10 generations to a c57bl/6j bomtac genetic background ( own breeding ) . in each cage \n there were three to eight mice and they had free access to tap water and standard chow ( altromin number 1324 ; lage , germany ) . \n the environment was stable with a 12-hour light - dark cycle , temperature at 21  1c , and humidity of 55  5% . \n the ficolin b knockout mice and the wild - type mice were randomized into a diabetic and nondiabetic group ; thus four groups were made : ( 1 ) diabetic knockout mice ( n = 6 ) , ( 2 ) nondiabetic knockout mice ( n = 7 ) , ( 3 ) diabetic wild - type mice ( n = 11 ) , and ( 4 ) nondiabetic wild - type mice ( n = 11 ) . \n diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin ( stz ) dissolved in a cold 10  mm citrate buffer ( doses of 55  mg / kg body weight , sigma aldrich , st louis , mo , usa ) on five consecutive days . \n the 18-week experiment was initiated when the mice were classified as diabetic ( blood glucose > 15  mm ) . animals with more than 15% sustained weight loss , signs of illness , or persistent ketonuria were excluded from the study . \n blood glucose was measured from tail vein by contour ( bayer diabetes care , kgs . \n lyngby , denmark ) . with combur test d strip ( roche diagnostics gmbh , mannheim , germany ) \n two mice from each diabetic group were excluded because of insufficient increase in blood glucose levels . \n furthermore , two mice from the diabetic knockout group were excluded because of weight loss > 15% of body weight . \n the excluded mice were not included in the number of animals per group indicated above . \n spot urine was collected in eppendorf tubes on five consecutive days prior to sacrifice of the animals . \n the blood samples were drawn from under the tongue at baseline and from the retroorbital venous plexus at study end and collected in potassium edta tubes ( sarstedt , nmbrecht , germany ) . \n the animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine at 0.5  mg / g body weight and xylazine at 0.2  mg / g body weight ( ketaminol 4 vet and narcoxyl vet , resp . , \n urinary albumin excretion was determined by mouse albumin elisa quantification kit ( bethyl laboratories , inc . , \n urine creatinine was measured by isocratic high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) on a zorbax scx300 column ( agilent , usa ) using a slight modification of a method first reported by yuen et al . . \n in brief , 5  l urine was added to 100  l acetonitrile containing 0.5% acetic acid and vortexed for 15 seconds to extract the creatinine . \n after 15  min of 20c storage and centrifugation the supernatants were evaporated and then reconstituted with 25  l 5  mm sodium acetate , ph 4.1 . \n duplicate samples ( 10  ul each ) were fractionated on a 50  mm  2.1  mm zorbax scx300 column with an in - front scx guard column . \n isocratic hplc was performed at a flow rate of 1  ml / min , and uv absorbance was monitored at 225  nm . \n a standard curve was created by including a 2-fold dilution series of creatinine anhydrous ( sigma aldrich ) . \n this study was designed with two independent factors ; diabetes / nondiabetes and knockout / wild - type and thus analysed by two - way anova for normal distributed variable with equal variance . \n the main focus of interest was the interaction between the diabetic factor and the knockout factor ; that is , does ficolin b modify the effects of diabetes on the effect parameters ? if no interaction was found , the independent effects of diabetes and ficolin b on the kidney were estimated . \n for pairwise comparison , normal distributed data was tested with student 's t - test , whereas otherwise the wilcoxon mann - whitney rank sum test was used . \n data are given as mean ( 95% confidence interval ( ci ) ) unless else is stated . \n at baseline , the knockout mice on average weighed 20.0  g , which was slightly less than the wild type mice , 20.8  g ( p = 0.04 ) . \n no difference was found between the two diabetic groups or between the two nondiabetic groups ( table 1 ) . \n after 18 weeks an expected difference in body weight was observed between the diabetic and the nondiabetic mice independently of knockout status ( p < 0.001 ) . \n the nondiabetic mice weighed 3.2  g ( ci : 2.0  g4.3  g ) more than the diabetic mice . \n furthermore the diabetic knockout mice were significantly smaller than the diabetic wild type ( p < 0.05 ) . \n as presented in table 1 , blood glucose , estimated as area under the curve ( auc ) , did not differ between the two diabetic groups ( p = 0.69 ) or between the two nondiabetic groups ( p = 0.13 ) . \n the kidney weight was equally increased in diabetic wild - type mice , 24% ( ci : 13%36% ) , and in the diabetic knockout mice , 29% ( ci : 12%47% ) , compared to the respective control groups ( figure 2(a ) ) . no interaction between knockout and diabetes was found ( p = 0.60 ) , indicating that wild - type and knockout mice develop the same degree of diabetes - induced renal hypertrophy . \n the considerable body weight difference between the two diabetic groups at study end indicated that the kidney weight was to be normalised to the body weight . \n ficolin b did not modify the diabetes - induced increase in kidney weight when testing for interaction ( p = 0.11 ) . \n furthermore , no significant statistical difference was found in kidney weight per body weight between the diabetic wild - type , 1.95  mg / g , and the diabetic knockout , 2.89  mg / g ( p = 0.09 ) . \n the albumin - to - creatinine ration ( acr ) was higher among the diabetic wild - type mice , 76  mg / g ( ci : 50103  mg / g ) , compared to the nondiabetic wild - type mice , 44  mg / g ( ci : 2563  mg / g ) , p = 0.07 . \n similarly , the acr of diabetic knockout mice was 96  mg / g ( ci : 71122  mg / g ) compared to the nondiabetic knockout group , 34  mg / g ( ci : 2344  mg / g ) , p < 0.001 . as depicted in figure 3 no interaction was observed between diabetes and ficolin b knockout , p = 0.21 . \n in the present study we found no association between diabetes - induced kidney changes and the presence of ficolin b. we conclude that ficolin b is not responsible for , or a crucial contributory factor in , the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy . in our study , the kidney weight and to some extent the acr were altered by diabetes as expected . \n the diabetes - induced increase in kidney weight , measured by comparing the diabetic mice with the nondiabetic mice , was not statistically different between the wild - type and ficolin b knockout mice . \n the diabetes - induced increase in kidney weight was 24% in the wild - type mice and 29% in the ficolin b knockout mice . \n taking the lower body weight of the knockout mice into account , the difference in renal hypertrophy was still insignificant when comparing the wild - type mice and the ficolin b knockout mice . \n similarly , the diabetic change seen in acr was not altered in the absence of ficolin b. the experimental setup including four groups matched on age , body weight , and genetical background was a strength to the study , as the diabetes factor and the knockout factor were the only modulators of the outcome . \n most importantly both diabetic groups did reach and sustain blood glucose levels of above 15  mm . at study end , \n the body weight differed among groups , which impeded the analyses of the diabetic kidney damage , because the knockout mice appear to be more vulnerable to type 1 diabetes mellitus . \n our study provides important new information on the association between the lectin pathway and diabetic kidney damage . \n we are the first to investigate the role of ficolin b ( which corresponds to ficolin m in human ) in the inflammatory response of diabetic nephropathy . in mice with deficiency of mbl , \n the classical functional and physical renal changes normally seen in this experimental model of type 1 diabetes were modified [ 29 , 30 ] . \n the fact that ficolin b does not appear to modulate diabetic effects on the kidney emphasizes the importance of mbl compared with ficolin b. both mbl and ficolin b activate the lectin pathway of the complement system , but only deficiency of mbl has been shown to protect against diabetic kidney damage . \n this indicates that the role of the lectin pathway in the development of diabetic nephropathy is complex and may depend on the specific carbohydrate - binding properties of mbl as previously described . \n the function of other complement factors in the first parts of the lectin pathway ( e.g. , ficolin a and masps ) in the pathology of diabetic kidney disease remains unknown and must be explored in further studies . \n one study indicates that ficolin a and ficolin b exert a cooperatively defensive role in destroying streptococcus pneumoniae , suggesting a synergetic immunological effect . \n this emphasises the need for further investigations involving both mouse ficolins . in order to fully understand the involvement of the lectin pathway in the development of diabetic nephropathy , an additional parallel experiment with masps is of particular interest given that they represent the limiting downward step in the complement activation \n in conclusion , this study demonstrates that ficolin b does not modify the kidney weight and acr in a type 1 diabetes mouse model . \n this indicates that the role of the lectin pathway in the development of diabetic nephropathy is specific and that hyperglycaemia - induced glycations on renal cells may be more prone to bind mbl than ficolin b.",

The weather killed six people last week in Lombardy, Italy, where torrential rains have caused flooding and wreaked havoc on small villages located in river valleys.\n\n... An accused federalist who spent nine years in a Genoa prison for allegedly killing a judge in 1976 but was cleared of all charges in 1983, died in his Milan home.

Two boys and a girl were born exactly at the stroke of midnight of July 1, becoming the first babies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the paper reported in its first edition after Monday's events. The last baby born before the deadline was a girl, who will hold both British National Overseas and HKSAR passports. The proud parents welcomed the historical timing of their newborns.\n\n... On the eve of the handover, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Chang Hsiao-yen told reporters that he hoped Hong Kong could maintain its long-term stability and prosperity, as well as its democratic system.

ajinomoto pharmaceuticals , tokyo , japan ) in a 30-ml syringe up to three times through the working channel , and the submucosal transparency was restored ( fig . \n a clearer view of the surface of the muscular layer through the transparent submucosa enabled further submucosal dissection safely . \n peg irrigation also proved to be useful by making it possible to identify the oozing vessel precisely , facilitating direct hemostasis . a complete en bloc resection ( fig . \n 4 ) was obtained successfully in 80 minutes , and the specimen was fixed for histologic assessment ( fig . \n the patient experienced an uneventful recovery and was discharged home after 4 days of in - hospital observation . \n no adverse event related to the use of peg as an irrigation method was noted . \n histology showed a tubulovillous adenoma with high grade dysplasia , no lymph node or vascular invasion , and free horizontal and vertical margins . \n large , flat - elevated , homogeneous , granular - type laterally spreading tumor in the ascending colon of a patient referred for endoscopic submucosal dissection . \n after control of bleeding and flushing with water , submucosal hematoma and covered blood clot still impair visibility . \n note the restored transparency , allowing a better view of the submucosal layer and surface of the muscular layer . \n peg is a polymer of ethylene oxide with a wide range of applications in medicine 8 . \n it has been used in gastroenterology mainly as a laxative for bowel preparation before colonoscopy or the management of chronic constipation . \n peg also is safely used as a pharmaceutical ingredient in ointments , suppository formulations , creams , lotions , lubricants , coating materials of tablets , and solubilizers for injection 8 . \n this polymer has a low level of toxicity , and when absorbed , it is eliminated through hepatic or renal pathways 8 . \n previously , the only application of peg related to endoscopic resection has been reported in experimental settings , as a submucosal injectant 9 . \n peg irrigation is a simple and effective means to improve visibility in submucosal dissection , particularly when bleeding occurs ; it facilitates esd by allowing a better recognition of the submucosal fibers . \n as demonstrated in this case report , peg irrigation improved the field of view substantially and made it possible to continue esd in a safer fashion . \n when bleeding takes place during esd , hemostatic control with coagulation forceps or the knife blade is immediately attempted , together with water irrigation as needed . \n however , when the control of bleeding takes a long time and the field is occupied by blood or clots , irrigation with water is not very efficient , and visibility is compromised . in such situations , proceeding with blind hemostatic maneuvers without a clear vision of the submucosal space is hazardous and may lead not only to a failure of bleeding control but also , most importantly , to accidental damage and perforation of the muscularis propria layer . \n it is in this situation that we recommend cleaning the submucosal space by means of irrigation with peg . \n we assume that the effectiveness of peg irrigation to clear blood clots is due to its property as a dispersing agent ; however , the mechanism of this effect remains to be clarified . \n in addition , we have noted that peg irrigation is also useful when persistent bowel residual covers a colonic flat lesion . \n peg irrigation makes it possible to clean the lesion surface very effectively , optimizing conditions for chromoendoscopy and magnifying the examination . in conclusion \n , we propose a novel use for peg during endoscopic procedures , aimed at cleaning the submucosal space of blood clots and improving visibility for submucosal dissection whenever bleeding occurs and can not be controlled promptly . \n further studies are required to reproduce our experience in a large number of patients and to confirm the reliability of this approach .",

A reading below 50 indicates falling output.\n\nIt is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013.\n\nFirms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum.\n\nA slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production.\n\nThe index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low.\n\nRob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth.\n\n\"The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.\"\n\nLast week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector.\n\nDavid Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: \"Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality.\n\n\"An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk.\n\n\"A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.\"\n\nThe Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month.\n\nLee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.\n\n\"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"",

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Final Report of the American Indian Policy Review \n        Committee, published in 1977, made a number of recommendations \n        regarding the United States administration of its trust \n        relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes and their \n        members, many of which have not been implemented.\n            (2) There has been no general, comprehensive review of the \n        United States trust relationship with federally recognized \n        Indian tribes since the publication of the Final Report of the \n        American Indian Policy Review Committee.\n            (3) The trust relationship has evolved over time and there \n        is a clear need to re-examine the administration of the United \n        States constitutional trust responsibility.\n            (4) The duties administered by Federal agencies charged \n        with protecting federally recognized Indian tribal trust \n        resources and providing services often conflict with other \n        duties discharged by the same or separate Federal agencies and \n        departments and it is the beneficiaries of the trust \n        relationship that suffer as a result.\n            (5) In carrying out its trust responsibilities to federally \n        recognized Indian tribes and their members, it is crucial that \n        Congress have the benefit of a review of the United States \n        trust relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes to \n        improve its ability to exercise oversight over the Executive \n        Branch, pursue policies to empower tribal self-determination, \n        and better administer the trust relationship.\n\nSEC. 3.

HP is seeing high demand for the bargain-priced tablets, which first retailed for $500 last month, and has struggled to keep its inventory alert system online.\n\nCorcoran described the sudden demand for the TouchPad as \"kind of bittersweet.\" In a statement, HP offered the following explanation for discontinuing the products: \"WebOS devices have not gained enough traction with consumers.\"\n\nWhile HP intends to stop making devices that run the company's downtrodden mobile operating system, Richard Kerris, an HP vice president, wrote in a message to developers on Friday saying his team plans to continue developing the software. HP CEO Leo Apotheker has said the company has explored licensing deals for webOS with other electronics manufacturers.\n\nBargain hunters are scheming on blogs and social media websites to share tips on how to score discounted TouchPads. The two TouchPad models have shot to the top spots on Amazon.com's list of best-selling electronics.\n\nThe fire sale has spread to Europe. The Pre3, which debuted in the UK and France less than a week ago, is now priced at $75, \u00e2\u0082\u00ac59 or \u00c2\u00a349, the spokeswoman wrote in e-mails. It previously cost about $500 in Europe. The device will be unlocked, allowing people in the United States to connect to AT&T's or T-Mobile's networks.\n\nHP will not allow customers to return the device, the spokeswoman wrote.

      "document": "I messed up a few weeks ago. I sent a not-so-nice email to a colleague I\u2019ll call Randy. I did it after I got a fervent complaint from a new client about him. Randy was negotiating something on my behalf and, from the client\u2019s perspective, took a firm stand in a way that did not go over well. The client said the one thing that escalates my blood pressure in a matter of seconds: \u201cRandy could stand to learn a lesson or two from you about doing business in a trustworthy way.\u201d For me, this cued the entrance of the high horse and I immediately climbed aboard.\n\nHere\u2019s the background that might absolve me (or at least invoke your empathy): while it was the first time I was working with Randy, it wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d heard this complaint about him; I was in the middle of a seven-city travel sprint with too many all-day meetings; and I was unaccustomed to being represented by someone else and therefore felt out of control (probably my least favorite feeling in the world).\n\nWhatever my rationalization, how I handled it reminds me of Mickey Mantle\u2019s assessment of himself as a role model: \u201cDon\u2019t be like me.\u201d I was indignant, self-righteous, and completely justified (I thought) as the Trust Superhero: \u201cI must defend and protect my clients to the end! I must teach the world the proper ways of trust!\u201d\n\nI \u201cdidn\u2019t have time\u201d to call Randy, so I cooled off for a few hours and crafted an exacting email, which I sent at 9 p.m. I was proud of myself for being wise enough to wait that long. I should have waited longer. The next day I felt like I do when I indulge in a Big Mac craving: I\u2019m blissed-out while I\u2019m gorging on it, then thirty minutes later I feel like crap.\n\nWhile it didn\u2019t take me terribly long to figure out I had handled the situation poorly, it took me nearly a month to call and apologize. My interactions with Randy in the interim were brief, transactional, and email-based. I kept my distance and continued to blame him (\u201cHe should have responded to my complaints immediately!\u201d). When we finally spoke (this time I phoned), I learned he was truly perplexed about what he had done that had caused so much upset. He had been sick that day and for several weeks afterwards. He had opted for silence as a response to my email because he figured that things would look differently with time. He was caring and gracious on the phone. And in our conversation I learned some things I hadn\u2019t known before, like the fact that he\u2019s a big advocate of women and hates it when we don\u2019t get what we deserve. If he was abrasive in negotiating with my client, he felt he was doing it on my behalf. Apparently he too likes to defend and protect his clients\u2014in this case, me\u2014to the end.\n\nTwelve-step programs advocate \u201cmaking amends;\u201d Landmark Education teaches \u201cgetting complete.\u201d Whatever you call it, there\u2019s a lot to be gained from doing it. Here are a few things I re-learn every time I set things right:\n\nWhat it takes to clean up a mess are qualities that I have more of on some days than others: courage, humility, self-awareness. Sounds an awful lot like what it takes to cultivate enduring relationships that are built on a solid foundation of trust.\n\nThanks, Randy, for being such a good teacher.",

      "document": "The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directed NASA to develop SLS, to continue development of a crew vehicle, and to prepare infrastructure at Kennedy Space Center to enable processing and launch of the launch system. To fulfill this direction, NASA formally established the SLS launch vehicle program in 2011. Then, in 2012, NASA aligned the requirements for the Orion program with those of the newly created SLS and EGS programs. Figure 1 provides details about each SLS hardware element and its source as well as identifies the major portions of the Orion spacecraft. In order to facilitate Congressional oversight and track program progress, NASA establishes an agency baseline commitment\u2014the cost and schedule baselines against which the program may be measured\u2014for all projects that have a total life cycle cost of $250 million or more. NASA refers to these projects as major projects or programs. When the NASA Administrator determines that development cost growth within a major project or program is likely to exceed the development cost estimate by 15 percent or more, or a program milestone is likely to be delayed from the baseline\u2019s date by 6 months or more, NASA replans the project and submits a report to this committee\u2014the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives\u2014and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. Should a major project or program exceed its development cost baseline by more than 30 percent, the program must be reauthorized by the Congress and rebaselined by NASA in order for the contractor to continue work beyond a specified time frame. NASA tied the SLS and EGS program cost and schedule baselines to the uncrewed first mission\u2014known now as Artemis-1\u2014originally planned for November 2018. The Orion program\u2019s cost and schedule baselines are tied to a crewed second mission\u2014known as Artemis-2\u2014planned for April 2023. In April 2017, we found that given combined effects of ongoing technical challenges in conjunction with limited cost and schedule reserves, it was unlikely that these three programs would achieve the originally committed November 2018 launch readiness date. Cost reserves are for costs that are expected to be incurred\u2014for instance, to address project risks\u2014but are not yet allocated to a specific part of the project. Schedule reserves are extra time in project schedules that can be allocated to specific activities, elements, and major subsystems to mitigate delays or address unforeseen risks. We recommended that NASA confirm whether the November 2018 launch readiness date was achievable and, if warranted, propose a new, more realistic Artemis-1 date and report to Congress on the results of its schedule analysis. NASA agreed with both recommendations and stated that it was no longer in its best interest to pursue the November 2018 launch readiness date. Subsequently, NASA approved a new Artemis-1 schedule of December 2019, with 6 months of schedule reserve available to extend the date to June 2020, and revised the costs that it expects to incur (see table 1). In June 2019, we found that within 1 year of announcing a delay for the first human spaceflight mission, senior NASA officials acknowledged that the revised Artemis-1 launch date of December 2019 was unachievable and the June 2020 launch date (which takes into account schedule reserves) was unlikely. These officials estimated that there were 6 to 12 months of schedule risk associated with this later date, which means the first launch may occur as late as June 2021 if all risks are realized. As we found in June 2019, this would be a 31-month delay from the schedule originally established in the programs\u2019 baselines. Officials attributed the additional schedule delay to continued production challenges with the SLS core stage and the Orion crew and service modules. NASA officials also stated that the 6 to 12 months of risk to the launch date accounts for the possibilities that SLS and Orion testing and final cross-program integration and testing at Kennedy Space Center may result in further delays. As we noted in our report, these 6 to 12 months of schedule risk do not include the effects, if any, of the federal government shutdown that occurred in December 2018 and January 2019. In commenting on our June 2019 report, NASA stated that its Lunar 2024 planning activities would include an Artemis-1 schedule assessment. However, in July 2019, NASA reassigned its senior leaders responsible for human spaceflight programs. The NASA Administrator stated in August 2019 that, as a result, the agency does not plan to finalize schedule plans for Artemis-1 until new leadership is in place at the agency. Additional details follow on the status of each program, including cost, schedule, and technical challenges. SLS. As we found in June 2019, ongoing development issues with the SLS core stage\u2014which includes four main engines and the software necessary to command and control the vehicle\u2014contributed to the SLS program not being able to meet the June 2020 launch date. Officials from the SLS program and Boeing, the contractor responsible for building the core stage, provided several reasons for the delays. These reasons include the underestimation of the complexity of manufacturing and assembling the core stage engine section\u2014where the RS-25 engines are mated to the core stage\u2014and those activities have taken far longer than expected. Since our June 2019 report, based on our review of the program\u2019s most recent status reports, NASA has reported progress across many parts of the SLS program. For example, NASA has delivered the four RS-25 engines to Michoud Assembly Facility. NASA has also completed qualification testing of all components of the boosters and reports that there is schedule margin remaining for the booster deliverables. In addition, NASA reports that Boeing has made continued progress and expects that the core stage will be complete and ready for testing in December 2019. Completion of the core stage will represent a significant milestone for the program. In June 2019, we found that that SLS program has been underreporting its development cost growth since the December 2017 replan. This underreporting is because of a decision to shift some costs to future missions while not adjusting the baseline costs downward to reflect this shift. The SLS development cost baseline established in August 2014 for Artemis-1 includes cost estimates for the main vehicle elements\u2014stages, liquid engines, boosters\u2014and other areas. According to program officials, because of the December 2017 replan process, NASA decided that costs included as part of the SLS Artemis-1 baseline cost estimate would be more appropriately accounted for as costs for future flights. Thus, NASA decided not to include those costs, approximately $782 million, as part of the revised SLS Artemis-1 cost estimate. However, NASA did not lower the $7 billion SLS development cost baseline to account for this significant change in assumptions and shifting of costs to future flights. This decision presents challenges in accurately reporting SLS cost growth over time. NASA\u2019s decision not to adjust the cost baseline downward to reflect the reduced mission scope obscures cost growth for Artemis-1. In June 2019, we found that NASA\u2019s cost estimate as of fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 for the SLS program indicated development cost growth had increased by $1 billion, or 14.7 percent. However, our analysis showed that development cost growth actually increased by $1.8 billion or 29.0 percent, when the development baseline is lowered to account for the reduced mission scope. Essentially, NASA is holding the baseline costs steady, while reducing the scope of work included in current cost estimates (see figure 2). As NASA determines its new schedule for the first mission, it is likely this cost growth will increase as additional time in the schedule leads to additional costs. In our June 2019 report, we recommended that the SLS program calculate its development cost growth using a baseline that is appropriately adjusted for scope and costs NASA has determined are not associated with the first flight, and determine if the development cost growth has increased by 30 percent or more. NASA agreed with the recommendation and NASA officials stated that they plan to implement the recommendation when new leadership is in place for the human space exploration programs. Looking ahead, based on our review of the program\u2019s most recent status reports, completing core stage manufacturing and integration and green run testing will be the critical path\u2014the path of longest duration through the sequence of activities in the schedule\u2014for the SLS program. During green run testing, NASA will fuel the completed core stage with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and fire the integrated four main engines for about 500 seconds. The green run test carries risks because it is the first time that several things are being done beyond just this initial fueling. For example, it is also the first time NASA will fire the four main engines together, test the integrated engine and core stage auxiliary power units in flight-like conditions, and use the SLS software in an integrated flight vehicle. In addition, NASA will conduct the test on the Artemis-1 flight vehicle hardware, which means the program would have to repair any damage from the test before flight. Orion. While the Orion program\u2019s schedule performance is measured only to the Artemis-2 mission, we found in June 2019 that the program was not on schedule to support the June 2020 launch date for the first mission. This was due to delays with the European Service Module and component issues for the avionics systems for the crew module, including issues discovered during testing. We found that these specific problems were resolved by the time of our report, but had already contributed to the inability of the program to meet the June 2020 launch date. Since we last reported, as of August 2019, the Orion program has completed significant events including completing the crew module and the service module prior to integration and conducting a test to demonstrate the ability to abort a mission should a life-threatening failure occur during launch. The program is tracking no earlier than October 2020 for an Artemis-1 launch date but that does not reflect the ongoing agency-wide schedule assessment noted above. In June 2019, we found that the Orion program has reported development cost growth but is not measuring that growth using a complete cost estimate. In summer 2018, the Orion program reported development cost growth of $379 million, or 5.6 percent above its $6.768 billion development cost estimate. Program officials explained that the major drivers of this cost growth were the slip of the Artemis-1 launch date, which reflected delays in the delivery of the service module; Orion contractor underperformance; and NASA-directed scope increase. However, during our review, Orion program officials originally stated that this cost estimate assumes an Artemis-2 launch date of September 2022, which is 7 months earlier than the program\u2019s agency baseline commitment date of April 2023 that forms the basis for commitments between NASA, the Congress, and Office of Management and Budget. Subsequently, during the review, program officials told us that its cost projections fund one of those 7 months. In either case, NASA\u2019s current cost estimate for the Orion program is not complete because it does not account for costs that NASA would incur through April 2023. As of September 2019, the program was targeting October 2022 for the Artemis-2 launch. In June 2019, we recommended that the Orion program update its cost estimate to reflect its committed Artemis-2 baseline date of April 2023. In its response, NASA partially agreed with our recommendation. NASA stated that providing the estimate to the forecasted launch date\u2014 September 2022\u2014rather than to the committed baseline date of April 2023 is the most appropriate approach. However, by developing cost estimates only to the program\u2019s goals and not relative to the established baseline, the Orion program is not providing NASA or the Congress the means of measuring progress relative to the baseline. We continue to believe that NASA should fully implement this recommendation. Looking ahead, based on our review of the program\u2019s most recent status reports, there is an emerging issue that may delay schedule further for the first mission. Namely, there is the risk of damage to the Orion capsule during travel to and from integrated testing at Plum Brook Station in Ohio. The program office is studying whether it will be able to safely transport the integrated crew and service modules via the Super Guppy airplane as planned or if it will have to use an alternate airplane. We will continue to monitor this effort. Beyond Artemis-1, the Orion program must also complete development efforts for future missions. For example, the Artemis-2 crew module will need environmental control and life support systems, system updates from Artemis-1, and updated software to run these new elements. EGS. At the time of our June 2019 report, the EGS program was expecting to have facilities and software ready by the planned June 2020 launch date. We found that the program had overcome many challenging development hurdles that led to previous schedule delays. These hurdles included completing and moving the Mobile Launcher\u2014a platform that carries the rocket to the launch pad and includes a number of connection lines that provide SLS and Orion with power, communications, coolant, fuel, and stabilization prior to launch\u2014into the Vehicle Assembly Building for the multi-element verification and validation processes. Since our June 2019 report, the program is now targeting an Artemis-1 launch date of August 2020. According to NASA officials, the delay is primarily driven by challenges encountered installing ground support equipment on the Mobile Launcher and developing software, and does not reflect the ongoing agency-wide schedule assessment. The program has operated within the costs established for the June 2020 launch date, $3.2 billion, but officials stated that NASA is reevaluating the program\u2019s development cost performance and will establish an updated baseline when new leadership is in place. Moving forward, based on our review of the program\u2019s most recent status reports, the program has to complete the multi-element verification and validation process for the Mobile Launcher and Vehicle Assembly Building and complete its two software development efforts. Additionally, the EGS program is responsible for the final integration of the three programs. NASA officials stated that the 6 to 12 months of risk to the June 2020 launch date includes risk associated with EGS completing this integration that includes test and checkout procedures after SLS and Orion components arrive. Officials explained that the EGS risk is based on a schedule risk analysis that considered factors such as historical pre- launch integrated test and check out delays and the learning curve associated with a new vehicle. As previously stated, our prior work has shown that the integration and test phase often reveals unforeseen challenges leading to cost growth and schedule delays. NASA is currently embarking on an aggressive goal to return humans to the lunar surface in 2024. To achieve this goal, NASA not only needs SLS, Orion, and EGS to have completed their first two test missions, but is also developing several new systems. These new systems include a Lunar Gateway that will orbit the moon, landers that will transport astronauts from the Gateway to the lunar surface, and new space suits. Human spaceflight projects face inherent technical, design, and integration risks because they are complex, specialized, and are pushing the state of the art in space technology. Moreover, these programs can be very costly and span many years, which means they may also face changes in direction from Administrations and the Congress. Meeting the 2024 goal will also be challenging given the effort needed to better manage SLS, Orion, and EGS, coupled with the addition of the new programs, which are likely to compete for management attention and resources. Nevertheless, our past work has identified a range of actions that NASA can take to better position its human spaceflight programs for success. Today I would like to highlight three lessons from the SLS, Orion, and EGS programs that NASA can apply to improve the management of its human spaceflight programs. Enhance Contract Management and Oversight to Improve Program Outcomes. Over the past several years, we and the NASA Office of the Inspector General have identified shortcomings related to NASA\u2019s management and oversight of its human spaceflight contracts. These shortcomings have left NASA ill-positioned to identify early warning signs of impending schedule delays and cost growth, reap the potential benefits of competition, and achieve desired results through contractor incentives. In July 2014, we found that NASA allowed high-value modifications to the SLS contracts to remain undefinitized for extended periods\u2014in one instance a modification remained undefinitized for 30 months. Undefinitized contract actions such as these authorize contractors to begin work before reaching a final agreement with the government on terms and conditions. We have previously found that while undefinitized contract actions may be necessary under certain circumstances, they are considered risky in part because the government may incur unnecessary costs if requirements change before the contract action is definitized. Because lack of agreement on terms of the modification prolonged NASA\u2019s timeframes for definitizing, the establishment of contractor cost and schedule baselines necessary to monitor performance was delayed. Specifically, we found in July 2014 that, in most cases, the SLS program did not receive complete earned value management data derived from approved baselines on these SLS contracts. Earned value, or the planned cost of completed work and work in progress, can provide accurate assessments of project progress, produce early warning signs of impending schedule delays and cost overruns, and provide unbiased estimates of anticipated costs at completion. In July 2014, we also found the SLS program could be in a favorable position to compete contracts for the exploration upper stage, the upper stage engine, and advanced boosters that it expected to use on future variants of the launch vehicle. At that time, except for the RS- 25 engines, NASA\u2019s contracting approach for the SLS program did not commit the program beyond the hardware needed for the second mission, and we found that moving forward the agency would be in a position to take advantage of the evolving launch vehicle market. We found that an updated assessment of the launch vehicle market could better position NASA to sustain competition, control costs, and better inform the Congress about the long-term affordability of the program. We recommended that before finalizing acquisition plans for future capability variants, NASA should assess the full range of competition opportunities and provide to the Congress the agency\u2019s assessment of the extent to which development and production of future elements of the SLS could be competitively procured. NASA agreed with the recommendation, which we have identified as among those that warrant priority attention. Since we made that recommendation, NASA has awarded a sole- source contract for the upper stage engine and agency officials told us in July 2018 that they planned to incorporate additional booster development under the existing contract. This further limits an opportunity for competition for the program. Our body of work on contracting has shown that competition in contracting is a key element for achieving the best return on investment for taxpayers. We have found that promoting competition increases the potential for acquiring quality goods and services at a lower price and that noncompetitive contracts carry the risk of overspending because, among other reasons, they have been negotiated without the benefit of competition to help establish pricing. In July 2016, we found that the lack of earned value management data for the SLS Boeing core stage contract persisted. Without this information, some 4.5 years after contract award, the program continued to be in a poor position to understand the extent to which technical challenges with the core stage were having schedule implications or the extent to which they may have required reaching into the program\u2019s cost reserves. In October 2018, the NASA Office of Inspector General reported that NASA does not require Boeing to report detailed information on development costs for the two core stages and exploration upper stage, making it difficult for the agency to determine if the contractor is meeting cost and schedule commitments for each deliverable. The NASA Office of Inspector General found that given the cost-reporting structure, the agency is unable to determine the cost of a single core stage. Internally, Boeing tracks all individual costs but submits a combined statement of labor hours and material costs through the one contract line item for all its development activities. NASA approximates costs based on numerous monthly and quarterly reviews with the contractor to track the progress of each individual deliverable. The NASA Office of Inspector General made a number of recommendations aimed at improving reporting relative to the core stage contract. Among these was a specific recommendation to separate each deliverable into its own contract line item number for tracking performance, cost, and award fees. NASA concurred with this recommendation and is currently renegotiating the core stage contract with Boeing. In June 2019, we found that NASA\u2019s approach to incentivizing Boeing for the SLS stages and Lockheed Martin for the Orion crew spacecraft have not always achieved overall desired program outcomes. NASA paid over $200 million in award fees from 2014-2018 related to contractor performance on the SLS stages and Orion spacecraft contracts, but the programs continue to fall behind schedule and incur cost overruns. For example, in its December 2018 award fee letter to Boeing in which the contractor earned over $17 million in award fees, NASA\u2019s fee determination official noted that the significant schedule delays on this contract have caused NASA to restructure the flight manifest for SLS. For the Lockheed Martin Orion contract, the contractor earned over $29 million for the award fee period ending April 2017. NASA noted that Lockheed Martin was not able to maintain its schedule for the crew service module and that the contractor\u2019s schedule performance had decreased significantly over the previous year. In June 2019, we reported that our past work shows that when incentive contracts are properly structured, the contractor has profit motive to keep costs low, deliver a product on time, and make decisions that help ensure the quality of the product. Our prior work also shows, however, that incentives are not always effective tools for achieving desired acquisition outcomes. We have found that, in some cases, there are significant disconnects between contractor performance for which the contractor was awarded the majority of award fees possible without achieving desired program results. Additionally, we have found that some agencies did not have methods, data, or performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of award fees. As part of our June 2019 report, we recommended that NASA direct the SLS and Orion programs to reevaluate their strategies for incentivizing contractors and determine whether they could more effectively incentivize contractors to achieve the outcomes intended as part of ongoing and planned contract negotiations. NASA agreed with the intent of this recommendation and stated that the SLS and Orion program offices reevaluate their strategies for incentivizing contract performance as part of contracting activities including contract restructures, contract baseline adjustments, and new contract actions. We will continue to follow-up on the actions the agency is taking to address this recommendation after its ongoing contract negotiations are complete. Minimize Risky Programmatic Decisions to Better Position Programs for Successful Execution. Through our reviews of NASA\u2019s human spaceflight programs, we have found that NASA leadership has approved programmatic decisions that compound technical challenges. These decisions include approving cost and schedule baselines that do not follow best practices, establishing insufficient cost and schedule reserves, and operating under aggressive schedules. As a result, these programs have been at risk of cost growth and schedule delays since NASA approved their baselines. In July 2015, we found that NASA generally followed best practices in preparing the SLS cost and schedule baseline estimates for the limited portion of the program life cycle covered through launch readiness for the first test flight of SLS. However, we could not deem the cost estimate fully reliable because it did not fully meet the credibility best practice. While an independent NASA office reviewed the cost estimate developed by the program and as a result the program made some adjustments, officials did not commission the development of a separate independent cost estimate to compare to the program cost estimate to identify areas of discrepancy or difference. In addition, the program did not cross-check its cost estimate using an alternative methodology. The purpose of developing a separate independent cost estimate and cross-checking the estimate is to test the program\u2019s cost estimate for reasonableness and, ultimately, to validate the cost estimate. In July 2016, we found that the Orion program\u2019s cost and schedule estimates were not reliable based on best practices for producing high-quality estimates. For example, the cost estimate lacked necessary support and the schedule estimate did not include the level of detail required for high-quality estimates. Therefore, we recommended that NASA perform an updated joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis including updating cost and schedule estimates in adherence with cost and schedule estimating best practices, which we have identified as among those recommendations that warrant priority. NASA officials have stated that they have no plans to implement our recommendation. In commenting on the July 2016 report, NASA stated that the agency reviewed, in detail, the Orion integrated cost/schedule and risk analysis methodology and determined the rigor to be a sufficient basis for the agency commitments. However, without sound cost and schedule estimates, decision makers do not have a clear understanding of the cost and schedule risk inherent in the program or important information needed to make programmatic decisions. We continue to believe that NASA should fully implement our recommendation. In our 2017 High-Risk Report, we highlighted concerns that all three programs\u2014SLS, Orion, and EGS\u2014were operating with limited cost reserves, limiting each program\u2019s ability to address risks and unforeseen technical challenges. For example, we found in July 2016 that the Orion program was planning to maintain low levels of cost reserves until later in the program. The lack of cost reserves at that time had caused the program to defer work to address technical issues to stay within budget. Also in our 2017 High-Risk Report, we highlighted concerns regarding each program managing to an aggressive internal NASA launch readiness date. This approach creates an environment for programs to make decisions based on reduced knowledge to meet a date that is not realistic. For example, the EGS program had consolidated future schedule activities to prepare the Mobile Launcher\u2014the vehicle used to bring SLS to the launch pad\u2014to meet its internal goal. The program acknowledged that consolidating activities\u2014which included conducting verification and validation concurrent with installation activities\u2014increased risk because of uncertainties about how systems not yet installed may affect the systems already installed. Officials added, however, that this concurrency is necessary to meet the internal schedule. Subsequently, as discussed above, NASA delayed its committed launch readiness date. Improve Transparency into Costs for Long-term Plans. As we previously reported, a key best practice for development efforts is that requirements need to be matched to resources (for example, time, money, and people) at program start. In the past, we have found that NASA programs, including the Constellation Program, did not have sufficient funding to match demanding requirements. Funding gaps can cause programs to delay or delete important activities and thereby increase risks. In addition, since May 2014, we have found there has been a lack of transparency into the long-term costs of these human spaceflight programs. As discussed above, the EGS and SLS programs do not have a cost and schedule baseline that covers activities beyond the first planned flight. In addition, as previously noted, the Orion program does not have a baseline beyond the second planned flight. As a result, NASA is now committing to spend billions of taxpayer dollars for missions that do not have a cost and schedule baseline against which to assess progress. To that end, we have made recommendations in the past on the need for NASA to baseline these programs\u2019 costs for capabilities beyond the first mission; however, a significant amount of time has passed without NASA taking steps to fully implement these recommendations. Specifically, among those recommendations that we have identified as warranting priority attention, in May 2014, we recommended that, to provide Congress with the necessary insight into program affordability, ensure its ability to effectively monitor total program costs and execution, and to facilitate investment decisions, NASA should: Establish a separate cost and schedule baseline for work required to support the SLS for the second mission and report this information to the Congress through NASA\u2019s annual budget submission. If NASA decides to fly the SLS configuration used in the second mission beyond that mission, we recommended that it establish separate life cycle cost and schedule baseline estimates for those efforts, to include funding for operations and sustainment, and report this information annually to Congress via the agency\u2019s budget submission. Establish separate cost and schedule baselines for each additional capability that encompass all life cycle costs, to include operations and sustainment. This is important because NASA intends to use the increased capabilities of the SLS, Orion, and EGS well into the future. As part of the latter recommendation, we stated that, when NASA could not fully specify costs due to lack of well-defined missions or flight manifests, the agency instead should forecast a cost estimate range\u2014 including life cycle costs\u2014having minimum and maximum boundaries and report these baselines or ranges annually to Congress via the agency\u2019s budget submission. In its comments on our 2014 report, NASA partially concurred with these two recommendations, noting that much of what it had already done or expected to do would address them. For example, the agency stated that establishing the three programs as separate efforts with individual cost and schedule commitments met the intent of our recommendation. NASA also stated that its plans to track and report development, operations, and sustainment costs in its budget to Congress as the capabilities evolved would also meet the intent of the recommendation. In our response, we stated that while NASA\u2019s prior establishment of three separate programs lends some insight into expected costs and schedule at the broader program level, it does not meet the intent of the two recommendations because cost and schedule identified at that level is unlikely to provide the detail necessary to monitor the progress of each block against a baseline. Further, we stated that reporting the costs via the budget process alone will not provide information about potential costs over the long term because budget requests neither offer all the same information as life-cycle cost estimates nor serve the same purpose. Life-cycle cost estimates establish a full accounting of all program costs for planning, procurement, operations and maintenance, and disposal and provide a long-term means to measure progress over a program\u2019s life span. We continue to believe that NASA should fully implement these recommendations. As NASA considers these lessons, it is important that the programs place a high priority on quality, for example, holding suppliers accountable to deliver high-quality parts for their products through such activities as regular supplier audits and performance evaluations of quality and delivery. As we found in June 2019, both the SLS and Orion programs have struggled at times with the quality of parts and components. For example, the Orion contractor has had a number of issues with subcontractor-supplied avionics system components failing during testing that have required time to address. NASA has highlighted concerns over the contractor\u2019s ability to manage its subcontractors and the resulting significant cost, schedule, and technical risk impacts to the program. And the SLS program faced setbacks after its contractor did not verify the processes that its vendors were using to clean the fuel lines, resulting in delays to resolve residue and debris issues.

      "summary": "NASA is undertaking a trio of closely related programs to continue human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. These three programs include a launch vehicle, a crew capsule, and the associated ground systems at Kennedy Space Center. All three programs are working towards a launch readiness date of June 2020 for the first mission. NASA then plans for these systems to support future human space exploration goals, which include seeking to land two astronauts on the lunar surface. GAO has a body of work highlighting concerns over NASA's management and oversight of these programs. This statement discusses (1) the cost and schedule status of NASA's human spaceflight programs and (2) lessons that NASA can apply to improve its management of its human spaceflight programs. This statement is based on eight reports issued from 2014 to 2019 and selected updates as of September 2019. For the updates, GAO analyzed recent program status reports on program progress. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) three related human spaceflight programs are in the integration and test phase of development, a phase of the acquisition process that often reveals unforeseen challenges leading to cost growth and schedule delays. Since GAO last reported on the status of these programs in June 2019, each program has made progress. For example, the Orion program conducted a key test to demonstrate the ability to abort a mission should a life-threatening failure occur during launch. As GAO found in June 2019, however, the programs continue to face significant schedule delays. In November 2018, within one year of announcing an up to 19-month delay for the three programs\u2014the Space Launch System (SLS) vehicle, the Orion crew spacecraft, and Exploration Ground Systems (EGS)\u2014NASA senior leaders acknowledged the revised launch date of June 2020 is unlikely. In addition, any issues uncovered during integration and testing may push the date as late as June 2021. Moreover, GAO found that NASA's calculations of cost growth for the SLS program is understated by more than 750 million dollars. GAO's past work has identified a number of lessons that NASA can apply to improve its management of its human spaceflight programs. For example, NASA should enhance contract management and oversight to improve program outcomes. NASA's past approach in this area has left it ill-positioned to identify early warning signs of impending schedule delays and cost growth or reap the benefits of competition. In addition, NASA's approach to incentivizing contractors through contract award fees did not result in desired outcomes for the SLS and Orion programs. Further, NASA should minimize risky programmatic decisions to better position programs for successful execution. This includes providing sufficient cost and schedule reserves to, among other things, address unforseen risk. Finally, realistic cost estimates and assessments of technical risk are particularly important at the start of an acquisition program. But NASA has historically provided little insight into the future cost of these human spaceflight programs, limiting the information useful to decision makers. GAO has made 19 recommendations in these eight prior reports to strengthen NASA's acquisition management of SLS, Orion, and EGS. NASA generally agreed with GAO's recommendations, and has implemented seven recommendations. Further action is needed to fully implement the remaining recommendations.",

      "document": "States have three options for designing their CHIP programs: Medicaid expansion CHIP, separate CHIP, and combination CHIP. Medicaid expansion CHIP. States may operate CHIP as an extension of their Medicaid programs. Under Medicaid expansion CHIP, states expand income eligibility levels for children beyond those of the state\u2019s Medicaid program. Medicaid expansion CHIP programs must follow Medicaid rules, including providing all Medicaid covered benefits to enrolled children. Separate CHIP. States may operate their CHIP programs separate from their Medicaid programs. In so doing, the states are not required to follow the same rules as Medicaid; thus, these states have some additional flexibility in designing CHIP, such as determining which benefits to offer and how, if at all, to charge premiums. Combination CHIP. States may have a combination program, where they operate a separate CHIP program, as well as a Medicaid expansion CHIP program, each for a different population of children. For example, some states that operate combination CHIP programs apply different age or income eligibility requirements for their Medicaid expansion CHIP and separate CHIP programs. Similar to Medicaid, CHIP program expenditures are shared between the states and the federal government, but federal matching rates for CHIP are higher than for Medicaid and federal funding for CHIP is capped, with states receiving annual CHIP allotments. The type of CHIP program a state designs may affect the amount of federal funding available to that state in the event the state exhausts available CHIP funding for the year. A state with a Medicaid expansion CHIP program that exhausts available CHIP funding may apply Medicaid funds at the Medicaid matching rate to remaining expenses for enrolled children for that year. However, a state with a separate CHIP program that exhausts available funding would not have access to such funding. In general, states administer CHIP under broad federal requirements that permit flexibility in how they design their programs, including in the services they cover, their upper income eligibility limits, and the fees they charge to participate. In terms of income eligibility, as of January 2019, 19 states, including the District of Columbia, had CHIP upper income eligibility limits of 300 percent of the FPL or higher compared with 32 states whose CHIP upper income eligibility limits were below 300 percent of the FPL. (See fig. 1.) In addition, states can charge beneficiaries fees for CHIP coverage. These fees can vary depending on whether they are enrollment fees, premiums, or other types of cost sharing. Among the states that charge CHIP premiums, the premiums can vary based on family income and the number of children in CHIP. (See table 1.) Although states may charge premiums or have other cost sharing, according to CMS, CHIP provides more affordable coverage than is generally available in the private health insurance market. CHIP crowd-out may occur when employers modify or decide not to offer health insurance to their employees or to their dependents, because of CHIP availability. For example, employers who are aware of CHIP may decide not to offer health insurance to employees or their dependents due to concerns about the costs of providing insurance, especially for smaller sized firms, or as a result of changes in federal or state policies, such as requirements resulting from PPACA. Crowd-out may also occur when employees drop or decide not to enroll in insurance offered by their employers and enroll their children in CHIP, because of CHIP availability. As we have identified in prior work, assessments of the potential for crowd-out must take into account an understanding of the extent to which private health insurance is available and affordable to low-income families who qualify for CHIP. National survey results show that private health insurance is the most prevalent source of insurance for children; however, there is substantial variation across states in coverage rates. Additionally, the extent to which employers offered individuals insurance varies by family income. For additional information on factors that may affect crowd-out, see appendix I. For information on sources of health insurance for children under age 19, including CHIP and employer sponsored insurance, see appendix II. The type of CHIP program a state designs affects its responsibilities for monitoring and mitigating the potential for CHIP crowd-out. The 42 states with separate CHIP programs\u2014including those in combination CHIP states\u2014are required to submit CHIP plans that describe reasonable procedures to prevent crowd-out and to report annually to CMS on certain crowd-out related indicators, such as the number of CHIP applicants with access to private health insurance; however, CMS provides states flexibility to decide which crowd-out prevention procedures to use. For example, states can require CHIP applicants to undergo a period of uninsurance prior to enrollment, known as a waiting period, to deter families that have access to private health insurance from dropping that insurance to enroll in CHIP. In contrast, states are not required to take steps to prevent crowd-out for their Medicaid expansion CHIP programs and may only do so if consistent with the Medicaid statute, or if under an approved section 1115 demonstration, which allows states to implement policies that waive certain Medicaid requirements. For states with separate and combination CHIP programs, CMS provides general guidance for minimizing crowd-out, which the agency has modified over time. (See table 2 for a description of the crowd-out related responsibilities.) For example, in 2013, CMS issued regulations to align with a PPACA provision for health plans and health insurance issuers that limited waiting periods to a maximum of 90 days, and established mandatory waiting period exemptions. The regulations also eliminated the application of a CHIP policy requiring that states with separate CHIP programs have different crowd-out prevention procedures in place for children at different income levels. In making this change, CMS noted that available research called into question the prevalence of crowd-out. CMS indicated that its policy still required states to monitor crowd-out and, if a high rate of crowd-out were to occur, states should consider implementing prevention procedures, such as public outreach about other health care options available in the state. In response to crowd-out related recommendations we made in 2009, CMS modified its guidance to collect additional information from states in their 2009 through 2013 annual reports on how they assess the availability and affordability of private health insurance for CHIP applicants. For example, from 2009 through 2013, states were required to report to CMS if the state\u2019s CHIP application asked if applicants had access to private health insurance. Additionally, states that operated a waiting period without affordability exceptions were asked if the state collected data on the cost of health insurance for an individual or family. However, CMS officials stated that the agency eliminated the questions regarding affordability of private health insurance in 2013, as part of efforts to update the electronic system states use to submit their CHIP annual reports to reflect PPACA enrollment simplification and coordination requirements. CMS officials said some of the questions were duplicative of other state reporting requirements and other questions were deemed irrelevant in light of the establishment of affordability exceptions to waiting periods. States reported indicators of potential crowd-out to CMS in their annual reports, although some do not report on these indicators and those that do may calculate them differently. The states also varied in the extent to which they have processes for directly estimating crowd-out; however, CMS officials and officials in selected states told us they understand the occurrence of crowd-out to be low. Further, we identified few published research studies that directly estimated crowd-out; each used different methodologies, resulting in varied estimates. States with separate CHIP programs\u2014including those in combination states\u2014are required to annually report indicators of potential crowd-out; states must also describe in their CHIP plans other indicators of potential crowd-out they collect. CMS\u2019s 2017 CHIP annual report asks these states to report on crowd-out related questions, including two indicators of crowd-out: (1) the percentage of individuals who enrolled in CHIP that have access to private health insurance, and (2) the percentage of CHIP applicants who cannot be enrolled, because they have private health insurance\u2014an indicator of potential crowd-out averted. However, not all states with separate CHIP programs track and report information related to these two indicators of potential crowd-out, and those that do may calculate these indicators differently. For example, of the 42 states with separate CHIP programs, the 2017 annual reports showed the following: Four of the 42 states reported that they tracked the number of individuals who have access to private health insurance; the remaining 38 states either did not report tracking this information or did not respond to this question. Of the four states tracking this information, the percentages reported ranged between 0.5 percent and 7 percent of CHIP applicants who have access to private health insurance. Twenty-one of the 42 states reported that they tracked the percentage of applicants who could not be enrolled in CHIP because they were enrolled in private health insurance; the remaining 21 states did not report this percentage to CMS. This is a measure of crowd-out averted due to state oversight of its enrollment process. The percentages reported by the 21 states tracking this information ranged from 0 percent in several states to 18 percent in one state. Among the states that reported they do not track individuals with access to private insurance and did not provide a percentage of applicants not enrolled in CHIP because of enrollment in private health insurance, five states indicated that either their electronic eligibility systems did not allow them to capture this information or the data to report this information were not available. CMS officials acknowledged that not all states report on these indicators; however, they noted that states operating separate CHIPs have other processes in place to prevent children with other health insurance from enrolling in CHIP. Further, some states that operate separate CHIP programs describe approaches for directly estimating crowd-out in their CHIP plan amendments. The results of these estimates are not reported to CMS unless they reach a threshold defined by each state. In 2013, CMS required separate CHIP states to submit state plan amendments to CMS to update their eligibility-related policies, including their crowd-out prevention procedures. In response, 17 of the 42 states submitted these amendments and described approaches they would use to directly measure crowd-out. For example: Colorado reported conducting a biennial survey to estimate the percentage of enrollees who dropped group health insurance without good cause to gain eligibility for CHIP, according to its CHIP plan. Connecticut reported comparing the number of children denied CHIP enrollment because they were enrolled in private health insurance to those same applicants who reapplied for CHIP 6 months later, but did not have private health insurance. The crowd-out threshold defined by Colorado and Connecticut is 10 percent; therefore, if these states\u2019 crowd-out estimates were to exceed 10 percent, each state would collaborate with CMS to identify other procedures to reduce crowd-out. According to CMS officials, no state using this approach to estimate crowd-out has exceeded the percentages established or expressed concerns with crowd-out. States we interviewed varied in the extent to which they estimate crowd- out; however, most states did not view crowd-out to be of concern. Among our six selected states with separate CHIP programs, one state\u2014 New York\u2014directly measures crowd-out. New York asks applicants that dropped their private insurance in the last three months the reasons why they dropped this coverage, which includes responses such as the family\u2019s preference for the child to have CHIP benefits over their previously held private health insurance. New York state officials told us they consider instances of crowd-out to include when individuals drop private insurance because CHIP costs and benefits are more favorable. For the last 9 months of 2014, the officials estimated crowd-out in New York to be about 1.9 percent. If New York estimates crowd-out to be higher than 8 percent, state officials told us they will report this to CMS and work with CMS on implementing additional crowd-out prevention procedures. Officials from the other five selected states said they do not actively measure crowd-out, some of them citing limited resources and difficulties developing estimates, and noted that crowd-out was not a high priority for them, because they did not think crowd-out was prevalent in their states. For example, officials from two states said they had not heard any concerns regarding crowd-out from their state legislature, state insurance agencies, or others. CMS officials also told us that no state had reported concerns about crowd-out. Our review identified few research studies that directly estimated CHIP crowd-out. Specifically, we identified three research studies published from 2013 to 2018; each used different methods and arrived at varying estimates of crowd out. One study estimated crowd-out across 15 states that expanded their CHIP income eligibility requirements between 2008 and 2012 by examining health insurance enrollment changes in a sample of children after they became newly eligible for CHIP. This study estimated that public insurance among children under age 19 increased about 2.9 percentage points during this period, and private insurance decreased by 1.8 percentage points. The study reported that 63 percent of the 2.9 percentage point increase in public insurance was due to crowd-out. The researchers also produced state-level estimates for the effects of CHIP income eligibility expansions on insurance coverage in newly eligible children. These estimates varied by state, suggesting that crowd-out also varies by state. In particular, three states had an increase in public insurance ranging from about 4 to 12 percentage points, and three states had a decrease in private insurance that ranged from about 7 to 14 percentage points. The researchers noted they did not account for factors that may have caused privately insured individuals to increase their use of public insurance, such as changes in the affordability of private health insurance. Another study estimated the effect of CHIP income eligibility expansions on crowd-out in Illinois. This study examined the differences in public and private health insurance between children in Illinois, where CHIP income eligibility was expanded, and children from a combination of other states that did not expand CHIP\u2014and were chosen to resemble the demographic characteristics and health insurance profile of Illinois. This study found a 6.5 percentage point increase in CHIP enrollment in 2010 among families between 200 percent and 300 percent of the FPL, and estimated that 35 percent of this increase in CHIP enrollment was due to crowd-out. At other income levels higher than 300 percent of the FPL, the study found either no net effect on private health insurance, or an increase. The third study estimated public and private insurance under different CHIP income eligibility thresholds and different premium schedules. While the study estimated that a CHIP expansion from 200 to 400 percent of the FPL with no premium contribution and a 4 month waiting period increased CHIP enrollment by about 4.5 percentage points and decreased private coverage by about 2.2 percentage points, these estimates do not provide evidence of crowd-out, because the differences in these percentage point estimates were not statistically significant. Although not reporting direct estimates of CHIP crowd-out, we identified other studies that provide related information. For example: In one study, researchers surveyed the parents of current and former CHIP enrollees in 10 states to examine access to private coverage for children enrolled in CHIP. This study found that about 13 percent of new CHIP enrollees had private health insurance in the year before enrolling in CHIP. Among the 13 percent, about 18 percent reported that they dropped their private health insurance, because CHIP was more affordable, and about 5 percent dropped their private health insurance, due to a preference for CHIP. The authors noted that access to private coverage among CHIP enrollees is low and when access is available, affordability is a serious concern for parents. The authors concluded that this suggests limited potential for crowd-out. A study published in 2015 that surveyed the parents of about 4,100 new CHIP enrollees to understand why children enrolled in CHIP, among other things, found that 35 percent of these parents reported applying for CHIP, because it was more affordable than the other health insurance options they could obtain for their children. Representatives from national organizations, researchers, and CMS officials we interviewed noted some of the challenges measuring the extent of CHIP crowd-out, including the limitations of available data sources; however, they did not consider crowd-out to be prevalent. For example: Some data sources do not separately collect or categorize CHIP information. For example, the ACS does not specifically ask respondents if their children have health insurance through CHIP; thus, researchers have to manipulate the data to separate CHIP coverage from other forms of public health insurance, such as Medicaid. The methodologies available to separate CHIP from Medicaid respondents have many limitations, according to researchers and U.S. Census Bureau officials we contacted. Accurate crowd-out estimates require researchers to account for the reasons why someone dropped his or her health insurance and enrolled in CHIP, and this information is not captured by national surveys. Researchers may also vary in what they consider to be crowd-out; for example, some may not consider dropping private health insurance and enrolling a child in CHIP because of a job loss or change in employment to constitute crowd-out. Others do not consider it to be CHIP crowd-out when parents drop their private health insurance and enroll in CHIP, because CHIP is more affordable. CMS officials also noted complexities in measuring crowd-out\u2014such as variation in definitions of crowd-out and methodologies for measuring it\u2014and they said that the agency has not conducted or commissioned its own evaluation. However, CMS officials reiterated that no state has reported concerns with crowd-out and based on their review of studies conducted by researchers understand that its prevalence is likely low. CMS monitors states\u2019 CHIP crowd-out prevention procedures and offers technical assistance, while states ask CHIP applicants about other sources of health care coverage, and use waiting periods and cost- sharing procedures, such as enrollment fees and premiums. Several state officials we interviewed told us that their crowd-out prevention procedures are effective; however, they could not speak to the effectiveness of any particular procedure and few studies have examined the issue. CMS officials told us that they track the information states submit about their CHIP crowd-out prevention procedures as part of their annual report review process to identify any inconsistencies between the information contained in their state plans and the information submitted in states\u2019 annual reports, among other reasons. When CMS officials identify any noticeable differences in the information reported by states from year-to- year in the annual reports\u2014such as the percentage of CHIP applicants with access to private insurance\u2014they told us they follow-up with the state to obtain additional information about these differences, and, if needed, advise states on ways they can prevent crowd-out. CMS officials also told us they provide technical assistance, when requested, to assist states in developing crowd-out prevention procedures. For example, CMS officials said they provided states with technical assistance after issuing regulations in 2013 on the use of waiting periods that also required states to update their state plan amendments. CMS officials said they have no plans to develop additional strategies for collecting states\u2019 crowd-out information, because states have not reported crowd-out to be a concern, and there is no need to re-examine states\u2019 oversight if prevalence as measured in research is likely low. All 42 states with separate CHIP programs reported to CMS that they had implemented at least one of the following six types of procedures to prevent crowd-out: (1) asking about other health insurance and denying CHIP coverage if other sources of health insurance are identified; (2) implementing cost sharing for CHIP coverage; (3) conducting database checks for other health insurance; (4) implementing a waiting period for CHIP coverage; (5) measuring crowd-out and taking steps if certain thresholds are exceeded; and (6) offering premium assistance for private health insurance. The majority of these states (36 of the 42 states with separate CHIP programs) implemented at least three crowd-out procedures. All 42 states with separate CHIP programs asked applicants about other insurance coverage on their CHIP applications to deny applicants CHIP coverage if private insurance coverage was found, and CMS officials told us that 35 of those states required CHIP enrollees to pay premiums or make other financial contributions to the cost of the coverage. (See table 3.) Among our six selected states with separate CHIP programs, there were differences in how some crowd-out procedures were implemented. For example, three states conducted database checks to see if applicants had other sources of health insurance; however, one state checked prior to enrollment, another checked at enrollment and during application renewal, and one state ran weekly checks. Among our six selected states with separate CHIP programs, none planned to change procedures to prevent potential crowd-out. Among the 42 states with separate CHIP programs, some crowd-out prevention procedures vary or have changed over time. For example, while many states use a private company to collect state and national health insurance coverage information to conduct database checks, another state developed a database that contains information on insurance coverage available through over 40,000 employers in the state. Additionally, prior to 2014, 36 states imposed waiting periods, during which applicants could not have health insurance for a specified time before CHIP enrollment, to prevent crowd-out. In 2017, 14 states used waiting periods. Prior to PPACA and the implementation of CMS regulations that limited waiting periods to 90 days, waiting periods could range from 1 to 12 months. After CMS updated its regulation, 21 states eliminated their waiting periods and five states shortened them. Among our four selected states with separate CHIP programs that shortened or eliminated their waiting periods, none of the state officials expressed concerns that this change contributed to CHIP crowd-out. Administering a waiting period may involve the state tracking or determining whether the applicant meets any of the state and federal waiting period exemptions, the number of months for the waiting period before the applicant can be enrolled in CHIP, and informing the federally facilitated exchange if an exemption to the waiting period applies to the applicant. As a result, some officials noted that reducing waiting periods eased their state\u2019s administrative burdens, as well as eliminated gaps in children\u2019s health insurance. Among the four selected states, officials from New York said they eliminated their waiting periods because, after undergoing the various administrative steps to verify each application and apply the waiting period, the majority of the CHIP applicants met at least one waiting period exemption. However, three of the selected states with separate CHIP programs maintained waiting periods, and state officials from Texas told us that few individuals met the waiting period exemptions. Some state officials told us they attributed waiting periods\u2014which require children to go uninsured for a period of time\u2014to gaps in health care, and their states eliminated the waiting period in an attempt to provide continuity in children\u2019s access to health care. Although not required by law, officials from two of our selected states with Medicaid expansion CHIP programs told us their states previously had approved 1115 demonstration waivers permitting their states to use a CHIP waiting period, but eliminated them in 2013 and 2014 to close gaps in children\u2019s health insurance coverage. Currently, these states use similar procedures as separate CHIP states to prevent crowd-out, according to state officials. Of our three selected states with Medicaid expansion CHIP programs, one state monitors CHIP enrollment trends; a second state requires its managed care organizations to check CHIP enrollees for other sources of insurance as part of their claim processing activities; and one state conducts database checks for other health insurance at the time of enrollment and re-enrollment. The effect of some of the states\u2019 procedures on preventing CHIP crowd- out is unclear and, according to selected state officials and stakeholders, some crowd-out prevention procedures may have unintended consequences. For example, state officials and stakeholders told us waiting periods result in coverage gaps, which, as one stakeholder noted, could be catastrophic for a family with a sick child who would not have coverage during the waiting period. Several CHIP officials we interviewed believed their procedures are effective in preventing crowd- out; however, they either had not studied the effectiveness of their procedures or could not speak to the effectiveness of any particular procedure. Relatively few of the studies we reviewed examined the effectiveness of state procedures for preventing crowd-out. Specifically, two studies looked at this issue. Both studies concluded that cost-sharing procedures, such as premiums, can reduce the potential for crowd-out among higher- income CHIP-eligible families. A 2014 study used CHIP-related data from 2003 and found that CHIP premiums discourage individuals with private health insurance from dropping their insurance to enroll in CHIP. The study compared health insurance outcomes across 19 states for children with incomes slightly above states\u2019 CHIP income eligibility thresholds with children in families with incomes slightly below the thresholds. The results indicated that there is an association between CHIP premiums and private insurance coverage; that is, a $1 increase in the CHIP premium above the income cut-off is associated with a 2.2 percentage point higher probability of the child being privately insured for families within 15 percent of the upper income level, and a 1.7 percentage point higher probability for families within 25 percent of the upper income level. These findings suggest that private health insurance may be a preferable alternative for CHIP eligible families at higher income levels who face higher CHIP premiums. A 2013 study used survey data from 50 states and the District of Columbia from 2002 to 2009 to estimate the effect CHIP premium contributions have on enrollment in CHIP, private insurance, and rates of uninsurance among children in families with income eligibility levels of 200 to 400 percent of the FPL. The study found that if CHIP programs expand eligibility to those at higher income levels and charge those families a higher premium, the families may be more likely to choose private health insurance, nullifying the effects of CHIP expansion among higher income families.

GAO staff that made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. Crowd-out may occur when employers modify or decide not to offer health insurance to their employees or to their dependents because of Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) availability. For example, employers who are aware of CHIP may decide not to offer health insurance to employees due to concerns about the costs of providing insurance, especially for smaller sized firms, or as a result of changes in federal or state policies, such as requirements resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). For example, PPACA required employers with a certain number of employees to offer their full-time employees a health insurance option meeting certain criteria, including affordability, or face tax penalties. Some researchers and policymakers expressed concern that this requirement may encourage employers to change how they offer insurance to employees, such as no longer offering family and dependent coverage, instead only offering health insurance to the employees, thereby causing employees with children to seek public insurance or insurance through health insurance exchanges. Other researchers and organizations point to PPACA increasing the availability of private health insurance offered by employers and through health insurance exchanges, particularly in areas and among populations where employer sponsored health insurance may not be as readily available. Crowd-out may also occur when employees drop or decide not to enroll in insurance offered by their employers and enroll their children in CHIP because of CHIP availability; however, as we have reported in the past, assessments of crowd-out should consider the affordability and availability of the employer sponsored insurance. For example, families with access to employer sponsored insurance may find CHIP more affordable or find CHIP benefits more comprehensive than employer sponsored insurance. Alternatively, they may find that CHIP provides better access to services specific to their child\u2019s health care needs. For example, an evaluation of CHIP published in 2014 found that CHIP enrollees had better access to dental benefits than children with private insurance, although they were less likely to have a regular source of medical care and nighttime or weekend access to a provider. As we have identified in prior work, assessments of the potential for crowd-out must take into account an understanding of the extent to which private health insurance is available and affordable to low-income families who qualify for CHIP. American Community Survey (ACS) data showed that for 2013 through 2017, the most prevalent source of insurance for children in the United States under the age of 19 was private health insurance available through a parent\u2019s employer or union. (See fig. 2.) Although private health insurance is the most prevalent source of insurance for children, there is substantial variation across states in coverage rates. (See fig. 3.) For example, in eight states, fewer than 40 percent of children were insured through an employer in 2017. In contrast, in Utah, more than 60 percent of families with children were insured by an employer in 2017. Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data show that the extent to which employers offered individuals insurance in 2013 through 2015 varied by family income. For example, MEPS Household Component data\u2014which includes information on whether individuals were offered insurance by their employers\u2014show that over 90 percent of families with incomes greater than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) were offered insurance by their employers from 2013 through 2015. The percentage of families offered insurance by their employers ranged from about 35 percent for families with incomes less than or equal to 138 percent of the FPL to about 85 percent for families with incomes above 300 and less than 400 percent of the FPL. (See fig. 4.) An Agency for Healthcare Research Quality (AHRQ) analysis of MEPS Insurance Component data\u2014which includes information on whether employers offered insurance to their employees and the cost of that insurance\u2014 shows that in 2017, 24.2 percent of small employers (less than 50 employees) with a predominately lower-wage workforce offered their employees health insurance compared with 57.6 percent for small employers with a higher-wage workforce. In contrast, in 2017, offer rates at larger employers\u2014that is, employers with more than 50 employees\u2014 was 94 percent for those with predominately lower-wage employees and 98.7 percent for large employers with predominately higher wage employees. With regard to affordability, the MEPS Insurance Component data show that average employee premium contributions for family coverage from 2013 through 2017 increased. Over this period, employees who work for employers with a predominantly lower-wage workforce\u2014that is, employers that paid 50 percent or more of their workforce $12 or less per hour\u2014contributed a larger amount and percentage of premiums to their employer-sponsored insurance than did employees who work for non- low-wage employers. (See fig. 5.) MEPS Insurance Component data also show that employees who work at establishments with a predominately lower-wage workforce enroll in insurance offered by their employers at a lower rate than employees of other establishments, though it is not known if this is due to affordability reasons. Finally, MEPS Insurance Component data show that the percentage of employees with deductibles and the amount of the deductibles have increased from 2004 to 2017. Between 2013 and 2017, average family deductibles increased about 36 percent, from $2,491 in 2013 to $3,396 in 2017. In addition, research published in 2018 on high deductible health insurance plans showed both increasing enrollment in these plans and that larger employers (1,000 or more employees) contributed more toward health insurance premiums for these plans than smaller employers (less than 25 employees). For example, according to this study: From 2006 to 2016, there was a 35 percentage point increase (11.4 percent to 46.5 percent) in enrollees in high-deductible health plans, with enrollees from smaller employers more likely to be enrolled in these plans compared with enrollees from larger employers (56.4 percent of enrollees from small firms compared with 42 percent of enrollees from large firms). A lower percentage of enrollees from the smaller firms had a plan with an employer-funded account, which defray health care costs, compared with enrollees from larger firms. For example, in 2016, only about one-third of enrollees in high-deductible health insurance plans from the smallest employers had an employer funded account to help pay for medical expenses compared with 89.3 percent of enrollees from the largest employers. High-deductible health insurance plan enrollees of the smallest employers were also more likely to not have the choice of an alternative plan type compared with enrollees from the largest employers. Although private health insurance is the most prevalent source of insurance for children, there is substantial variation across states in coverage rates.

      "summary": "CHIP is a public insurance program established in 1997 that finances health care for over 9 million low-income children whose household incomes do not qualify them for Medicaid. States have flexibility in structuring their CHIP programs under broad federal requirements, and their income eligibility limits vary. Policymakers have had concerns that some states' inclusion of children from families with higher income levels could result in some families substituting CHIP for private insurance (i.e., crowd-out). Crowd-out may occur when, because of CHIP availability, (1) employers make decisions about offering health insurance; or (2) employees make decisions about enrolling in employer-sponsored health insurance. GAO was asked to examine CHIP crowd-out. This report describes (1) the information on potential indicators of crowd-out reported by states and estimates of crowd-out; and (2) the procedures CMS and states use to address potential crowd-out. GAO reviewed federal laws and guidance and state CHIP documentation, including their 2017 annual reports (the latest available at the time of GAO's review); conducted a literature review of studies published between 2013 and 2018; and interviewed CMS officials, stakeholders from national health policy organizations, and researchers. GAO also interviewed a non-generalizable selection of officials from nine states chosen to obtain variation in CHIP programs, such as income eligibility levels and geography. HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Limited information exists about Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) crowd-out\u2014that is, substituting CHIP for private health insurance. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), asked the 42 states that have separate CHIP programs to report on two crowd-out indicators for the 2017 annual reports: (1) the percentage of individuals who are enrolled in CHIP that have access to private health insurance and (2) the percentage of CHIP applicants who cannot be enrolled because they have private health insurance. The 2017 reports showed that: 4 states reported 0.5 percent to 7 percent of CHIP applicants had access to private health insurance; and 21 states reported denying CHIP enrollment to 0 percent to 18 percent of applicants because they had private insurance. Not all of these 42 states reported on these indicators and GAO found that those that do may calculate them differently. CMS officials acknowledged that not all states report on these indicators; however, they noted that states operating separate CHIPs have other processes in place to prevent children with other health insurance from enrolling in CHIP. Further, some states may have other processes for directly measuring CHIP crowd-out. GAO also identified three studies published between 2013 and 2018 that estimated CHIP crowd-out. However, these studies used different methods to calculate crowd-out, and as a result produced varied estimates. For example, one study attributed a portion of increased enrollment in CHIP and other public insurance to crowd-out, while another study found no evidence of crowd-out. According to CMS's 2017 annual reports and other information, the 42 states with separate CHIP programs reported implementing at least one of six types of crowd-out prevention procedures.

      "document": "The EDA program is one of several programs designed to build partner capacity through the provision of excess defense equipment and services to foreign governments or international organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These excess items are provided as part of U.S. security assistance efforts and help to support U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. The Foreign Assistance Act permits the transfer of excess defense articles provided that such transfers will not adversely affect the industrial base. In particular, under the Act, transfers must not reduce the opportunity for U.S. contractors to sell new or used defense equipment to countries requesting the transfer. Excess defense items can include aircraft, ammunition, clothing, radios, trucks, and spare parts. According to DOD officials, the vast majority of EDA items are low- to medium-level technologies that, if not transferred, would either be stored at cost to DOD or destroyed. Excess defense items can be transferred as grants\u2014as permitted by the Foreign Assistance Act\u2014or sold to eligible foreign governments at a reduced cost in \u201cas is, where is\u201d condition pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act. This means that the requesting foreign government is generally required to pay all repair or refurbishment costs, as well as all costs associated with transporting the EDA item\u2014which can be located in the United States or outside the continental United States. As previously mentioned, for purposes of this report, transfers refer to grants of EDA items unless otherwise indicated. DSCA has overall responsibility for administering the EDA program. The Director of DSCA has been delegated authority to make the determination on whether a proposed transfer could adversely affect the industrial base. The military departments determine when defense items are no longer needed and can designate them as excess and, upon approval, can offer them as EDAs. Multiple federal entities play a role in the EDA program, as illustrated in figure 1. Following the interagency coordination, if DSCA determines the proposed transfer will not adversely affect industry and thus can proceed, DSCA notifies Congress about proposed transfers that are valued at over $7 million or that contain significant military equipment. As part of the congressional notification, DSCA provides information on (1) the purpose for which the item is being provided to the country, (2) whether the item has been previously provided to the country, (3) the current value and original acquisition value of the item, and (4) its findings regarding how industry will be affected by the proposed transfer. After a 30-day congressional notification period, DSCA authorizes the proposed transfer in consultation with State, provided that Congress does not object and all agencies concur with the transfer. DSCA follows the same process to review and approve all proposed EDA transfers\u2014including for excess Humvees. One unique difference for Humvee transfers is a 2018 legislative requirement that Humvees be modernized with an armored or armor-capable crew compartment and a new modernized powertrain prior to a transfer, unless a waiver is granted. Humvees, which are four-wheel drive military light trucks, have been part of DOD\u2019s light tactical wheeled vehicle fleet since the 1980s. While the Army is the program office for Humvees, the vehicles have been used by other military departments in support of their own combat operations. Humvees were initially fielded to serve as a light, highly mobile and unarmored vehicle and are commonly used for combat operations; however, the Army National Guard also procures these vehicles for use in homeland defense and natural disaster relief operations. In efforts to adapt the Humvee to modern requirements for combat operations, the Army has increased the performance and protection of the vehicle over time. Over the past 30 years, AM General has produced three models\u2014the M900, M1000, and M1100 series. The company no longer produces the M900 and M1000 series for combat operations and certain parts and components that are unique to these vehicles are obsolete or otherwise not readily available. The M1100 series, which is still in production and supports combat operations and many non-combat related operational and support missions, offers newer capabilities such as increased weight capacity. With the additional weight capacity, the 1100 series is the only model that can support the added armor requirements under the new legislative requirement without a substantial overhaul. Figure 2 highlights some of the capabilities of the different Humvee models. DOD\u2019s light tactical wheeled vehicle strategy has changed since 2010, following lessons learned from military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. DOD plans to shift from procuring new Humvees to sustaining existing vehicles in its fleet. In its 2014 Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Strategy, the Army stated plans to buy fewer new Humvees because the vehicle no longer fully meets its evolving mobility or protection requirements. While DOD decreased its procurement of Humvees for military operations, it has plans to upgrade and refurbish existing vehicles. There are nearly 300,000 Humvees or vehicles with the Humvee chassis operating globally by the U.S. military and other foreign governments. These vehicles are expected to require ongoing maintenance and upgrades for the next 20 to 30 years. DOD routinely conducts industrial base risk assessments to gain insight on the viability of current suppliers to meet its current and future requirements. The assessment takes into account a range of considerations including (1) factors that could cause a current supplier to go out of business or exit the market and (2) the extent to which an existing supplier relies on DOD, foreign military sales, or commercial sales. While these assessments are not routinely conducted as part of the excess defense article (EDA) transfer process, they may be undertaken to provide input on EDA transfers, as needed. The Army has efforts underway to acquire a new vehicle\u2014the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV)\u2014to meet its future requirements. Although a different manufacturer was awarded the JLTV contract, in its industrial base risk assessment for this requirement, the Army stated it intends to maintain two manufacturers\u2014including AM General\u2014to meet its ongoing needs for light tactical wheeled vehicles. In a 2018 congressional briefing, the Army\u2019s Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology Command estimated maintaining a relatively even mix of both vehicles\u201454,810 Humvees from existing inventory and 49,099 new JLTVs\u2014to sustain operations for the foreseeable future. However, the Army is conducting a more comprehensive review of its light tactical vehicle requirements and plans to release its findings in an updated acquisition strategy expected in 2022. DOD approved nearly half of the total Humvees requested by foreign governments for fiscal years 2012 through 2018. The requests were in support of foreign governments\u2019 security efforts, such as counterterrorism. However, the number that was actually delivered was less than those approved because DOD decreased the number or foreign governments canceled their requests for various reasons. DSCA halted approvals of EDA Humvee requests since the start of fiscal year 2017 and raised concerns about the new statutory requirement to modernize Humvees prior to transfer. DOD approved nearly half of the total Humvees requested by foreign governments for fiscal years 2012 through 2018\u20147,612 vehicles of the 16,005 excess Humvees requested\u2014but has not approved Humvee requests made since the start of fiscal year 2017. Figure 3 shows the number of Humvees requested and approved for transfer each fiscal year. In our analysis of data provided by the Army and DSCA, we found from fiscal years 2012 through 2018, that 23 countries submitted requests for Humvees, including some requests in fiscal year 2018. The delivery of EDA items under the Foreign Assistance Act to certain countries is given priority to the maximum extent feasible. These countries include certain NATO countries, major non-NATO allies in the Middle East and Africa regions, and the Philippines. We found that the Middle East and Africa regions accounted for 75 percent of the vehicles requested over this period. Figure 4 shows the regional distribution of requests. The majority of requests for Humvees from countries in the Middle East and Africa regions were primarily to support various security-related missions. For example, one country requested excess Humvees for border security, counter smuggling, and counterterrorism operations. Such security-related efforts by foreign countries align with the U.S. 2018 National Defense Strategy, which states DOD\u2019s objective to prevent terrorism globally and aid U.S. foreign partners in their counter-terrorism efforts. Additionally, the strategy aims to strengthen alliances and attract new partners by increasing interoperability to work together and effectively achieve military objectives. DSCA is required to state the comparative foreign policy benefits that the United States would gain from a grant transfer rather than a sale when it notifies Congress about a proposed transfer. In the documents we reviewed, DSCA cited foreign policy benefits such as increasing the capability of countries to take on a greater share of military operations, supporting joint operations with NATO, or counterterrorism and counter- narcotics operations. For example, for one request, DSCA determined that a requested transfer was in the U.S. national interest, as equipping the foreign country\u2019s armed forces with Humvees would allow them to have an increased role in military operations in the Africa region. In turn, this would reduce the country\u2019s reliance on U.S. forces for NATO operations. In addition to requesting vehicles for security-related operations, some countries planned to use vehicles for spare parts or had plans to refurbish the vehicles on their own. We found that about two-thirds of the Humvees delivered through the EDA program from fiscal years 2012 through 2018 were older models\u2014either M900 or M1000 series\u2014rather than the newer M1100 series. Most countries receiving deliveries of older models were seeking to replace existing vehicles in their fleet or to use EDA Humvees for spare parts. As previously mentioned in this report, DSCA has not approved any EDA Humvee requests since the start of fiscal year 2017. One reason, according to our analysis of DSCA data, is the manufacturer\u2019s objections to proposed transfers. Another is because of the legislative provision in the Fiscal Year 2018 NDAA that requires Humvees to be modernized with an armored or armor-capable crew compartment and new, modernized powertrain prior to transferring. The corresponding conference report stated the conferees\u2019 expectation that any modernization and refurbishment work must generally be done at no cost to DOD. According to DOD, the cost to modernize would be incurred by the requesting foreign government. Since the provision\u2019s enactment, DOD has not exercised the authority to waive this legislative requirement for any Humvee request. Foreign governments have not been willing to pay for the modernization, so approvals have halted. Since the enactment of the modernization requirement in December 2017, DSCA has received requests for 4,103 Humvees. According to DSCA officials, when a foreign government submits a letter of request for EDA Humvees, DSCA notifies the country of the modernization requirement and its responsibility to pay for the cost to refurbish the vehicles in accordance with the law. In DOD documents we reviewed, foreign governments cited having limited budgets and being financially unable to purchase defense equipment such as Humvees. As such, they rely on the EDA program to acquire defense items. DSCA officials told us that the modernization work is to be done at no cost to the U.S. government; however, they added that paying the cost to modernize Humvees can be cost-prohibitive for foreign governments. Foreign governments can request, through DSCA, that the modernization requirement be waived. Since December 2017, according to DSCA officials, DSCA has received waiver requests from three foreign governments but has not exercised the waiver authority. According to DSCA officials, these requests likely will remain unapproved for the foreseeable future; however, the provision requiring the refurbishment of excess Humvees prior to transfer is set to expire in December 2020. According to DSCA officials, DSCA plans to resume its normal EDA approval process thereafter. Currently, according to DSCA officials, they are encouraging foreign governments to look at other options to meet their fleet requirements, including purchasing new Humvees. However, DSCA officials acknowledge that, if a foreign government cannot afford to buy new vehicles, DOD does not have any low-cost vehicles to offer as an alternative solution. However, DOD officials and Army documents we reviewed noted that even if foreign governments were able to independently fund the modernization costs, there are not sufficient quantities of the newer model Humvees\u2014M1100 series\u2014in inventory that can support the additional weight of the added armored capabilities for the modernized crew compartment. According to DSCA documentation, the EDA program has a little over a hundred vehicles that could be refurbished to the modernization requirements. Additionally, most of the Humvees in DOD\u2019s inventory are older models that would first require a new expanded vehicle chassis to withstand the weight of adding armor. The officials likened the modernization process for the older model Humvees to essentially building a whole new vehicle. DSCA\u2019s determinations of whether there is an adverse industrial base effect to approve Humvee transfers are largely based on objections from the manufacturer about the proposed transfers. Since 2015, the Humvee manufacturer has objected more frequently to the transfer of vehicles to foreign governments. In all but one instance when the manufacturer objected to a transfer, we found that DSCA and BIS took steps to address concerns of the Humvee manufacturer and reach a resolution, such as providing the manufacturer Humvee refurbishment work. DSCA\u2019s decision on whether there is an adverse industrial base effect to approve a transfer of Humvees is largely based on the manufacturer\u2019s perspective on a proposed transfer. DSCA has considerable latitude for such decisions as the Foreign Assistance Act, as delegated, does not specify how determinations should be made on whether proposed transfers could adversely affect U.S. industries. Historically, DSCA has sought input from BIS to aid its determination about potential industrial base effects of proposed transfers. According to DSCA officials, all proposed EDA Humvee transfers have undergone an assessment of adverse industrial base effect by BIS. We found that BIS actively engages the Humvee manufacturer on proposed transfer requests and supported all but one objection from fiscal years 2012 through 2018. BIS\u2019s standard practice is to collect information from the prime contractor and other suppliers to inform its recommendation to DSCA about possible industrial base effects. As part of its efforts regarding proposed Humvee transfers, BIS notified AM General and provided information on all the transfer requests including the requesting country; number of vehicles requested; the vehicle model; and the country\u2019s plans, if known, to repair or upgrade EDA vehicles, including who the country intends to select for such work. BIS officials told us that they request a response within 7 calendar days on whether the manufacturer supports or objects to the proposed transfer. In instances where the Humvee manufacturer objected to a transfer, BIS required that the manufacturer provide an explanation of its objection. In documents we reviewed, the manufacturer objected for various reasons, including that a transfer would: (1) directly interfere with ongoing marketing or planned sales to the requesting country, or (2) adversely affect its business and that of its suppliers. BIS\u2019s standard procedure is to request proof of ongoing sales efforts if a company states that a proposed transfer will interfere with potential sales. In the cases where the Humvee manufacturer cited ongoing or planned business development with a requesting country, BIS required that the manufacturer provide information of its ongoing efforts to sell its vehicles to the requesting country, including: documentation of recent or planned meetings with foreign government officials and a timeline of the meetings; export licenses; and business plans. If a manufacturer submits an objection, BIS will also check if they have registered business activity with Commerce\u2019s Advocacy Center, which provides assistance to defense companies pursuing contracts with overseas governments and government agencies. If BIS concludes the Humvee manufacturer has a basis for its objection due to ongoing business with the requesting country, it will recommend that DSCA not authorize the transfer. According to DSCA officials, this is largely because it considers the possibility that the transfer could dissuade requesting foreign governments from purchasing new or used vehicles. Thus, providing vehicles through the EDA program at no cost or a discounted price to a foreign government could siphon potential business from the manufacturer or could compete with the manufacturer\u2019s sales efforts. Under the Foreign Assistance Act, a transfer request cannot be fulfilled if doing so will interfere with the manufacturer\u2019s ability to sell equipment to the requesting country. During fiscal years 2012 through 2018, we found only one instance where DSCA, based on BIS\u2019s recommendation, did not support AM General\u2019s objection. In that case\u2014a request for Humvees from Albania\u2014DSCA moved forward and approved a Humvee transfer because the manufacturer could not demonstrate ongoing business with the requesting country. AM General has objected more frequently to the transfer of vehicles to foreign governments since March 2015. In 2015, the JLTV production contract was awarded to another contractor and the Humvee manufacturer sold its commercial automotive plant, both of which occurred in the wake of decreasing or nonrecurring DOD Humvee procurements in comparison to past years. In total, the Humvee manufacturer has challenged 11 transfer requests for over 4,000 vehicles between fiscal years 2015 and 2018. The manufacturer told us that the increasing number of proposed transfers is concerning because the transfers amount to nearly 3 years\u2019 worth of new vehicles it could produce to sustain its production lines. AM General representatives told us they will continue to object to the transfer of older Humvee vehicles (M900 and M1000 models). For these models, the representatives citied concerns that parts for these vehicles are no longer in production, and thus the manufacturer cannot ensure qualified parts are available for maintenance and repairs. They are also concerned that older vehicles have the propensity to break down, which could damage the Humvee brand internationally\u2014particularly, if counterfeit parts are used. In our review of documents describing requesting countries\u2019 use of vehicles, we found that older model vehicles are, at times, accepted by foreign governments to use as spare parts to maintain an existing fleet and to develop their workforce\u2019s capability to repair vehicles. However, we found that since 2015, the majority of vehicles to which the manufacturer objected were the newer M1100 models\u2014stemming largely from a single 2016 request for Afghanistan. To support its objections to this transfer, AM General has stated that its own international sales are an important source of revenue, particularly because DOD has reduced its procurement of Humvees. AM General representatives explained that proposed transfers through the EDA program can threaten their company\u2019s potential future sales to foreign governments that may be less likely to purchase new Humvees if DSCA approves transfers of used vehicles. According to the manufacturer, each transfer is a potential one-for-one reduction of a possible sale of a new vehicle to the requesting country, which can affect its bottom line as well as the suppliers that provide parts and materials to produce the Humvees. In our review of Army procurement data, we found that many countries that requested excess Humvees have not purchased them through the FMS program from fiscal years 2012 through 2018. DSCA officials told us that most of the countries requesting Humvees through the EDA program find it cost-prohibitive to purchase new Humvee vehicles directly from the manufacturer. A new Humvee can cost between $115,000 and $190,000 depending on the model and capabilities included. As a result, these countries rely on EDA Humvees provided through grants to sustain their military fleets. Figure 5 shows the number of Humvees procured by DOD relative to the number of vehicles foreign governments bought through the FMS program and those they were granted via the EDA program. We found that from fiscal years 2012 to 2018 AM General\u2019s objections to proposed EDA Humvee transfers have increased the time that it takes for DSCA and BIS to review and make their determinations. If the manufacturer did not object to a transfer, which was largely the case prior to March 2015, BIS provided its recommendation to DSCA, on average, within 21 days. However, our analysis showed that an objection to a Humvee transfer on average added approximately 152 days to address industry objections. DSCA officials acknowledged that the approval process can be prolonged when the manufacturer objects to a proposed transfer, potentially contributing to longer waiting periods for requesting countries to receive the Humvees. In addition, the longer that vehicles remain in storage, the more likely it is that they will require more repairs to make them operational, resulting in increased costs to the requesting foreign governments to refurbish them, according to a DSCA official. Manufacturer representatives also told us they want to be involved earlier in the process to provide input on the potential effects of proposed transfers. We found that, on average, DSCA notifies BIS about 4 months after a country submits its Humvee request and BIS reaches out to the manufacturer a day or two later. A DSCA official explained that it can be a challenge to involve the manufacturer earlier because the request is not fully stable and could be revised for a number of reasons, including countries canceling the request or changing requirements to obtain different capabilities, and DOD internal policy considerations need to be vetted before reaching out to the manufacturer. In recent years, DSCA and BIS have taken steps to address AM General\u2019s increasing objections to proposed transfers. In 2018, BIS modified its approach to assess adverse effects of Humvee transfers to consider an additional factor. Now, BIS considers the cumulative effect and totality of previous EDA Humvee requests, in addition to assessing each request on a case-by-case basis. According to BIS officials, this was in response to the pattern of consistent objections that they were receiving from the Humvee manufacturer. AM General acknowledged that communication with DSCA and BIS about Humvee EDA transfers has improved. For example, DSCA notified AM General about its decision to sustain the company\u2019s objection and, thus, not move forward on a transfer request made in July 2019 for 2,000 vehicles. AM General told us that in the past, DSCA did not notify AM General about whether it had sustained or overruled the company\u2019s objection to a proposed transfer. AM General\u2019s objections to EDA Humvee transfers have at times led to additional business channels for the Humvee manufacturer. For example, we found that the manufacturer received business opportunities from EDA Humvee transfers to Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, and Thailand that included, providing long-term sustainment and refurbishment of Humvees, among other things. In response, the contractor withdrew over a third of its objections between fiscal years 2012 and 2018 based on receiving this type of work or reaching agreements with foreign governments to provide fully operational Humvees. The remaining transfers were cancelled; put on hold pending resolution with the Humvee manufacturer; or in one case, moved forward with an objection in place. The agreements to provide additional support can be financially beneficial to the manufacturer and help sustain its production capabilities. For example, we found that in 2012, the Humvee manufacturer objected to a country\u2019s transfer request of 250 vehicles, but withdrew their objection after reaching an agreement with the foreign government to perform much of the refurbishment work for those vehicles. In another case, we found that for the 2016 proposed transfer of 2,461 vehicles to support the Afghanistan National Security Force, the Humvee manufacturer objected, citing concerns about the large number of vehicles requested, among other concerns (see sidebar). The proposed transfer of EDA Humvees to Afghanistan was requested by DOD after a 2016 Senate report expressed concerns about a lack of insight into the cost-benefit analysis of procuring new equipment instead of refurbishing excess equipment. In response to the proposed transfer, the manufacturer sent a letter to BIS outlining their anticipated role in the Afghanistan transfer, including obtaining Army contracts to add armor kits to EDA vehicles, providing new powered chassis, and if required, new Humvees. The letter also noted the Humvee manufacturer\u2019s withdrawal of its objection to the transfer. DSCA subsequently notified the manufacturer that it did not agree with the terms AM General outlined in the letter to BIS and specified that the proposed transfer would create business opportunities for U.S. industry, including AM General, to refurbish EDA Humvees. DSCA also added that it would continue to ensure that industry is notified of all proposed Humvee EDA transfer requests so that industry can provide input or express concerns. According to DOD officials, the number of Humvees available for transfer to Afghanistan was reduced as DOD decided to split the number of available EDA Humvees in inventory at the time to meet requirements in Afghanistan and Iraq. In total, 1,644 vehicles were identified for transfer to Afghanistan. As part of this effort, according to information we received from the Army, AM General, and the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, the Humvee manufacturer was awarded a contract to provide armor kits for the 1,644 EDA Humvees being refurbished by the Army\u2019s Red River Depot. The manufacturer also provided other vehicle parts as part of the EDA transfer request for Afghanistan. According to DOD officials, it currently does not have plans to transfer additional vehicles to Afghanistan to fulfill the remaining EDA vehicles requested as part of the 2016 transfer request and will reevaluate future Afghanistan requirements, as needed. We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Commerce and Defense for review and comment. Both agencies provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. This report provides information about (1) DOD\u2019s approval of grant transfers of excess High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV)\u2014commonly pronounced Humvees\u2014 requested by foreign governments from fiscal years 2012 through 2018 and (2) how the Humvee manufacturer\u2019s perspectives on the proposed transfers have been addressed by DOD as part of the determination of any adverse industrial base effects. To provide information about DOD\u2019s approval of transfers of excess Humvees, we analyzed data for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 (the most recent available fiscal year at the time of our review) from the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). These data provided insight about the countries and geographic regions that have requested excess defense article (EDA) Humvees as well as the condition and types of vehicles delivered to foreign governments. We also reviewed documentation provided by requesting countries to identify the intended purpose of the request. We interviewed agency officials responsible for the data to identify the quality controls in place to help ensure the data are accurate and reliable. To assess the reliability of each data source, we compared the data in each DOD component\u2019s data sets to ensure that the information was complete and consistent. We did this by identifying common identifiers used for the Humvee EDA transfers that occurred within the designated 7-year period. According to DSCA officials, the DSCA EDA database is a consolidation of data provided annually by the military departments, and DLA, and is manually entered into the database by DSCA officials. Furthermore, we reviewed the data for issues such as missing data elements and duplicates, among other steps. Based on these steps taken, we determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting information about EDA Humvee transfer requests. See table 1 of DOD data sources used to track information on excess defense articles. To provide information about how the Humvee manufacturer\u2019s perspectives on the proposed transfers have been addressed by DOD as part of the determination of any adverse industrial base effects, we reviewed documents, data, and interviewed officials from DSCA and the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Commerce Department, that advises DSCA on industry effects of proposed EDA transfers. For purposes of this report, unless otherwise indicated, transfers refers to grants of EDA under the Foreign Assistance Act. We reviewed BIS policies and procedures related to the EDA program to identify the factors BIS considers in making adverse effect determinations. We also reviewed data generated by BIS to identify the extent to which the Humvee manufacturer objected to proposed transfers for the 7-year period included in our review. We also reviewed data provided by the Army on the number of Humvees procured for the Army\u2019s use and for vehicles sold to foreign governments through the Foreign Military Sales program from fiscal years 2012 through 2018. To gain insight about DSCA and BIS\u2019s approach to assess industrial base effects of proposed transfers, we selected two transfer requests as illustrative case studies: a 2016 transfer for Afghanistan which was the single largest proposed transfer and a 2016 transfer for Albania as it was the only proposed transfer that BIS did not sustain the manufacturer\u2019s objection. We also spoke with representatives from AM General to obtain their perspectives on the EDA program and gain insight about the effect of EDA transfers on their business. We conducted this performance audit from February 2019 to February 2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Marie A.

      "summary": "DOD can declare defense equipment as excess to U.S. military needs and make it available for transfer as a grant or sale to foreign governments. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes these transfers as grants provided that they do not adversely affect the U.S. national technology and industrial base, among other things. In this regard, transfers pursuant to the Act must not limit U.S. companies' ability to sell new or used defense equipment to countries requesting the transfer. The 2018 NDAA generally requires that Humvee transfers be modernized with a new powertrain and armor prior to being transferred. The Act also generally requires GAO to report on proposed and completed Humvee transfers and the process to determine if transfers will adversely affect the industrial base. This report provides information on (1) excess Humvees requested and approved during fiscal years 2012 through 2018 and (2) how the Humvee manufacturer's perspectives on the proposed transfers have been addressed by DOD as part of the determination of any adverse industrial base effects. GAO analyzed the latest DOD data on EDA Humvee transfers from fiscal years 2012 through 2018; reviewed DOD policies, guidance, and documents to gain insight into the process for determining industrial base effects of proposed transfers; and interviewed agency officials and Humvee manufacturer representatives. Excess High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV)\u2014commonly pronounced Humvees\u2014are among thousands of items that the Department of Defense (DOD) can transfer to foreign governments at their request through the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program. Twenty-three countries, primarily from the Middle East and Africa, requested 16,005 Humvees for the 7-year period GAO reviewed. DOD approves such requests if it determines: excess U.S. inventory is available at the time of the request, the request aligns with U.S. foreign policy objectives, such as using the vehicles to help combat terrorism, and the U.S. industrial base will not be adversely affected by the transfer. For example, DOD approved a country's request for excess Humvees for border security, counter-smuggling, and counter-terrorism efforts. DOD approved nearly half of the total Humvees requested for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 (see figure). However, DOD has halted further approvals since the start of fiscal year 2017 due to concerns expressed by the Humvee manufacturer and language in the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (2018 NDAA) and conference report that generally says Humvees must be modernized at no cost to DOD. GAO found that DOD considered the Humvee manufacturer's perspectives on proposed transfers and generally took steps to mitigate concerns about transfers that could siphon potential business from the manufacturer or compete with its sales efforts. Further, GAO found that generally, when the manufacturer objected to a transfer, the manufacturer withdrew its objection after receiving business opportunities to repair or upgrade vehicles for DOD or a requesting government's fleet. DOD officials also noted that most of the countries requesting Humvees through the EDA program find it cost-prohibitive to purchase new Humvees directly from the manufacturer. As a result, these countries rely on EDA Humvees to sustain their military fleets.",

      "document": "diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working - age persons around the world.1,2 it can be found in three out of four patients within 15 years of the diagnosis of diabetes.3,4 visual impairment is most commonly a consequence of diabetic macular edema ( dme).5,6 while vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors are usually used first for dme , intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide monotherapy ( ivta ) has also been proven to be efficacious for refractory dme and vision loss in eyes that fail laser therapy.1,7 it has been shown to improve vision and reduce central macular thickness ( cmt ) , with benefits persisting for up to 5 years.810 moreover , for patients with earlier dme , ivta followed by laser photocoagulation has been shown to double the chance of an improvement in vision by ten or more best - corrected logarithm of minimum angle of resolution letters at 2 years compared to laser alone.11 this result can be contrasted with the diabetic retinopathy clinical research network trial , which found that only the subset of eyes that were pseudophakic at baseline had better visual acuity outcomes after ivta combined with prompt laser treatment.12 the divergent findings may in part be due to differences in study protocol , ie , the shorter period of time between ivta and laser therapy in the diabetic retinopathy clinical research network study ( 310 days versus 6 weeks ) may not have allowed sufficient time for the edema to resolve before application of the laser.11,12 since patients often require more than one injection with ivta , they may be at higher risk of dose - dependent steroid - related adverse events , principally cataract and raised intraocular pressure ( iop).1315 this paper examines whether it is possible to predict from baseline characteristics the number of ivta injections patients will require once they embark on a course of combined therapy with laser photocoagulation . \n this analysis was based on data from the thunderbird ( a multicenter randomized clinical trial of laser treatment plus ivta for dme ) study , a prospective , randomized , double - masked , placebo - controlled trial.11,16 the thunderbird study tested the hypothesis that there is a synergistic effect of ivta and laser photocoagulation on vision improvement and reduction in macular thickness in eyes with dme . \n the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the research ethics committees of the four participating clinical centers . \n patients were included in the thunderbird study if they had focal or diffuse dme involving the central fovea with a cmt of greater than 250 m and best - corrected logarithm of minimum angle of resolution letters read ( ie , best - corrected visual acuity [ bcva ] ) in the affected eye(s ) of 1770 letters . \n time - domain optical coherence tomography was performed ( stratus oct ; carl zeiss meditec , jena , germany ) to determine the average thickness of the central macula ( 1 mm diameter ) . \n eyes were allocated either to ivta injection or sham -

masked , placebo - controlled clinical trial of eyes with dme , increasing baseline cmt was strongly linked with requiring more ivta plus laser treatments.11,16 eyes that eventually received more ivta plus laser during the 2 years of this study had significantly greater mean baseline cmt . in binary and multinomial logistic regression analyses , \n no relationship was found between other baseline characteristics ( bcva , age , gender , hba1c , phakia , and iop ) and the number of treatments received . \n the authors believe that the strong relationship found between a high baseline cmt and the need for ivta retreatment in the patients participating in the thunderbird study is representative of the routine clinical use of this drug . while the data were derived from a randomized controlled trial during which loss to follow up was low , the patients in the study that received a greater number of treatments did so because they met the retreatment criteria more frequently . \n these criteria were similar to those used in clinical practice , in which treatment is given at the clinician s discretion in light of findings from clinical examination and imaging . \n if a clinician has a patient similar to those included in this study and applies similar retreatment criteria , then baseline cmt can be used to predict how many treatments will be prescribed . \n this analysis is not equipped to determine why the eyes in this study with thicker maculas at baseline received more treatments than eyes with less swollen maculas . \n it can be inferred from the prospectively defined criteria that eyes that received multiple treatments were not responding as well to therapy . in this study , eyes were considered for reinjection plus laser 6 weeks later unless macular edema resolved , bcva improved , or laser photocoagulation was no longer considered appropriate . \n . it might be that eyes with more fluid require more therapy to dry out the macula , ie , a high cmt is representative of more severe retinal dysfunction which requires more treatments to stabilize.17 alternatively , in contrast to previous reports , it may be that dme is more likely to recur in eyes with a high baseline cmt.18 irrespective of the mechanisms underlying the current findings , the ability to predict which patients will require multiple treatments has important implications for the risk and benefit profile of treatment . \n the main side effects of ivta treatment are iop elevation and accelerated cataract formation , both of which are dose dependent . \n the risk of cataract formation and subsequent cataract surgery is strongly dose related.13,1921 similarly , it has been shown that the duration of ocular hypertension is longer with higher doses of ivta.14 the benefits to be gained from treatment in eyes with high baseline cmt should be balanced with the greater risk of developing adverse events . the major weakness of this retrospective analysis is the relatively small number of patients available for analysis . \n conversely , the strength of the relationship between cmt and the number of ivta plus laser treatments received should be viewed positively in light of the number of patients analyzed . \n the need for retreatment was not a prospectively defined outcome and the reasons for a decision to retreat or not were not collected from the investigators . \n future trials should assess these factors as the ability to predict the number of intravitreal therapies that will be required before embarking on a course of therapy would be highly beneficial to patient care . \n this would be equally applicable to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors , whose treatment regimen is more intense with less time between injections than that of ivta . \n in summary , this analysis assessed the predictive value of baseline characteristics of the number of ivta plus laser treatments needed to control dme in the first 2 years of a clinical trial . \n a high baseline cmt was shown to be strongly associated with receiving more ivta plus laser treatments . \n the practical implication of the findings of this study is that baseline cmt may be used as a factor when weighing up the risks and benefits of ivta treatment for dme . \n this may become an important measure in the clinical decision making of the treatment of this disease .",

      "document": "lesch - nyhan syndrome was first recognized and clinically characterized in 1964 by lesch and nyhan , observing two affected brothers . \n lns is a rare x - linked recessive disorder , resulting from a mutation on the gene encoding for the enzyme hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( hgprt ) , located on the long arm of the x chromosome between xq26 and xq27 . \n the hgprt is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism , which catalyses the condensation reaction which combines phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( prpp ) and the purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine to form the respective nucleotides , inosinic acid , and guanylin acid . \n the hgprt deficiency causes a backlog of guanine and hypoxanthine that oxidize in uric acid and an increase of intracellular prpp with a consequent major production of new purine . \n it results in an overproduction and accumulation of uric acid , which , if untreated , usually leads to renal failure and death in early childhood . \n one of the first symptoms of the disease is the presence of orange sand - like crystals of uric acid in the diapers of the affected infant . \n overproduction of uric acid may lead to the development of uric acid crystals or stones in the kidneys ( nephrolithiasis ) , ureters , or bladder , causing hematuria and increasing the risk of urinary tract infection , of nephrite , and of renal failure . \n another potential consequence of untreated hyperuricemia is gouty arthritis caused by uric acid crystal deposition in articular cartilage . \n the affected children appear to be normal for the first few months of life , but hypotonia and development delay are evident from age three to six months . \n later extrapyramidal involvement with dystonia , choreoathetosis , opisthotonos , dysarthria , dysphagia , and sometimes ballismus becomes evident . \n the patients also develop signs of pyramidal involvement as spasticity , hyperreflexia , and extensor plantar reflexes . \n the motor disability is so extensive that most individuals never walk and are confined to a wheelchair . \n the cognitive disturbs , attention deficit problems , and mental retardation are also present in patients with lesch - nyhan syndrome . \n the affected children appear normal for the first months of life ; with the eruption of deciduous teeth , they begin to show self - mutilative behavior , biting their oral / perioral tissue and their fingers . \n the finger nails may be completely ripped , and the self - destructive process involves the bone . in some cases , extensive lesions \n the secondary infection complicates and retards the healing of traumatic lesions [ 4 , 5 ] . \n nyhan ( 1997 ) reported that children with lns feel pain and remorse when they mutilate themselves , but they are unable to control and to stop their action . \n they are usually relaxed when they have physical restraints , instead when it is removed the patients become agitated and their compulsive actions increase . \n the relationship between the enzyme deficiency and the neurological manifestations in lesch - nyhan syndrome is not so clear . \n those disorders may be associated with deficits in dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia ; neurochemical studies of lns patients ' brains show large reductions in da levels , elevated numbers of da receptors , and decreased levels of da transporters . the therapy with allopurinol , a xanthine oxidase inhibitor which blocks the metabolism of hypoxanthine and xanthine into uric acid , can control the overproduction of uric acid , reducing the risk of nephrolithiasis , gouty arthritis , and correlated diseases . \n the dose of allopurinol has to maintain the uric acid within normal limits ; an excessive allopurinol therapy results in the accumulation of hypoxanthine and xanthine , which could result in xanthine stones . \n the pharmacological treatment of self - injurious behavior is addressed to control the deregulation in the dopaminergic , opiatergic , or serotonergic systems , as a possible cause of compulsive self - mutilating behavior . \n the administration of baclofen or benzodiazepines helps in muscle relaxation and keeps the patient calm . \n the use of hydroxytryptophan together with decarboxylase inhibitor has been proven effective in reducing self - mutilation for a short time . \n recent therapeutic options also include gabapentin , botulinum toxin a , injected into bilateral masseters , and deep brain stimulation in globus pallidus . \n the self - destruction behavior should be managed by a combination of physical restraints , behavior modifications , and pharmaceutical therapy , according to olson and houlihan 2000 . \n in the literature various therapeutic approaches to manage self - destruction behavior are described , but to date the treatment to solve the source of the problem has not been found yet . \n pharmacological treatment of dopaminergic dysfunction , the possible opiate , and/or serotonin system dysfunction have shown variable successes , but there are disadvantages to pharmacologic treatment , as it usually requires chronic use of the drug that often places the patients in a state of chronic stupor . the use of botulinum toxin a ( btx - a ) should be considered as a good treatment for self - mutilating behavior in lns , but the action of btx - a in decreasing self - inflicted injury is not clear . \n btx - a may be acting directly on peripheral nerve endings , inhibiting the release of acetylcholine and indirectly on the basal ganglia , resulting in muscle weakness and in decreased behavior . \n inquiries on btx - a nowadays are not enough and a further study is necessary to define the mechanism of action and the therapeutic results [ 9 , 10 ] . \n the  deep - brain stimulation  has been performed on a few patients with lesch - nyhan syndrome and some patients experienced a decrease in spastic self - injurious symptoms . \n published literature suggests that the role of dentist is crucial to prevent and control self - mutilation . in several cases , the extraction of deciduous teeth is adopted in young patient , but the extraction of all teeth is necessary also in permanent dentition . \n the extraction of only anterior permanent teeth ( incisors and canines ) , as recommended by rosenbloom and other authors , is not effective in preventing self - injury and so all permanent teeth are involved . \n the extraction of all teeth represents an extreme solution that may cause functional problems and requires a treatment under general anesthesia . to avoid the extractions , a series of intraoral appliance \n budnick studying a lesch - nyhan syndrome patient , unable to chew his lips for lack of anterior occlusion , decided to create an acrylic splint firstly cemented in the lower arch and secondly in the upper one . \n he experimented a new technique by covering the posterior teeth to create anterior open bite , eliminating wounds caused by incisors . \n in the most collaborative patients with few self - mutilations he proposed only normal care of preventive odontology ; in patients showing such a grade of collaboration and of spasticity to allow the intraoral alginate impression , he suggested the use of soft splint without cemented retention which caused hygienic and demineralization problems . \n finally , in patients with insufficient collaboration the only solution was represented by the extractions of all teeth . a hard acrylic chin - cup with lip extension fitted by means of orthodontic headgear was proposed . \n the appliance was well tolerated by patients and it guaranteed the health of the oral tissue but increased the dribbling habit with a consequent fungal infection of chins dermis . to solve fungal inflammation the appliance had to be removed . \n a thin soft resin mouth guard was employed to prevent finger and lower lip self - mutilation in combination with an arm restraint . in six days of treatment and after three months the patient self - mutilations disappeared and he stopped biting himself , also without the mouthguard . in order to prevent dermatitis a soft resin mouthguard not covering the lip was built . \n it was first cemented and then to increase the retention he preferred heat - cured acrylic resin due to adequate rigidity and he added head strap ; it had to rebuild to be adapted to development of teeth and it was not indicated in periodontal patients . in some resistant casese orthognathic surgery was proposed to create open bite and when the conservative options of treatment failed he suggested the amputation of teeth , as an alternative method to extraction of all teeth to preserve the alveolar bone . the upper and the lower incisors , canines , and the first premolars \n were performed with formocresol pulpotomies , the crowns were amputated on gingival level , and the dental root canals were filled with light curing glass ionomer cement and polished with softlex discs . the patient was sedated using choral hydrate and hydroxane , but in case of poor cooperation the general anesthesia was indicated [ 1719 ] . \n a removable acrylic dental appliance was made to create anterior open bite , orthodontic acrylic resin covered the palate , and occlusal surface of posterior teeth and adam 's claps on first upper molar increased the retention . a resin mouthguard thick in posterior part was combined with a lip bumper in order to open anterior bite and to protrude lower lip from the teeth , but this treatment had minimal to partial success . \n the acrylic resin bite plate 's retention was increased by a combination between adam 's clasps on the premolars and ball clasps among incisors . \n the operators of the orthodontic ward of gaslini hospital realized a new orthodontic device to preserve oral and perioral tissue of lns patients . at first irreversible hydrocolloid impressions of maxillary and mandibular arches \n these impressions were finally taken in spite of patient 's lack of compliance ; operators ' persuasive capacity , family , and operators ' efforts to change the negative behavior of m.c . were crucial . on these impressions \n a plaster model was built , the undercuts were eliminated ( figures 1 and 2 ) , and the orthodontic dispositive was realized by thermoforming disc materials ( with a hard copolyster outer layer and a soft polyurethane inner layer ) ( figure 3 ) , using a positive - pressure thermoformer ( ministar ) ( figures 2 and 5 ) . \n the hard side was placed in contact with teeth to increase friction and retention ; on the contrary the soft one was placed in contact with antagonist dental arch to prevent traumatic occlusion . \n the first devices were removed by patients ' tongue , so it was decided to change the dispositive , reducing mucosal flange to prevent the mouthguard 's removal ( figure 4 ) . at the beginning , patients used the device only for few hours , but time by time they were persuaded to wear it longer . at \n first a thick lower bite was made to produce an anterior open bite ; then it was substituted by a thinner maxillary and mandibular mouthguards well tolerated by the patient also during the meals . \n after these treatments , the patients were able to wear the device for 24 hours and it guaranteed the health of the oral and perioral tissue . \n the most common disadvantages of preventive intraoral devices are the design that may cause fungal infections , extensive laboratory time , and difficulty in daily oral care . also frequent adjustments are required and heavy biting forces added to poor cooperation may interfere with impression taking . \n these devices extend to the vestibule area and the splint that creates an open bite increases the drooling habit with a consequent fungal infection of chin dermis . \n cemented splint requires an extensive laboratory work , daily hygiene care is difficult , and the demineralization of the teeth is frequent . \n some patients with lns show a degree of collaboration to allow the intraoral alginate impression , in other lns patients is impossible to have a degree of cooperation on making the intraoral impression ; in fact sedation is sometime necessary . the use of putty - type vinyl polysiloxane impression material or quick alginate to overcome the insufficient patient 's collaboration that makes the intraoral impression very difficult is suggested . \n it is possible to obtain greater patient 's collaboration thanks to behavioral modification and persuasive capacity of family and operators . \n the simple intraoral device presented by gaslini operators is easy to fabricate ; it is a mouthguard realized by thermoforming disc and characterized by two different matrices : hard and soft . \n the hard matrix guarantees a good retention , so during the cementation , the head straps , the splint extension to vestibule area , and the metal clasps are not necessary to give stability . \n the double matrix device is readily removed for everyday cleaning and the placement is also comfortable . \n the bite is very thin , it permits that the patient can wear the mouthguard all day , also during the meals , and consequently the drooling habit is not accentuated . \n the device is built on the patient plaster model ; it can be customized for each individual case . \n heavy biting force and poor patient 's collaboration may interfere with impression taking . in the case \n described here the first impression to create an individual impression trays was taken and a second one to fabricate the device . \n also the work was simplified by the use of quick alginate . in a second moment \n the efficacy of this device was observed during a period of about 7 years . during these years \n the major difficulties encountered during this therapy are as follows : necessity of modifying the dispositive to adapt it to the mouth changes , risk of small cracks on the occlusal resin bite that must be often repaired \n . necessity of modifying the dispositive to adapt it to the mouth changes , risk of small cracks on the occlusal resin bite that must be often repaired . \n in conclusion the literature analysis demonstrates that the intraoral appliances , despite some limitations , can represent a good alternative option to invasive treatment and a good choice of therapy to limit and to prevent self - mutilative behavior in lns patients . \n the thin resin mouthguard described was successfully employed to prevent self - mutilation of oral and perioral structures . \n it represented a conservative solution and a good alternative option to invasive treatment of extracting the teeth or of orthognathic surgery . \n in addition , the device is easy to build and is well accepted by patient . a good choice of treatment for improving the quality of life of these patients can be represented .",

      "document": "the use of ergotamines causing ischemia of peripheral vessels has been reported , particularly in patients with peripheral vascular disease . \n ischemic bowel induced by ergotamines is a much rarer event , with few documented cases in the literature . \n while colitis is always on the differential diagnosis of hospital patients with abdominal pain , the majority of cases are secondary to infectious colitis associated with antibiotic therapy . \n when suspected , non - occlusive mesenteric ischemia can be treated with anti - coagulation and blood pressure support with intravenous fluids . \n the predisposition for ischemia in patients with chronic constipation secondary to opioid use is amplified by concomitant use of vasoactive medications to control symptoms of migraine headache . \n while abdominal ct scanning is frequently used to assess colonic pathology , findings often lag behind those identified at the time of colonoscopy . \n patchy areas of ischemia are often managed non - surgically by discontinuing the offending medication . \n widespread necrosis , coupled with clinical deterioration , as in this case , mandated immediate surgical intervention to prevent irreversible septic shock . \n a 48-year - old woman with a long - standing history of intractable migraine headaches was admitted to our institution 's specialty headache unit for aggressive management . she had no known history of peripheral vascular or cardiac disease but \n has been admitted multiple times for treatment of her headaches since her initial diagnosis in 2003 . \n during the course of each of these hospitalizations , she had received one to two courses of dihydroergotamine mesylate ( dhe ) 45 . during this admission she received two courses of dhe 0.5 mg  1 , then 1 mg every 8 h for a total of eight doses , on days 13 and the second course of therapy on days 79 . \n several hours after the final dose of her second round she became obtunded , minimally responsive and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/45 mm hg . on physical examination her abdomen was moderately distended with few bowel sounds . \n mmol / l , white blood cell count was 18.0 ( with 17% bands ) , and stool was clostridium difficile negative . \n the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit , given intravenous fluid boluses , started on vasopressors , and given broad spectrum antibiotics . \n her chest radiograph was unremarkable , and her abdominal x - rays showed only mild prominence of the colon . over the next several hours she became progressively acidotic with a worsening bandemia . \n a bedside colonoscopy showed diffuse ischemic colitis with fecal impaction and no pseudomembranes ( fig . \n operative findings showed a peritoneal cavity filled with murky , foul - smelling fluid and gangrene of the descending colon was seen with necrosis in the area immediately distal to the splenic flexure to the sigmoid colon . \n final pathology on the surgical specimen showed 86 cm of patchy , dark green / black large bowel , consistent with ischemic necrosis . \n the final diagnosis was gangrenous large bowel , ischemic colitis with thrombi or emboli noted . \n a hypercoaguable panel was performed following the operation and the patient was negative for clotting disorders . \n the differential diagnosis of ischemic colitis includes arterial occlusion , caused by emboli or thrombus , venous thrombosis , and non - occlusive ischemia caused by systemic hypotension or , as is strongly suspected in this case , ergotamine - induced vasospasm . \n a diagnosis of ergotamine - induced vasospasm is a diagnosis of exclusion , made when all other etiologies of ischemia have been ruled out . in this case , \n an arterial occlusion is unlikely , because there was no palpable thrombus and there was no clear ischemic demarcation to suggest a major vessel distribution . \n the patient had no history of cardiac arrhythmias , such as atrial fibrillation , to predispose her to emboli . \n furthermore she was a non - smoker and had no other cardiac risk factors such as atherosclerosis or hyperlipidemia . \n emboli to inferior mesenteric artery ( i m a ) are exceedingly rare , and there are no reported cases of spontaneous emboli or thrombosis to i m a . \n all reported cases of i m a thrombosis are subsequent to trauma [ 1 , 2 ] . \n venous thrombosis as a cause of ischemia in this patient is equally unlikely as there were no signs of venous congestion or stasis at the time of surgery . \n the patient had no hypercoagulable disorder and on examination the colon was not edematous and no clot was identified in the vasculature . \n ischemia secondary to systemic hypotension alone would have resulted in a watershed - type distribution of gangrene . in this case \n the most probable cause of this event was non - occlusive mesenteric ischemia in the i m a distribution and more specifically the left colic artery due to intense vasoconstriction induced by high - dose ergotamine use . \n underlying bowel wall distention from the impacted stool in combination with vasoconstriction from ergotamine is the most likely etiology for this patient 's bowel ischemia . \n dhe is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes . \n its therapeutic activity in the treatment of migraine headaches is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5-ht1d receptors . according to the neurovascular theory of migraine , \n it is hypothesized that activation of 5-ht1d receptors on intracranial blood vessels leads to vasoconstriction . \n the 5-ht1d receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal are also activated , causing inhibition of pro -

      "document": "gestational diabetes mellitus ( gdm ) is defined as abnormal glucose tolerance that is first identified or diagnosed during pregnancy . \n it is estimated that approximately 2% to 5% of all pregnancies in korean women are complicated by gdm . \n the clinical significance of gdm is that it increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes . in a recent large - scale multinational prospective study , \n increased maternal glucose concentration during pregnancy was significantly associated with increased neonatal birth weight , primary cesarean delivery , neonatal hypoglycemia , and increased placental c - peptide levels . \n after parturition , about 15% of gdm women had persistent diabetes at an early postpartum period of 2 months . \n women with a previous history of gdm are at increased risk of future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) . \n the risk of t2 dm is 3.5 times greater in women with a history of gdm compared to the general population in koreans . \n in addition , offspring of gdm women are also at risk of developing obesity and t2 dm . \n the incidence of gdm is expected to rise , as it will parallel the increasing rate of obesity and t2 dm . \n furthermore , the recent recommendation from the international association of diabetes and pregnancy study group has lowered the diagnostic threshold of gdm and is expected to increase the incidence of gdm . \n gdm women have an increased positive family history of t2 dm . compared to pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance , \n gdm women have a significantly greater parental history of t2 dm ( 13.2% vs. 30.1% , p < 0.001 ) . \n in addition , both gdm women and their offspring are at increased risk of future development of t2 dm . the heritability estimate of t2 dm was reported to be quite high ( h = 0.69 ) in a recent study performed in europeans . \n these findings are indirect evidence that gdm has familial tendency . however , there is no study that has specifically evaluated the heritability of gdm using familial clustering or twins \n . it would be important to estimate the heritability of gdm and compare it with that of t2 dm in women . \n during normal pregnancy , women experience increased adiposity and weight gain , which begin near mid - pregnancy and progress throughout the third trimester . in this period , insulin resistance ensues as a consequence of multiple factors , including increased production of placental growth hormone , estrogen , and tumor necrosis factor  [ 14 , 15 ] . \n pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance can increase their -cell insulin secretion in response to this increased insulin resistance during pregnancy . \n although the mechanism of increased -cell insulin secretion during pregnancy is not fully understood , it is reported that prolactin , which increases during pregnancy , can repress islet menin levels and stimulate -cell proliferation in mice . \n in addition , recent reports suggest that -cell serotonin signaling is also a major determinant of -cell mass during pregnancy . \n it has been suggested from several clinical studies that gdm women have limited insulin secretion capacity that can not compensate for the increased insulin resistance . \n similar to gdm , t2 dm is also characterized by relative deficiency in insulin secretion in the face of increased insulin resistance . \n various factors , including increased age , obesity , high - fat diet , and sedentary lifestyle , can induce insulin resistance , and those who do not have sufficient -cell insulin secretory capacity are more likely to develop t2 dm . \n therefore , it is said that a large proportion of gdm women are experiencing future t2 dm in advance . \n based on the findings that gdm women are at high risk of t2 dm and both gdm and t2 dm share similar pathophysiologies , it is reasonable to assume that they might also share similar genetic risk factors . \n soon after the initial reports of t2 dm genome - wide association ( gwa ) studies [ 18 - 21 ] , several studies investigated whether genetic variants that were identified through gwa studies of t2 dm were also associated with the risk of gdm [ 22 , 23 ] . \n genotyped variants in or near cdkal1 , cdkn2a/2b , fto , hhex , igf2bp2 , slc30a8 , tcf7l2 , kcnj11 , and pparg in 869 gdm women and 632 carefully selected nondiabetic control subjects . \n they found that genetic variants in cdkal1 and cdkn2a/2b were highly associated with the risk of gdm ( p < 1  10 ) . \n in addition , variants in hhex , igf2bp2 , slc30a8 , and tcf7l2 were all nominally associated with gdm ( p < 0.05 ) . among a total of 18 genetic variants studied , 9 reached a nominal significance level ( p < 0.05 ) . in fig . \n 1 , the risk allele frequency as well as the odds ratios of known t2 dm variants are compared among a control group ( n = 632 , men : women = 287 : 345 ) , t2 dm group ( n = 761 , men : women = 354 : 407 ) , and gdm group ( n = 869 ) in koreans [ 22 , 24 ] . for most of the variants , \n there was an increasing trend of risk allele frequencies from control to t2 dm and from t2 dm to gdm . \n .   also found that variants in tcf7l2 , cdkal1 , and tcf2 were significantly associated with the risk of gdm in europeans , consisting of 283 gdm women and 2,446 glucose - tolerant control women . \n variants in kcnq1 , which were first identified in an east asian t2 dm gwa study , were also significantly associated with the risk of gdm in koreans ( p < 0.05 ) . \n recently , it was reported that tph1 and htr2b play a crucial role in regulating pancreatic -cell mass during pregnancy in a mouse model and that their genetic alterations could result in gdm . \n a total 6 genetic variants in htr2b and 11 variants in tph1 were identified and genotyped in korean gdm women and control subjects . \n although there were no significant associations of these variants with the risk of gdm , they were associated with measures of obesity and weight gain during pregnancy . \n following these candidate approach studies was a two - staged gwa study that was performed in korean gdm women . \n a total of 468 gdm women and 1,242 nondiabetic control women were genotyped using affymetrix genome - wide human snp array 5.0 . \n variants that passed the prespecified p - value threshold in the stage 1 genome scan were further genotyped in 931 gdm women and 783 nondiabetic control women . \n two variants , one located in an intron of cdkal1 ( rs7754840 ) and one near mtnr1b ( rs10830962 ) , were associated with a risk of gdm at a genome - wide significance level ( p = 6.65  10 and p = 2.49  10 , respectively ) . \n although variants in mtnr1b have been previously reported to be associated with increased fasting glucose levels , the study was the first to report that mtnr1b variants are associated with gdm at a genome - wide significance level . \n one of the limitations was that it was not sufficiently powered to find truly novel genetic variants that were only specific in gdm . \n it should be noted that current gwa and gwa meta - analysis performed in t2 dm recruits more than 100,000 cases and controls . \n one of the interesting findings was that genetic variants of t2 dm were enriched in gdm subjects . among \n the 34 confirmed t2 dm genetic variants , 8 were associated with a risk of gdm . \n in addition , when the -coefficients ( or odds ratio ) of the variants derived from the logistic regression were compared between gdm and t2 dm , there was a significant positive correlation of -coefficients between the two . \n these findings suggest that gdm and t2 dm might share similar genetic backgrounds , at least in part . \n gwa studies have opened a new era in diabetes research . our knowledge on the genetic predisposition of gdm as well as t2 dm \n is expected to increase even faster as next - generation sequencing technology is applied to this field . \n there should be even larger gwa studies on gdm , and gwa meta - analyses should be available . in this way , we could find variants that have smaller effect sizes but are more specific to gdm than t2 dm . in order to understand the genetic determinants of glucose and insulin concentration during pregnancy , \n a fast way is to see whether genetic variants that are known to affect glucose or insulin concentration in the normal population also affect glucose or insulin concentration during pregnancy . \n in addition , a gwa study on glucose or insulin concentration during pregnancy should also be helpful . \n in this way , we would be able to better understand the pathophysiology of gdm . by definition \n , gdm encompasses women with pre - exiting t2 dm , maturity onset diabetes of the young ( mody ) , or even type 1 diabetes patients that were not diagnosed previously . \n in particular , about 15% of gdm patients remain diabetic at early postpartum periods , and a significant portion of these subjects might fall into the category of mody . \n the contribution of genetic variants known to cause mody , such as gck and hnf1a , in gdm has been reviewed in recent literature . \n however , whole - exome sequencing will provide us with better bird 's eye view on the contribution of mody genes in gdm . \n in addition , it might be able to find novel mody genes in those who have persistent diabetes after gdm pregnancy and also have a strong family history of diabetes . \n one of the first steps in translating the genetic information into clinical practice would be to predict the future development of t2 dm in gdm women . \n gdm women are at particularly high risk of developing t2 dm and require preventive measures and early screening of t2 dm . \n genetic information might improve our prediction of t2 dm in women with a history of gdm . \n this is an area of active research [ 31 , 32 ] , and we are looking forward to studies that use genotype risk scores in predicting t2 dm in gdm women \n . a similar approach could also be applied in predicting gdm , as more genetic variants associated with gdm are expected to be revealed . \n the functional consequences of the current common genetic variants identified through gwa studies of gdm are not well understood yet . \n it is not known whether they are markers in linkage disequilibrium with nearby causal variants or whether they have unknown but relevant functional roles . \n next - generation sequencing might give answers to these questions , but a huge number of samples and much effort will be required . \n gdm women are at increased risk of developing t2 dm and have familial clustering of t2 dm . a common pathophysiology that is shared by gdm and t2 dm is impaired compensatory increase in insulin secretion to overcome the increased insulin resistance . \n the gwa study of gdm enabled us to investigate the common genetic risk factors of gdm , and it revealed that gdm and t2 dm share similar genetic backgrounds , at least in part ( fig . \n although this information has significantly improved our insight in the pathogenesis of gdm , there are more unanswered questions remaining that should be explicitly expressed . using the technology of next - generation sequencing \n in addition , we hope that personalized genomic medicine could be available using the advances in the genetics of gdm and t2 dm .",

      "document": "Nine British nationals have been detained in Turkey after allegedly trying to enter Syria illegally.\n\nThe group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border.\n\nTheir intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear.\n\nThe Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities.\n\nThe BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to.\n\n\"Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?\" he said.\n\nThe group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK.\n\nThey have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken.\n\nThe United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations.\n\nAbout 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there.\n\nMost are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group.\n\nAround half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said.\n\nThe latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey.\n\nThe three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail.\n\nThey had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul.\n\nFadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was \"taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria\".\n\nHe said there was now \"more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria\".\n\nThe Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning.\n\nIn February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria.\n\nShamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.\n\nTurkish officials said they had not been warned promptly enough by British police to intercept them - Scotland Yard denied this.",

      "document": "the feasibility and effectiveness of vision screening programs for detection of glaucoma , diabetic retinopathy ( dr ) , cataracts , age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) have been described [ 13 ] . \n the majority of such programs employ digital color fundus imaging to determine whether a follow - up examination with an ophthalmologist or optometrist is required . \n several investigators initiated studies examining the use of additional technologies and imaging modalities , including software - assisted digital filters , retinal thickness analyzer , and slit lamp microscopy to enhance the quality of obtained images aimed at improving detection and characterization of vision - threatening diseases ( vtds ) [ 46 ] . \n in addition , using a structured questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction attending a teleophthalmology versus conventional ( i.e. , in - person ) screening for dr , kumari rani et al . found that 34% of participants preferred teleophthalmology to conventional screening and 61% felt that both types of screenings were equally satisfying . in this and other studies , \n the most common reasons given for improved patient satisfaction with teleophthalmology versus conventional screenings were cost reduction , ability to view images directly , decreased travel time , and direct consultation with a clinician [ 7 , 8 ] . \n fundus autofluorescence ( faf ) is a specific wavelength light emission from lipofuscin and other molecules that accumulate in retinal pigment epithelial ( rpe ) cells secondary to photoreceptor oxidative damage . \n specific faf patterns have been described for numerous ocular diseases and conditions , and they may also be useful in monitoring disease progression . in the current study , \n we describe and analyze the incorporation of faf technology in our community - based ocular screening program . \n screening participants included homeless and working - poor individuals at soup kitchens and churches in essex county , new jersey . \n fifty consecutive individuals were enrolled in this prospective , pilot imaging study in march 2011 . \n a detailed description of our screening program has been published previously . in brief , the screening team consisted of : ( 1 ) senior medical students who completed an intake form ( personal and family history of medical and ocular problems , smoking history , etc . ) , measured blood pressure , pulse , and oxygen saturation , assessed visual acuity ( va ; simav , padova , italy ) and visual fields ( frequency doubling technology ; carl zeiss meditec , inc . , \n dublin , ca ) ; ( 2 ) an imaging technician who measured intraocular pressure ( iop ; canon tx - f full auto non - contact tonometer , tokyo , japan ) , performed nonmydriatic color and faf imaging ( canon cx-1 15.1 megapixel camera with cmos sensor , tokyo , japan ) ; and ( 3 ) an onsite medical director who analyzed complete screening data , reviewed color and faf images , and made referrals for follow - up examination as needed . \n those participants requiring additional follow - up examinations were referred to the eye clinic at the institute of ophthalmology and visual science at university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey ( newark , nj ) that accepts uninsured patients . \n presenting va was defined as the subject 's entering vision with distance correction ( i.e. , contacts or glasses ) , if applicable . \n snellen va was converted into log mar scale , averaged , and then reconverted back into snellen va . by starting the screening process in a staggered fashion ( i.e. , at different stations ) , on average , \n 11 subjects were screened per hour ( not including the time required for reviewing screening data and counseling the participants ) . based on personal , social , and/or family history , information packets ( available in english or spanish ) were handed out and participants were counseled accordingly . \n nonmydriatic color and faf images were saved and viewed on a high - resolution , wide - screen fujitsu laptop ( kanagawa , japan ) using digital imaging and communications in medicine ( dicom)-compatible canon eye - q software ( canon medical systems , irvine , ca ) . \n these were evaluated side - by - side for potential changes in the optic nerve head ( i.e. , cup - to - disc ratio , asymmetry , neuro - retinal rim color , and nerve fiber layer integrity ) , blood vessels ( i.e. , artery - to - vein ratio and nicking , microaneurysm formation , and neovascularization ) , and macula and posterior pole ( i.e. , pigmentary changes and drusen formation ) . \n following nonmydriatic color imaging , a second set of nonmydriatic images was taken in the faf mode ( 530/640  nm exciter / barrier filters ) . \n subjects were allowed to dark - adapt for 2 - 3 minutes . in order to prevent accommodation and pupillary constriction , \n a single photograph was captured per eye at a 300 watts / second flash intensity . \n two to three minutes were required in between in order for the eyes to recover . \n the resulting 256 monochromatic , grayscale images were then analyzed side - by - side with color images . \n ( i.e. , amd , drusen ) , the emphasis was placed on the macular region , which was assessed for changes in fluorescence . \n hypofluorescence signified rpe cell death , while hyperfluorescence suggested active expansion of area of geographic atrophy ( ga ) . \n hyperfluorescence can be classified according to specific phenotypic patterns that can be associated with amd progression . for glaucoma , \n the peripapillary region was of particular interest as hyperfluorescence in this area has been shown to correlate with optic nerve atrophy and/or glaucoma progression . \n this is different from a myopic crescent , which would appear as a gray band typically spanning the temporal peripapillary region . as for dr \n , we focused on diabetic macular edema ( dme ) that may appear as areas of hyperfluorescence . \n females represented 52% ( n = 26 ) . there were 29 ( 58% ) african americans , seven ( 14% ) caucasians , seven ( 14% ) hispanics , and seven ( 14% ) others . \n nine ( 18% ) subjects had diabetes mellitus type 2 for a mean duration of 10.5 years ; 13 ( 26% ) had hypertension ( based on self - reported history and/or blood pressure measurements at the screening ) ; and 16 ( 32% ) were active smokers . only 14 ( 28% ) had a dilated fundus examination within the past year . \n mean  sd iop was 14.8  3.9  mm  hg and 14.9  4.4  mm  hg in the right and left eye , respectively . \n performing color and faf imaging on each eye resulted in reviewing 44 images per hour . \n we identified nine ( 18% ) individuals with distinct color and/or faf patterns representing dr ( n = 3 ) , focal rpe defects ( n = 2 ) , dme ( n = 1 ) , amd ( n = 1 ) , central serous retinopathy ( csr ; n = 1 ) , and ocular trauma ( n = 1 ) ( figure 1 ) . in eight ( 89% ) of these subjects , faf imaging improved detection and/or characterization of pathology versus color imaging . \n for example , in individuals with dr , faf identified a larger number of dot - blot hemorrhages and microaneurysms , and it was superior at outlining rpe disturbance compared to color imaging ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . while only minor perifoveal rpe hypopigmentation was evident on the color image , we identified two patients with extensive focal rpe defects after faf imaging ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) . \n in the subject with amd , faf imaging provided more detail than color imaging in terms of the extent of rpe disturbance ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) ) . in an individual with chronic csr , although we were able to appreciate a circular lesion nasal to the fovea in the color photograph , the faf image was superior at characterizing the full extent of this lesion ( e.g. , rpe hyperfluorescence ) ( figures 2(g ) and 2(h ) ) . in the case of ocular trauma , \n extensive fibrosis was appreciated on color imaging , while faf imaging further delineated an extensive area of rpe degeneration ( figures 2(i ) and 2(j ) ) . \n the only pathologic finding that was better appreciated on color imaging was dme with extensive hard exudates that were not apparent on faf imaging ( figures 2(k ) and 2(l ) ) . \n based on these findings , seven ( 14% ) subjects were referred to a retinal specialist and two ( 4% ) to a primary ophthalmologist . \n all subjects were successfully imaged under the study conditions and none were referred for a dilated examination due to small pupil size . \n as far as we can discern , this is the first prospective pilot imaging study set out to determine the feasibility of integrating faf technology in a community - based ocular screening program . \n we postulated that correlation of color and faf imaging may allow for improved characterization of damage to the retina and rpe . \n tool in several retinal diseases / conditions , including amd , hydroxychloroquine toxicity , and serpiginous - like choroiditis [ 14 , 15 ] . logistically during our screening , the process was aided by the fact that the canon cx-1 camera comes specifically configured to perform color , faf , and other types of imaging . \n therefore , we did not have to be concerned about transporting an extra piece of equipment to our screenings ( which commonly occur in difficult to access locations such as basements or buildings without elevators ) , or decreasing the number of participants screened due to space restrictions . \n additionally , the inter - phased imaging software allowed for side - by - side viewing of color and faf fundus images , which aided in comparing and correlating the ocular findings . \n an average of 22 eyes were imaged , and 44 color and faf digital images were reviewed per hour . \n identification of vtds necessitating referral to a general or specialty ophthalmologist occurred in nine ( 18% ) individuals . in our previous studies , \n an average of 2630 eyes was imaged per hour and the rate of vtd detection was 1030% ; however , neither of these studies employed two different types of imaging modalities [ 11 , 16 ] . \n of the nine ( 18% ) individuals with identified vtds in our current study , only seven ( 14% ) would have been referred for a comprehensive examination based on results of color fundus imaging ( excluding the two participants with focal rpe defects ) . \n thus , in addition to improved characterization of pathology identified on color fundus imaging , incorporation of faf imaging as a complementary technology in this cohort increased ocular pathology detection in our screenings by 29% ( from seven to nine eyes with pathology ) .   in the present study \n , we were able to show successful integration of faf imaging in a community - based ocular screening program . \n the imaging itself was simple to perform and it resulted in enhanced detection of abnormalities in a wide variety of retinal diseases when performed side - by - side with color fundus imaging . \n some of the potential limitations to using faf technology in screenings include : ( a ) increased cost of the faf camera versus a color fundus camera ; ( b ) increased screening time to allow for reversal of pupil constriction secondary to higher flash intensity required to acquire faf images ; ( c ) our currently limited understanding of the utility of faf in certain vtds like glaucoma and dr ; ( d ) requirement of patient cooperation and clear ocular media ( e.g. , without a visually significant cataract or vitreous opacity ) in order to obtain high - quality images ; and ( e ) potential difficulty with image interpretation due to absence of standardized equipment , protocols , and grading systems . a cost - benefit analysis , including the final impact on local health indicators , should be pursued . \n although the faf capable camera used in the present study is more expensive than a conventional color fundus camera , the potential of faf to improve ocular disease detection warrants further study . this may be especially pertinent for retina specialists for the diagnosis , detection of progression , anticipation of prognosis , and treatment of amd , dme , and so forth . \n earlier detection may positively impact the exorbitant costs attributable to undiagnosed ocular diseases such as amd , glaucoma , and dr [ 1720 ] . \n future work correlating faf findings with optical coherence tomography may enhance evaluation of diseases that damage the retina , rpe , and choroid , thereby potentially avoiding false positive referrals . \n based on our findings , we believe that faf imaging is a complementary technology that may have a significant impact on teleophthalmology applications . \n advances in imaging technologies make screening for vtds more accurate by employing complementary imaging technologies such as color fundus imaging , software - assisted analysis , and faf . \n in the current study , the number of subjects allowed for a descriptive analysis only . a larger follow - up study designed to compare the sensitivity , specificity , and positive and negative predictive values for vtd detection with and without the incorporation of faf is warranted . \n more specifically , a prospective , double - armed sequential screening study in which referral patterns based on color fundus imaging only versus color fundus imaging followed by faf imaging should be performed . \n the potential impact of improved characterization and detection of ocular pathology on disease burden ( including cost to society ) warrants further investigation . as a corollary \n , we believe that it would be pertinent to conduct cost analysis studies in order to make recommendations regarding the economic feasibility of incorporating faf imaging in ocular screening programs .",

range : 35 - 76 years ) . \n the pulse oximetry and spirometric variables of the patients are described in the table 1 . \n physiological variables of the included patients there was not a significant association between fev1 % predicted and spo2 % ( p value > 0.05 ) , while there was a significant association between fev1/fvc % predicted and spo2 % ( r = 0.556 , p value < 0.001 ) [ figures 1 and 2 ] . \n the dotted curves represent the 95% confidence intervals of fev1% for a given spo2% correlation between fev1/fvc% predicted and spo2% in the included patients . \n the dotted curves represent the 95% confidence intervals of fev1/fvc% for a given spo2% in addition , the association among age with spo2% , fev1% predicted and also fev1/fvc % predicted was not significant statistically ( p value > 0.05 ) . \n the median fev1 % predicted in the stage 0 was [ median 90% , interquartile range ( 90%-95% ) ] ; stage i was 83% , 75%-89% ; stage ii was 62% , 51%-79% ; stage iii was 45% , 38%-48% and also stage iv was 27% , 21%-33% , which was a significant differences among them in five stages of gold using kruskal - wallis test ( p value < 0.05 ) . \n the median fev1/fvc % predicted in the stage 0 was [ median 74% , interquartile range ( 73%-89% ] ;

for current smokers : r = 0.13 , p = 0.252 and for former smokers ; r = 0.19 , p = 0.047 ) . also , median spo2 values did not differ between gold stages ( median test : p = 0.079 ) . \n these observations suggest that pulse oximetry is mainly helpful when the symptoms are deteriorated because of severe airflow obstruction ( fev1 % predicted < 50% ) . \n this is consistent with the findings of previous studies indicating that the rate of tests with spo2 < 92% increases when the fev1 % predicted value is < 50% in stable copd patients . \n it is noteworthy that our population was consisting of those suffering from mild to severe copd who came to an outpatient clinic . \n therefore , the findings of this study may be different from those acquired in hospital - based studies . in this regard , a turkish study in the patients with severe copd demonstrated a high sensitivity for both spo2 and fev1 in reflecting hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( 83.9 and 90.3% , respectively ) . \n although monitoring of saturation is recommended only for patients with severe disease , pulse oximetry can identify those who might benefit from oxygen therapy or pulmonary rehabilitation . \n meanwhile , overestimation of arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation might occur in spo2 values < 80% , especially in the patients with darkly pigmented skin . \n oxygen saturations are not helpful for the diagnosis of copd ; saturations of < 98% provides a sensitivity of 79% , but specificity of only 37% . \n however , pulse oximetry may help in determining the criteria for long - term oxygen therapy or the need for referral to hospital in acute exacerbations . according to dutch family practice guidelines , if pulse oximetry shows spo2 \n moreover , initiation of oxygen therapy based on an oxygen saturation value < 90% is considered another possible application for pulse oximetry in the primary care . \n although the current oximeters are practically accurate , they may produce false data in the presence of carboxyhemoglobinemia , hemodynamic instability , dark skin pigmentation , jaundice , and also during the exercise . \n the oximeter - indicated saturation may significantly overestimate arterial po2 , if the patient is alkalemic . \n furthermore , the study depicted a significant association between fev1/fvc% predicted and spo2% ( r = 0.556 , p value = 0.001 ) . \n the fev1/fvc ratio , also called tiffeneau - pinelli index , is a calculated ratio for the diagnosis of obstructive or restrictive lung disease . \n it represents the proportion of a person 's vital capacity that is exhaled in the first second of expiration . \n the above - mentioned finding was observed in nomori et al . on 83 patients who underwent lobectomy for lung cancer . \n a number of studies have showed that fev1/fvc depends significantly on age in healthy subjects . \n however , the current study did not show the correlation in the copd patients , which could be due to small number of the included cases in our study . \n further a larger study may clarify such association in copd patients . in this study the mean age was 55.09  11.61 years with no significant relationship between age and fev1% of predicted in copd patients , and this was matching with the previous studies . \n furthermore , the current study may demonstrate that fev1 is essential for the diagnosis and quantification of the respiratory impairment resulting from copd . \n but , fev1 is known to poorly correlate with symptoms , quality of life exacerbation frequency and exercise intolerance . in total , the study did not support that oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry to replace analysis of an arterial blood gas sample in the clinical evaluation of oxygenation in health care patients with copd . \n unfortunately , we did not include a standardized assessment of dyspnoea in our study , which would have enabled us to investigate the relationship between the severity of dyspnoea and spo2 . \n another limitation is that we did not measure arterial blood gas components , such as pao2 , which would have allowed us to acquire more comprehensive results . \n however , these findings support the claim that spirometric parameters , but not spo2 level , could be useful indicators of the patient outcome , although further evidence needs to be obtained . \n the study may demonstrate that oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry appears to be independent of the degree of airways obstruction as quantified by the fev1 ; although further evidence needs to be assessed these preliminary findings .",

      "document": "UK manufacturing activity contracted in April for the first time in three years, a survey has indicated, adding to fears over the economy's strength.\n\nThe Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output.\n\nIt is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013.\n\nFirms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum.\n\nA slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production.\n\nThe index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low.\n\nRob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth.\n\n\"The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.\"\n\nLast week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector.\n\nDavid Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: \"Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality.\n\n\"An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk.\n\n\"A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.\"\n\nThe Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month.\n\nLee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.\n\n\"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"",

      "document": "in this issue of critical care , laporta and coworkers   review a multidisciplinary working group 's analysis of a case study on the causes of and solutions for staff turnover in an intensive care unit ( icu ) setting . \n this issue is of profound significance to health care leaders in western countries because the workforce is shrinking as a result of impending baby boomer retirements and , as the population ages , the demand for intensive care services will grow considerably . \n these demographic factors are further compounded by the fact that the complexity of care provided in the icu demands professionals who are highly trained and skilled . in this environment \n , turnover can be costly to the organization because of the significant expenses associated with recruiting and training workers . \n there are many well documented reasons for staff turnover in the intensive care setting that are highlighted by laporta and coworkers   as core reasons . \n these core reasons include job dissatisfaction due to inflexible scheduling practises , insufficient opportunity for professional development , as well as a lack of collaborative decision making around clinical and practice issues . \n the authors discuss that data on icu turnover comes from nursing literature and that this research may be applicable to other health care professionals . \n however , it is important not to assume that reasons for turnover are the same among different groups of health care providers and that staff turnover is something to be avoided at all costs . \n for example , misra - hebert and coworkers   state that one contributor to physician turnover is conflict between the physician 's and organization 's philosophy and goals . \n physician turnover in this case may be beneficial both to the physician and organization if the two parties can not reconcile their differences and the conflict impacts on the ability of both parties to move forward . \n there are other important reasons for turnover that should be considered by icu leaders , and these include burnout and generational diversity . \n burnout is a prevalent phenomenon in icus , and the nursing literature suggests that issues such as moral distress when engaging in futile care contributes to burnout . in the medical literature causes of physician burnout include volume of work , increased expectations of the public , lack of sleep and the possibility of being sued . \n the consequence of burnout is that there is a negative impact on quality of care and staff morale , which can ultimately cause turnover . \n for example , gunderson   indicates that physicians who are dissatisfied may engage in inappropriate prescribing patterns . \n neuhauser , furthermore , discusses how environments with rigid systems and attitudes among the leadership will decrease staff morale because staff desire flexible policies and autonomy in decision - making . \n the generational diversity found in the icu environment can also be a source of turnover of staff . \n it is well documented that generation x ( born in 19651980 ) and the millennial generation ( born in 19802000 ) have a strong desire for more balanced work life than veterans ( born in 19251945 ) and baby boomers ( born in 19461964 ) . \n research conducted by lorin and coworkers   on internal medicine residents of the millenial generation showed that although 41% considered a fellowship in critical care , only 3.4% chose this training because of lack of leisure time and stress levels among faculty and fellows . \n clearly , it is important for leaders to be attuned to these generational differences when developing recruitment and retention plans and redesigning the workplace environment . \n the review from laporta and coworkers   also highlights the importance of icu leadership working with frontline staff to create a vision and strategy that addresses the core reasons for turnover . \n it is essential that this vision be aligned with the vision , mission and values , and strategic plan of the health care organization . \n furthermore , the team should assess whether their hospital is highly reputable , has high patient satisfaction , and sufficient resources and equipment to provide care . \n all of these components are signs of a positive work environment , and leadership can build on these attributes to recruit and retain staff . the other key factor in this process is the use of a team work approach \n . team work training in the areas of conflict resolution , learning styles and giving feedback will help the staff to work together to create and achieve an inspiring vision . \n although the financial and human resource investments required to engage in this process are considerable , there is substantial evidence in the literature that highly functioning , satisfied teams lead to more efficient patient care and better outcomes . \n staff turnover is a critical issue that icu leaders need to understand and address in their unit settings . \n attention to this issue with a systematic , evidence - based approach that focuses on team work and collaboration will not only improve retention but will also make the icu a highly competitive and desirable place to work . \n  \n ",

      "document": "for decades metal ceramic restorations have been considered the  gold standard  treatment for the fabrication of prosthetic crowns and fixed partial dentures ( fpds ) . \n ceramic materials with different processing routes were developed to play this role without the inherent disadvantage of a metal framework . at first , the main drawback with the use of all - ceramic crowns was bulk fractures due to the brittle nature of ceramics and the lower mechanical properties when compared with metal frameworks . \n the advent of computer - aided design / computer - aided manufacturing ( cad / cam ) technology allowed the possibility of working with high strength polycrystalline materials , shifting the problem to the veneering ceramics . \n this seems reasonable since the veneering ceramics present lower flexural strength ( 90 - 120 mpa ) compared with the yttria - stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycristals substructure ( 900 - 1200 mpa ) . \n this way , the use of glass - ceramic ingots for pressing veneering ceramics onto zirconia frameworks was proposed to reduce the prevalence of veneer chippings / fractures . \n however , attempts to improve the microstructure and mechanical properties of veneering ceramics did not result in increased reliability . \n in addition , identical chipping failure patterns were observed . despite the numerous advantages of cad / cam technology \n , it seems that at some point clinicians and laboratory technicians started paying less attention to basic principles of substructure design in fixed prosthodontics . \n this article describes an alternative technique for the customization of cad / cam frameworks through a dual - scan process . \n this procedure provides adequate porcelain support and thickness in a predictable manner with little additional effort and cost to both clinicians and laboratories . \n a 46-year - old woman , presented with a carious lesion under a metal onlay restoration on tooth number 16 requesting an esthetic restoration . \n she was advised of the available metal ceramic and all - ceramic options before selecting a zirconia - based all - ceramic crown . \n first , a full - contour waxing of the final restoration was made to guide all clinical and laboratory steps . \n the other uncut was used to fabricate the temporary restoration with bis - acrylic resin ( protemp 4 , 3 m espe , st . \n tooth preparation was carried out leaving 1.5 mm of space for the final restoration in the axial walls and 2.0 mm in the occlusal area [ figure 1 ] . \n the temporary restoration corresponded to the patient and dentist 's expectations functionally , biologically and esthetically . \n commonly cad / cam systems deliver a uniform substructure ranging from 0.3 mm to 0.6 mm in thickness . \n the software provides uniform substructure width , but the restorations end up with an extensive and non - uniform space for porcelain application over the zirconia framework , being more prone to chipping and cracking . in the technique described in this article , \n waxing cut back was performed to obtain uniform and adequate porcelain thickness [ figure 2 ] . \n this way , substructure thickness is not uniform , but the zirconia substructure provides support for the overlying porcelain . \n the only difference to a metal ceramic substructure is that there is no palatal / lingual collar since zirconia exposure to moist environments may be detrimental to its performance . \n hence , what needs uniformity in thickness is the porcelain and not the zirconia substructure . \n a dual - scan procedure was used to combine the datasets from the die with and without the waxed substructure . \n then , the wax pattern was sealed to the die , which was scanned a second time . \n the scanner ( cercon eye ; dentsply usa ) used the sub marginal data points to orient the two scans and merge the data sets . \n it works as a subtraction of the images : the die with the waxed substructure minus the die with the tooth preparation . \n the result of this image subtraction is the personified substructure for that specific case [ figure 3 ] . \n the merged file was transmitted to a milling facility and the coping was manufactured [ figure 4 ] . \n the porcelain veneering ( cercon ceram , dentsply , usa ) was completed [ figure 5 ] and the crown cemented ( relyx unicem , 3 m espe , st . \n paul , mn , usa ) after surface treatment with sandblasting and alloy primer application . \n this procedure works as if a subtraction of the images is made : the die with the waxed substructure minus the die with the tooth preparation . and \n the result of this image subtraction is the customized framework for that specific case ready to be milled from zirconia blocks milled zirconia substructure identical to the waxed substructure ceramic crown after porcelain application \n the chipping problem is the most frequent reason for failures in all - ceramic zirconia restorations , irrespective of the zirconia veneer system applied . \n veneer fracture rates are reported at 2 - 9% for single crowns after 2 - 3 years and at 3 - 36% for fpds after 1 - 5 years . \n implant - supported zirconia - based restorations revealed even higher rates at 8% for single crowns after 6 months and at 53% for fdps after 1 year . \n impaired proprioception and rigidity of osseointegrated implants associated with higher functional loads might further aggravate cohesive veneer fractures . \n persuasive literature exists pointing to thermal processing problems as a possible cause of residual stress and defects ( too rapid heating and cooling given the very low thermal conductivity of zirconia ) . \n however , chipping seems to be a phenomena not limited to zirconia restorations and also related to the design of the substructure . \n the design of the substructure especially with the launch of cad / cam generated zirconia restorations provided no support for the veneering ceramic . \n this lack of porcelain support may have contributed to the actual high numbers of chipping on fpds as opposed to failures on the interface between substructure and veneering alone as supposed earlier . \n the lack of a uniform layer of the veneering ceramic because of improper framework design has been discussed as a possible reason for chipping fractures . \n few clinical data on optimal design of zirconia - supported restorations have been published . with the introduction of cad / cam technologies in dentistry , excessive veneer layer thickness ( > 2.5 mm ) \n was created because of the uniform layer thickness of the copings for crowns and bar - shaped connectors for fdps . \n improved customized zirconia coping design derived from the conventional porcelain fused to metal technique has been recommended to provide adequate support for the veneering ceramic . \n a dual - scan procedure of the die and full - contour wax pattern has been merged to customize the desired framework . \n preliminary in vitro studies showed that cohesive fractures within the veneering ceramic could not be avoided with the improved support , but the size of the fractures decreased significantly and failure initiated at higher loads . \n hence , the effect of framework design modifications on residual stress states needs to be better elucidated . \n it allows for the individualization of the substructures in a predictable manner and possibly improves longevity of all - ceramic crowns since core and porcelain thicknesses can be controlled . \n this technique needs to be further studied in a controlled clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of substructure modification .",
      "summary": "the use of bi - layered all - ceramic crowns has continuously grown since the introduction of computer - aided design / computer - aided manufacturing ( cad / cam ) zirconia cores . unfortunately , despite the outstanding mechanical properties of zirconia , problems related to porcelain cracking or chipping remain . \n one of the reasons for this is that ceramic copings are usually milled to uniform thicknesses of 0.3 - 0.6 mm around the whole tooth preparation . \n this may not provide uniform thickness or appropriate support for the veneering porcelain . to prevent these problems \n , the dual - scan technique demonstrates an alternative that allows the restorative team to customize zirconia cad / cam frameworks with adequate porcelain thickness and support in a simple manner .",

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Multiple sclerosis (referred to in this section as \n        ``MS'') is a progressive, disabling disease that affects the \n        brain and the spinal cord causing loss of myelin, damage to \n        axons, and cerebral atrophy.\n            (2) MS is a prime-of-life disease with an average age of \n        onset at 30 to 35 years of age.\n            (3) More than 10,000 individuals in the United States are \n        diagnosed with MS annually, and it is thought that more than \n        400,000 individuals in the United States have MS.\n            (4) Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive \n        neurological disease. The primary pathologic feature of \n        Parkinson's disease is degeneration and premature death of \n        dopamine-producing brain cells.\n            (5) Parkinson's is the second-most common neurodegenerative \n        disease in the United States.\n            (6) It is estimated that more than 1,000,000 Americans are \n        currently fighting Parkinson's disease, and 60,000 Americans \n        are newly diagnosed every year.\n            (7) Although estimates exist, there is no confirmed data \n        regarding prevalence or diagnosed cases of Parkinson's disease \n        or MS.\n            (8) The causes of Parkinson's disease and MS are not well \n        understood.\n            (9) There is no known cure for Parkinson's disease or MS.\n            (10) Studies have found relationships between both MS and \n        Parkinson's disease and environmental and genetic factors, but \n        those relationships are not well understood.\n            (11) Better data are needed to understand the economic \n        impact of Parkinson's disease, MS, and other neurological \n        diseases.\n            (12) There are several drugs currently approved by the Food \n        and Drug Administration for the treatment of MS, which have \n        shown modest success in reducing relapses, slowing progression \n        of disability, and limiting the accumulation of brain lesions.\n            (13) Currently, state-of-the-art treatment for Parkinson's \n        disease is based on a 40-year-old pharmaceutical therapy, which \n        only treats some of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. \n        Deep brain stimulation surgery is available for certain \n        patients and treats some symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n            (14) No therapies exist that will slow or stop progression \n        of Parkinson's disease. There is no effective, lasting therapy \n        for all features of Parkinson's disease.\n            (15) Central nervous system drugs, including therapies for \n        MS, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological diseases, are \n        the slowest in the drug development pipeline, taking an average \n        of 15 years post discovery for new therapies to reach the \n        market.\n            (16) Several small and uncoordinated MS and Parkinson's \n        disease registries, surveillance systems, and databases exist \n        in the United States and throughout the world.\n            (17) A single national system to collect and store \n        information on the incidence and prevalence of MS, Parkinson's \n        disease, or other neurological diseases in the United States \n        does not exist.\n            (18) The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry \n        (ATSDR) has established a series of small pilot studies, \n        beginning in fiscal year 2006, to evaluate the feasibility of \n        various methodologies to create an MS surveillance system at \n        the national level.\n            (19) The national surveillance system methodology resulting \n        from the MS pilot studies should be expanded upon and developed \n        into a national surveillance system for Parkinson's disease.\n            (20) The establishment of separate, coordinated national \n        surveillance systems for Parkinson's disease and MS will help--\n                    (A) to identify the incidence and prevalence of \n                these diseases in the United States;\n                    (B) to collect demographic and other data important \n                to the study of MS and Parkinson's disease;\n                    (C) to produce epidemiologically sound data that \n                can be used to compare with cluster information, data \n                sets of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n                environmental exposure data, and other information;\n                    (D) to promote a better understanding of causes, \n                prevention, and treatment of disease;\n                    (E) to better understand public and private \n                resource impact;\n                    (F) to collect information that is important for \n                research into genetic and environmental risk factors;\n                    (G) to enhance biomedical and clinical research by \n                providing a basis for population comparisons;\n                    (H) to enhance efforts to develop better diagnosis \n                and progression biomarkers for MS and Parkinson's \n                disease; and\n                    (I) to enhance efforts to find treatments and a \n                cure for MS and Parkinson's disease.\n\nSEC. 3.

consequently alter enzyme activities ; corrupt cell membranes ; and damage transport systems ( 7 ) . \n the membrane lipid peroxidation due to an increase in free radicals or decrease in activities of antioxidant defense mechanisms has been suggested to be causally involved in some forms of epilepsy ( 7 ) . on the other hand , malondialdehyde ( mda ) values , \n an indicator of membrane lipid peroxidation , were found to be unchanged in children with epilepsy ( 8) . oxidative stress index ( 9 ) is reported as a valuable parameter indicating oxidative stress level . \n furthermore , previously conducted studies revealed that oxidative stress index ( osi ) rate indicates oxidative injury , as well ( 10 - 12 ) . \n total antioxidative status ( tas ) determines the balance between the oxidative stress and antioxidant status . \n measurement of total antioxidant capacity reflects the cumulative effect of antioxidants of plasma and body ( 13 ) . \n therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidative and antioxidative status in cbz - treated epileptic children to improve the data regarding the connection between cbz treatment and oxidative stress . \n the study is composed of 40 epileptic children ( 22 males , 18 females ) and 31 healthy children ( 17 males , 14 females ) , with an age range between 4 and 12 years . \n all randomized subjects were selected from those who visited relating departments of mustafa kemal university faculty of medicine and antakya state hospital for checkup or medical treatment . \n patients that were included in the study were chosen among those with epileptic seizures receiving cbz treatment for 1 year . \n the patients with systemic diseases ( malignancy , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , autoimmune diseases , cardiac , metabolic , and central nerve ischemia ) , who use systemic and/or local corticosteroids were excluded . \n serum cbz level was assessed using a biochemical auto analyzer ( architect c8000 clinical chemistry analyzer , abbott , u.s . , \n japan ) . total oxidative status ( tos ) ( 9 ) and tas of serum was determined using a novel automated measurement method developed by erel ( 10 , 11 ) . \n oxidants present in the sample oxidize the ferrous ion - o - dianisidine complex to ferric ion . \n the oxidation reaction is enhanced by glycerol molecules , which are abundantly present in the reaction medium \n . the percent ratio of tos to tas yields the osi , an indicator of the degree of oxidative stress ( 14 ) . \n percent rate of tos level to tas level was accepted as osi ( 15 ) . to apply the calculation , the result unit of tas , mmol trolox equivalent / l , \n was changed to mmol trolox equivalent / l and the osi value was calculated using following formula : analysis of obtained data was performed using spss 13.0 for windows , a statistical software package . \n pearson correlation test was used for the correlation between blood cbz level and blood tos value . \n correlation coefficient ( r ) and significance values ( p ) was determined . a p value of < 0.05 was accepted as significant . \n serum cbz level was assessed using a biochemical auto analyzer ( architect c8000 clinical chemistry analyzer , abbott , u.s . , \n japan ) . total oxidative status ( tos ) ( 9 ) and tas of serum was determined using a novel automated measurement method developed by erel ( 10 , 11 ) . \n oxidants present in the sample oxidize the ferrous ion - o - dianisidine complex to ferric ion . \n the oxidation reaction is enhanced by glycerol molecules , which are abundantly present in the reaction medium . \n the percent ratio of tos to tas yields the osi , an indicator of the degree of oxidative stress ( 14 ) . \n percent rate of tos level to tas level was accepted as osi ( 15 ) . to apply the calculation , the result unit of tas , mmol trolox equivalent / l , \n was changed to mmol trolox equivalent / l and the osi value was calculated using following formula : \n analysis of obtained data was performed using spss 13.0 for windows , a statistical software package . \n pearson correlation test was used for the correlation between blood cbz level and blood tos value . \n correlation coefficient ( r ) and significance values ( p ) was determined . a p value of < 0.05 was accepted as significant . \n tas , tos and osi levels of each group were compared , and statistically significant differences observed . \n tas levels of cbz treated group were significantly lower compared to those of the control group ( p < 0.0001 ) . \n conversely , tos and osi levels were found to be significantly higher in cbz treated group ( p < 0.004 and p < 0.0001 , respectively ) ( table 1 ) . in cbz \n treated epileptic patients group , correlation between blood cbz level and tas - tos levels was examined . \n a positive correlation was found between cbz and tos levels ( r = 0.472 , p < 0.01 ) ( figure 1 ) . \n abbreviations : cbz , carbamazepine ; osi , oxidative stress index ; tas , total antioxidant status ; tos , total oxidant status . cbz : carbamazepine ; tos : total oxidant status . \n our study showed that cbz treatment increased oxidative stress in patients with epilepsy . in the literature , there is a limited number of clinical case studies investigating the relation between oxidative stress and cbz treatment in patients with epilepsy ( 16 - 20 ) . \n secondly , we firstly evaluated the relationship between oxidative stress and cbz treatment with tas , tos and osi measurement in epileptic patients . \n li et al . ( 21 ) investigated the effects of cbz on the oxidative stress of common carp spermatozoa in vitro . \n they reported that the oxidative stress was apparent and the significant inhibition of antioxidant enzymes activities including superoxide dismutase ( sod ) and glutathione peroxidase ( gsh - px ) after 2 hours exposure of cbz at higher concentration ( 2.0 or 20 mg / l ) . \n their results suggested that cbz can induce reactive oxygen species ( 20 ) stress and could impair the antioxidant defense system . \n li et al . ( 22 ) also investigated the effect of long - term exposure to cbz on the antioxidant system in brain tissue of rainbow trout . \n the fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of cbz ( 1.0 g / l , 0.2 mg / l or 2.0 mg / l ) for 7 , 21 , and 42 days . \n crz exposure at 0.2 mg / l led to significant increases of oxidative stress indices after 42 days and , at 2.0 mg / l , after 21 days . \n activities of the antioxidant enzymes including sod , cat , and gpx in cbz - treated groups slightly increased during the first period ( 7 days ) . \n however , activities of antioxidant enzymes were significantly inhibited at 0.2 mg / l exposure after 42 days and after 21 days at 2.0 mg / l . after 42 days , the content of glutathione ( gsh ) in fish brain was significantly lower in groups exposed to cbz at 0.2 mg / l and 2.0 mg / l . \n prolonged exposure to cbz resulted in excess reactive oxygen species formation , finally resulting in oxidative damage to lipids and proteins and inhibited antioxidant capacities in fish brain . \n the authors emphasized that a low level of oxidative stress could induce the adaptive responses of antioxidant enzymes , but long - term exposure to cbz could lead to serious oxidative damage in fish brain . \n oxidative stress is the condition with an imbalance between generation and elimination of ros and reactive nitrogen species , creating the potential for organic damage . \n oxidative stress is blamed for the pathogenesis of epilepsy as a potential mechanism ( 23 ) . \n several studies on animal models and genetic studies have demonstrated an increase in mitochondrial oxidative stress and subsequent cell damage after persistent seizures ( 24 - 26 ) . \n it has been reported that the increased amount of active oxygen metabolites or reduced activity of antioxidative defense mechanisms may cause greater frequency of seizure ( 7 , 27 ) . \n the role of antioxidant action in the effect of antiepileptic drugs ( aeds ) is controversial . hamed and abdellah ( 28 ) reviewed the relation between membrane lipid peroxidation , antioxidants , neuronal excitotoxicity , and aeds . \n the authors identified that cbz was found to be a better anti - epileptic for the control of free radical - related seizures . on the other hand , solowiej ( 29 ) reported that sod activity decreased , gsh - px , glutathione disulfide ( gssg - r ) activities and mda level increased in the serum of children and adolescents with epilepsy . according niketic ( 30 ) , \n the activity of antioxidant enzymes were decreased by 40% in epileptic children on cbz compared to healthy individuals . however , increased tos was observed in the same study . \n certain studies noted that phenytoin ( 31 ) and valproic acid treatment ( 32 ) increase lipid peroxidation in epileptic children . increased tos and decreased tas \n oxidative damage caused by cbz was revealed by some previously conducted studies ( 16 , 17 ) . \n different from the literature , our findings are based on tas , tos and osi measurements for the first time . therefore , we discussed our results in the light of related literature . \n both the role of antioxidant action in epilepsy pathogenesis and the effect of aeds , particularly cbz , on the oxidant - antioxidant status in epilepsy patients are controversial \n . this could be due to complex pathogenic mechanisms of epilepsy and methodological issues . yet \n oxidative stress may originate from various sources in the body and peripheral measurements might not necessarily accurately reflect the oxidative stress in the central nervous system . \n another contribution of our study is that the relationship between the cbz levels and oxidative damage was firstly evaluated in the present study . \n this finding might be an explanation for oxidative damage secondary to cbz treatment , and for efficacy of antioxidants ( 17 ) . \n epilepsy has a multifactorial mechanism and it is difficult to isolate a single cause of the disease . \n therefore the mechanism of action of aeds could not be fully understood yet . based on our results \n , antioxidant mechanism could not be playing any role in antiepileptic effect of cbz . furthermore , increased oxidative stress induced by cbz could be the cause of carbamazepine - induced seizures , a complication of cbz treatment .",
      "summary": "background : there is an increasing attention towards the relationship between oxidative stress and epilepsy . \n the effect of antiepileptic drugs on oxidant status is of major interest . \n antiepileptic drugs can increase levels of free radicals , which consequently might lead to seizures . \n carbamazepine ( cbz ) is an antiepileptic drug commonly used in childhood and adolescence.objectives:therefore we aimed to investigate the effects of cbz on total antioxidant status , total oxidant stress , and oxidative stress index.patients and methods : the study included 40 epileptic patients and 31 healthy children between 4 and 12 years of age . \n serum cbz level , total antioxidant capacity and total oxidant status were measured . \n oxidative stress index was also calculated both in controls and patients.results:in the epileptic group , decreased levels of total antioxidant capacity , increased total oxidative stress and oxidative stress index levels were found . \n positive correlation between plasma cbz levels and total oxidant status was observed.conclusions:antioxidant action could not be playing any role in antiepileptic effect of cbz . \n furthermore , increased oxidative stress induced by cbz could be the cause of cbz - induced seizures . \n therefore combining cbz with antioxidants could be beneficial .",

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since the collapse of the Siad Barre regime in 1991, \n        Somalia has struggled to rebuild a government and assert order \n        and control over warlords, clan militias, and extremist groups.\n            (2) The lack of functioning state and governing structures \n        led to chronic humanitarian need within Somalia and enabled \n        terrorist groups, maritime crime, illicit trafficking, and mass \n        refugee flows to flourish.\n            (3) In 2007, the Ethiopian military ousted the Islamic \n        Courts Union and the United Nations authorized the African \n        Union to deploy a peacekeeping force to Somalia, the African \n        Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), in order to support the \n        Transitional Federal Government to establish order in Somalia. \n        AMISOM currently consists of troops from Burundi, Djibouti, \n        Kenya, Sierra Leone, and Uganda.\n            (4) In 2008, Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen (al-Shabaab) \n        was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially \n        Designated Global Terrorist entity by the United States \n        Government.\n            (5) In 2010, al-Shabaab took control of southern and \n        central Somalia and instituted strict Sharia law.\n            (6) In July 2010, Al-Shabaab retaliated against a \n        contributor to AMISOM by carrying out an attack in Kampala, \n        Uganda, which killed 74 people and injured 70 others.\n            (7) In 2010, in response to growing al-Shabaab dominance \n        and brutality, the AMISOM mandate was expanded to directly \n        target and counter al-Shabaab in Somalia.\n            (8) In 2011 and 2012, when many parts of the country were \n        suffering from severe food insecurity and famine, al-Shabaab \n        denied humanitarian access to its residents, resulting in the \n        death of close to 260,000 people and acute food insecurity for \n        millions.\n            (9) In 2011, the Kenyan Defense Force joined AMISOM, to \n        help take control of urban areas like Mogadishu and Kismayo \n        from al-Shabaab control.\n            (10) In 2012, improved security in much of urban Somalia \n        enabled the Transitional Federal Government to complete a draft \n        constitution and end its transitional term.\n            (11) In 2012, a regionally representative Somali \n        constituent assembly elected a new Federal parliament, which in \n        turn elected President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.\n            (12) The United States, Arab and European countries, the \n        United Nations, and the African Union officially recognized the \n        new Somali government, citing the process that created it as \n        being the most credible and inclusive process to date.\n            (13) On March 6, 2013, the United Nations Security Council \n        passed Resolution 2093, creating a new exemption to the 21-\n        year-old arms embargo for a period of 12 months, to allow for \n        ``deliveries of weapons or military equipment or the provision \n        of advice, assistance or training, intended solely for the \n        development of the National Security Forces of the Federal \n        Government of Somalia'', and calling for the training, \n        equipping, and capacity-building of Somali Security Forces, \n        including both its armed forces and police, with special focus \n        on the development of infrastructure to ``ensure the safe \n        storage, registration, maintenance and distribution of military \n        equipment,'' and ``procedures and codes of conduct . . . for \n        the registration, distribution, use, and storage of weapons''.\n            (14) On May 2, 2013, the United National Security Council \n        passed Resolution 2102, establishing the United Nations \n        Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) under the leadership of a \n        Special Representative of the Secretary-General to support the \n        Government of Somalia with peace-building, state-building and \n        governance, as well as the coordination of international \n        assistance.\n            (15) Though greeted with great optimism, the Government of \n        Somalia has run into many challenges, which has stalled its \n        efforts to finalize the constitution, guide the structure of \n        the new state, or provide services to the population.\n            (16) President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and his government \n        have committed to the completion of these tasks and to holding \n        a constitutional referendum and national election by 2016.\n            (17) On September 16, 2013, the international community and \n        a high level Somali delegation endorsed a compact based on the \n        ``New Deal Strategy for Engagement in Fragile States.'' Donors \n        pledged $2,400,000,000 over three years to support Somali \n        development priorities, including $69,000,000 from the United \n        States.\n            (18) Al Shabaab continues to use terrorist tactics to \n        attack soft targets.

Done deal? pic.twitter.com/4FhqMhsSTD\n\nEarlier this week it had been suggested Solskjaer, 40, had reservations about taking the job after Tan's numerous disputes with Mackay over recent months. But Dalman remained confident he could convince the Norwegian to take over at Cardiff City Stadium, with the promise of money to spend in the January transfer window and reassurances over the working structure at the club.\n\nSolskjaer has enjoyed a successful spell in charge of Molde, guiding them to two Norwegian titles and a Norwegian Cup. He turned down the chance to become Aston Villa manager prior to the appointment of Paul Lambert at Villa Park, while he had also been linked with the current vacancy at West Bromwich Albion.\n\nTan was not initially due to attend Wednesday's game, but it had been reported he and Solskjaer had agreed a deal in Norway before flying into London to watch the fixture together.\n\nIf Solskjaer takes the job his first game in charge would be the FA Cup tie away to Newcastle on Saturday.",

1 ) eplbd should be avoided in patients with distal cbd strictures ; 2 ) full est should be avoided immediately before eplbd ; 3 ) the balloon should be inflated gradually ; 4 ) inflation should be discontinued in cases of persistent balloon waist ( 75% rule ) ; 5 ) not to be inflated beyond the maximum diameter of the dilated cbd ; and 6 ) convert to an alternative stone removal or drainage method any time there is difficulty in removing the stone . \n because it was multicenter study analyzing the safety of eplbd based on large numbers of cases , experienced experts will agree with the above referred recommendations , though it was studied retrospectively . \n kahaleh and freeman2 recently made recommendations to minimize risks of ercp in international digestive endoscopy network ( iden ) 2012 as follows ;

direct visualization system , natick , ma , usa ) may offer an interesting compromise in terms of size ( 10 fr diameter ) and complexity of use . \n soc is challenged by the size of the biopsy obtained and the stiffness of the forceps ( spybite ; boston scientific , natick , ma , usa ) fitting within the working channel of the system . \n sensitivity of forceps biopsy through the cholangioscope was far higher for intrinsic ( 66% ) than extrinsic ( 8% ) malignant lesions . conclusively , spyglass ( direct visualization system ) has not only been used as a platform for advanced intraductal imaging with probe based endomicroscopy and spyglass - guided stone fragmentation ; but also for photodynamic therapy to treat bile duct cancer . \n soc can be a great step to realize intraductal visualization as well as therapy , but the best is yet to come . \n pancreatobiliary endoscopy is continuously evolving area with new techniques and we attempt to optimize the postprocedural outcomes .",

      "document": "the immunosuppressive receptor pd-1 and its ligand pd - l1 have been identified by dr . \n tasuku honjo and his colleagues at the kyoto university as factors that \n induce programmed cell death . \n since the mechanism mediated by pd-1 and its ligand was shown to be important for immune \n suppression and tolerance , it has also been reported to be involved in pathogenetic mechanisms of various diseases . \n pd-1 and pd - l1 are single - pass transmembrane molecules expressed on the cell surface , which belong to the b7 family . their expression is induced by \n immune - activating stimuli and is understood as a negative feedback mechanism to suppress excessive immune reactions and let immune responses cease . \n when the \n receptor pd-1 is bound by its ligand , src homology 2-domain - containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 ( shp-2 ) and shp-1 are recruited to immunoreceptor tyrosine - based \n inhibitory motif and immunoreceptor tyrosine - based switch motif in the intracellular region of pd-1 and suppress antigen receptor signaling mediators . \n this process results in reduced production of cytokines , such as interferon ( ifn)- and interleukin ( il)-2 , reduced cell \n proliferation and suppressed immune cell activation . in addition to the close involvement in homeostasis of the living body as summarized above , recent studies \n have shown that immunosuppressive factors , pd-1 and pd - l1 , are also involved in immunosuppression in cases of tumors and chronic infections . while generally not \n highly expressed in normal tissues , pd - l1 is expressed at a high rate in tumor tissues in melanoma , lung cancer , colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer , and has \n been demonstrated to be involved in immune evasion by tumors . in patients with renal cell cancer and gastric cancer , \n pd - l1 has been shown to be an important prognostic determinant ; also , the disease progression is faster , and the mortality is higher in patients with tumors \n expressing pd - l1 than in patients without detectable pd - l1 expression [ 51 , 53 ] . in \n addition , pd - l1 expression has also been reported for other tumors including breast cancer , pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer , and pd-1 expression in \n tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes has been confirmed in many types of tumors including melanoma , lung cancer and intrahepatic bile duct cancer . \n these findings have \n revealed the importance of the pd-1/pd - l1 pathway as an immunosuppression mechanism in a variety of tumors . based on the series of studies on pd-1/pd - l1 in tumor \n diseases , therapeutic means targeting this pathway are being developed . \n specifically , these new therapeutics are biopharmaceuticals based on anti - pd-1 antibodies , \n anti - pd - l1 antibodies or recombinant proteins that inhibit the pd-1/pd - l1 pathway . \n these biopharmaceuticals have been reported to show good anti - tumor effects \n regardless of the tumor type and are attracting growing attention as a new , promising class of anti - tumor therapy . \n fully humanized anti - pd-1 and anti - pd - l1 \n antibodies have already been produced and are actively tested as therapeutic agents in clinical studies ( trials ) , with good anti - tumor effects continuing to be \n reported in patients with melanoma , lung cancer , renal cell cancer and some other types of cancer . in melanoma , which has a very poor prognosis , clinical trials \n conducted in japan and the united states have reported not only the suppressed growth of cancer cells , but also complete remission in some cases . on september , \n 2014 , the anti - pd-1 antibody \n was finally released by ono pharmaceutical as a new anti - tumor therapeutic agent , and it has become a pioneer \n for innovative immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ono pharmaceutical : https://www.opdivo.jp/contents/action/ ) . \n this immune checkpoint - targeted immunotherapy was \n selected as  breakthrough of the year 2013  by the journal science as a global revolutionary technology . currently , merck , roche and other major pharmaceutical \n companies around the world are accelerating their efforts to develop similar antibody - based drugs ; this class of therapeutics is gaining so much momentum and \n attention that the conventional concept of anti - tumor therapy is being overturned . \n the causative factors of bovine leukemia can be divided \n into viral and non - viral . \n non - viral bovine leukemia is sporadic and can be subdivided into calf type , thymic type and cutaneous type involving unknown causes . \n on \n the other hand , enzootic bovine leukemia , which is caused by blv , accounts for the vast majority of cases of bovine leukemia , and its prevalence continues to \n increase . \n blv infections are latent in the aleukemic ( al ) state , but can emerge as persistent lymphocystosis ( pl ) with non - malignant polyclonal expansion of \n cd5 b - cells that predominantly harbor blv provirus and rarely as malignant b - cell lymphoma in various lymph nodes after long periods of latency \n . \n the progression of enzootic bovine leukemia is accompanied by marked suppression of cell - mediated immunity [ 8 , 9 , 16 ] , and as the pathogenetic mechanism \n remains unknown , there are no effective vaccines or therapeutic methods available , meaning that affected animals eventually die . \n bovine leukemia was designated as \n a communicable disease obligated to notify under the act on domestic animal infectious diseases control when it was revised in 1997 . in 2015 , \n 2,896 cases of \n bovine leukemia were reported ( of which the largest number of 494 cases occurred in hokkaido ) , representing the disease reported in a greater number than any \n other bovine disease required to monitor by the act ( http://www.maff.go.jp/j/syouan/douei/kansi_densen/kansi_densen.html ) . \n this number is 29.3-fold the number of \n cases reported in 1998 ( 96 affected animals ) , indicating that the increase has not yet been halted . \n requests for urgent measures against this disease have been \n voiced very frequently by people practicing veterinary medicine and animal husbandry . however , a large - scale survey conducted by the national institute of animal \n health using specimens collected from 2009 to 2011 showed an approximate blv - positive rate of 35% , demonstrating the difficulty of implementing any project to \n select and replace infected cattle . \n comparative analyses of blv - infected cattle by clinical condition have suggested that animals with a high viral load and persistent lymphocytosis are at a high \n risk of disease onset , often serving as infection sources , have a high risk of vertical transmission   and have increased levels of cd4cd25foxp3 treg cells , showing increased susceptibility \n to opportunistic infections due to transforming growth factor - beta produced by treg cells , which reduces the production of interferon - gamma and tumor necrosis \n factor - alpha by cd4 t cells and impairs cellular immunity mediated mainly by the cytotoxic activity of nk cells [ 28 , 48 ] . \n moreover , the proliferative ability of lymphocytes in response to blv was also significantly reduced in \n cattle with persistent lymphocytosis , and lymphocytes were found to produce reduced levels of anti - viral cytokines , such as ifn- , il-2 and il-12 [ 13 , 18 ] . therefore , we analyzed the expression of pd-1 and its ligand , pd - l1 . \n results \n showed that the pd-1 expression in cd4 and cd8 cells and the pd - l1 expression in virus - infected b cells increase as the disease \n progresses . \n furthermore , pd - l1 expression negatively correlated with the ifn- expression level , an indicator of immunosuppression , while positively correlating \n with leukocyte count , virus titer and provirus level . antibodies to bovine pd-1 and pd - l1 were established , and the results from pd-1 and pd - l1 binding inhibition \n assays confirmed that they activated anti - viral immunity and that the increase in ifn- production positively correlated with the pd-1 expression rate on \n cd4 t cells . and also , recombinant bovine pd - l2 ( pd - l2-ig ) significantly enhanced ifn- production from virus antigens - stimulated pbmcs derived from \n blv - infected cattle . \n interestingly , the pd - l2-ig - induced ifn- production was further enhanced by treatment with anti - bovine pd-1 antibody . \n these results indicated that the pd-1/pd - l pathway constitutes a part of the immunosuppressive mechanism in bovine leukemia ( table 2table 2.change of immune inhibitory molecules in the cause of bovine leukemia virus infectionreceptor / liganduninfectedinfected(disease status)referencesalpllymphomapd-1/pd - l1///// lag-3/mhcclass ii////n.d [ 17 , 41]tim-3/gal-9///// ctla-4/cd80 , cd86/n.d/n.d/n.d/n.dn.d n.d : not demonstrated . ) \n we also analyzed immunosuppressive receptors other than the pd-1/pd - l1 pathway , \n such as lymphocyte - activation gene 3 ( lag-3 ) [ 17 , 41 ] , t - cell immunoglobulin and \n mucin domain - containing protein 3 ( tim-3 ) , and cytotoxic t - lymphocyte antigen 4 ( ctla-4 ; cd152 )   expressed in antigen - specific lymphocytes and found that expression levels of lag-3 , tim-3 , ctla-4 and their ligands on lymphocytes \n increased as the disease progressed and anti - viral immunity was activated in binding inhibition assays , as was the case for pd-1 ( table 2 ) . \n currently , clinical studies of these drugs are being carried out at the hokkaido university and other institutions . \n although there are many diseases in cattle involving immune abnormalities ( impairments ) , the mechanisms underlying these diseases remain unknown . \n our previous \n analyses have shown that immunosuppressive factors , such as pd - l1 , are also involved in immune suppression seen in diseases other than bovine leukemia , namely \n johne s disease   and bovine anaplasmosis . \n furthermore , recent evidence \n suggests that immunosuppressive factors , such as pd-1 , are involved in the reduced immune function in chronic infectious diseases , such as mastitis , bovine \n mycoplasmosis and bovine tuberculosis ( manuscript in preparation ) . \n our laboratory has been working on the development of a blv vaccine for many years . \n it is based \n on a vaccine antigen that was found to be promising in in vitro studies . however , although we tried various procedures , the vaccine did not \n prevent infection or even disease onset despite the fact that effector cells were present in vivo ( data not shown ) . \n results from the present \n analysis suggested that the virus s immune evasion mechanism for lymphocyte exhaustion might be related to the ineffectiveness of the vaccine . \n future measures \n against chronic infectious diseases will require the development of a new , pre - emptive control method that targets this formidable immune evasion mechanism . to \n achieve this goal , \n results from more detailed analyses of immune exhaustion in other chronic infections are awaited . for use in humans , several immune \n checkpoint - targeting biopharmaceuticals \n have been successively developed , including those described above , and they are being actively tested in clinical trials . \n in the future , it is anticipated that they will be applied to veterinary medicine and animal husbandry , including diseases in cattle .",
      "summary": "recently , dysfunction of antigen - specific t cells is well documented as t - cell exhaustion and has been defined by the loss of effector functions during chronic \n infections and cancer in human . \n the exhausted t cells are characterized phenotypically by the surface expression of immunoinhibitory receptors , such as \n programmed death 1 ( pd-1 ) , lymphocyte activation gene 3 ( lag-3 ) , t - cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain - containing protein 3 ( tim-3 ) and cytotoxic t - lymphocyte \n antigen 4 ( ctla-4 ) . \n however , there is still a fundamental lack of knowledge about the immunoinhibitory receptors in the fields of veterinary medicine . in \n particular , very little is known about mechanism of t cell dysfunction in chronic infection in cattle . \n recent our studies have revealed that immunoinhibitory \n molecules including pd-1/ programmed death - ligand 1 ( pd - l1 ) play critical roles in immune exhaustion and disease progression in case of bovine leukemia virus \n ( blv ) infection , johne s disease and bovine anaplasmosis . \n this review includes some recent data from us .",

      "document": "a sandwich or laminate technique is one of the methods proposed for composite resin restorations , which was introduced for the first time by mclean , et al . in 1985 . the basic idea behind this technique is to use two different restorative materials for a single restorative procedure so that the maximum physico - mechanical and esthetic properties of these two materials can be exploited simultaneously . \n generally , the first component is a layer of conventional or resin - modified glass - ionomer cement which has drawn attention due to its capacity to form an inherent bond with tooth structures and the resultant better seal and decrease in microleakage ( particularly in dentinal walls ) ; it can also release fluoride and decrease the odds of carious lesions . \n the second component is a layer of composite materials ( including composite resin , compomer , and ormocer ) , which is used to compensate for the limitations and disadvantages of glass - ionomer cements , including weak mechanical properties and inappropriate esthetic appearance . \n it has been reported that the combination of these two materials have different property results in the clinical success of restorations . \n the success of the laminate technique depends on the strength of the bond between the glass - ionomer and the resin composite materials in addition to the strength of the bond between the glass - ionomer cement and dentin . however , there is a relatively weak bond strength between conventional glass - ionomers and composite resin materials , mainly because of the lack of a chemical bond between these two materials and the low cohesive strength of glass - ionomer.[35 ] several studies have evaluated different surface preparation techniques for glass - ionomers , such as the use of different bonding systems and surface etching procedures in order to increase the bond strength between these two materials in the laminate technique . \n etching the surface with phosphoric acid has yielded different results . in a study carried out by sheth , et al . etching the surface of glass - ionomer had no effect on bond strength increase ; however , an increase in bond strength after acid etching has been reported in another study . \n it has also been reported that premature etching of glass - ionomer cement ( before its initial setting reaction ) and failure to use an adhesive resin between the glass - ionomer cement and composite resin increases the odds of restoration failure . in another study , it was demonstrated that the use of a self - etch adhesive system on half - set glass - ionomer cement ( before its initial setting ) increases the bond strength between the glass - ionomer cement and composite resin more than that observed with the use of total - etch systems ( its application after the initial setting of the cement ) . \n it has also been reported that the use of a glass - ionomer - based adhesive system applied after the cement 's initial setting improves the bond strength between the glass - ionomer cement and composite resin compared to that with the use of total - etch adhesive systems under similar conditions . \n a new group of composite resin materials , giomers , have been introduced in less than a decade , which consist of reacted glass - ionomer fillers in a resin matrix ; they are used in cavities in a manner similar to composite resins with the application of an adhesive system . in addition to appropriate esthetic results , easy polishing , fluoride recharging potential and strength , these materials release fluoride which may enhance their antibacterial effects . \n however , no studies to date have evaluated the bond strength between glass - ionomers and giomers ; therefore , the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three surface preparation methods on the shear bond strength of giomer to different surface treated conventional glass - ionomer . \n sixty cylindrical specimens were used in the present in vitro study . in order to prepare the samples , \n a plastic mold ( with an inner diameter of 6 mm and a height of 4 mm ) was placed on a glass slab . \n then conventional glass - ionomer ( gc fuji ii , gc corporation , tokyo , japan ) was packed into the plastic mold after mixing according to the manufacturer 's instructions . \n another glass slide was used on the other side of the mold to make the free surface of the conventional glass - ionomer smooth . \n then the samples were randomly divided into three groups of 20 . according to the manufacturer \n , the initial setting of gc fuji ii conventional glass - ionomer lasts in 5 minutes and a half , and the net setting time is 2 minutes and a half . \n three groups were compared ; a total - etch adhesive resin or a self - etch giomer - based adhesive resin on set glass - ionomer ; or the self - etch giomer - based adhesive resin on the unset glass - ionomer ( before completion of the initial setting ) . in group 1 the surfaces of the specimens were etched with 37% phosphoric acid ( 3 m espe dental products , st . \n paul , mn , usa ) for 15 seconds after 5 minutes and 30 seconds from the mixing procedure ; the initial setting reaction was confirmed with the use of a sharp dental explorer . \n it should be pointed out that a complete setting of conventional glass - ionomer takes 24 - 72 hours . \n after surface etching , a single bond total - etch adhesive system ( 3 m espe dental products , st . \n paul , mn , usa ) was applied according to the manufacturer 's instructions and light cured [ table 1 ] . \n a second transparent mold , with a diameter of 3 mm and a height of 2 mm , was placed on the conventional glass - ionomer specimen and a giomer restorative , beautifil ii a3-shade ( shofu dental corporation , osaka , japan ) , was packed into the transparent mold and cured using a halogen light - curing unit ( astralis 7 ; ivoclar vivadent , fl-9494 schaan , liechtenstein ) . \n the light - directing probe had a diameter of 8 mm and directed a light ray at an intensity of 700 mw / cm perpendicular to the surface , barely touching the surface , for 40 seconds . a light intensity of 700 mw / cm was confirmed using a radiometer before the start of each experimental session . \n after transparent mold removal , the specimens were cured for another 20 seconds from each direction . \n then the samples were kept in humidity chamber at 37c for 1 hour before being immersed in distilled water at 37c for the next 23 hours . in the next stage , \n a 500-cycle thermocycling procedure was carried out at 5c/55c  5c with a dwell time of 30 seconds and a transfer time of 10 seconds . \n chemical composition and application mode of adhesives used in group 2 , the procedures were similar to those in group 1 except that fl - bond ii ( shofu dental corporation , osaka , japan ) self - etch adhesive resin was used on set glass - ionomer surface according to the manufacturer 's instructions and light cured [ table 1 ] , without acid etching . in group 3 , \n all the procedures were similar to those in group 2 except that fl - bond ii adhesive was applied according to the manufacturer 's instructions right after the initial setting and before hardening of glass - ionomer ( 2 minutes and a half after the initiation of mixing , which is equal to the cement 's net setting time ) . \n it should be pointed out that during that time the surface hardness of the cement was sufficient to place the second mold without damaging the cement . in order to measure the shear bond strength , \n the samples were mounted in cold - cured acrylic resin from the glass - ionomer side and the shear bond strength values of the samples were measured in newton using a universal testing machine ( h5k - s model , hounsfield test equipment , surrey , uk ) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm / min using a 0.5 mm - wide chisel . \n then the shear bond strength values were calculated in mpa by dividing the force ( in newton ) by the surface area ( mm ) of the samples . \n data were analyzed by one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) and pairwise comparisons were made by a tukey test using spss/ win.15 . \n the failure modes were determined under a stereomicroscope ( smz1500 , nikon , tokyo , japan ) at 20 . \n the failure modes were classified as follows : adhesive failure : failure at giomer  glass  ionomer cement interface . \n in addition , to evaluate the interface between the conventional glass - ionomer and giomer in the groups under study , two additional specimens were prepared in each group and subsequent to longitudinal sectioning , they were evaluated under an scanning electron microscope [ sem ] ( tescan , vega ii xmu , brno , czech republic ) [ figure 1 ] . \n scanning electron micrographs of conventional glass - ionomer and giomer interface in the study groups ( mag 500 ) . \n arrows indicate margins of adhesive resin between glass - ionomer and giomer . in the three scanning electron micrographs , \n the materials which are placed on the right and left sides of the adhesive resin indicate glass - ionomer and giomer , respectively \n shear bond strengths in mpa ( means and standard deviations ) for the study groups are represented in table 2 . \n there were statistically significant differences in shear bond strength values between the study groups ( p < 0.0005 ) . \n pairwise comparisons by a tukey test revealed that there were statistically significant differences in shear bond strengths between group 2 and the two other groups ( p < 0.0005 ) , whereas the bond strength difference between groups 1 and 3 was not statistically significant ( p = 0.609 ) . means and standard deviations ( sd ) of the shear bond strengths ( mpa ) measured in study groups \n moreover , all the cohesive failures were within glass - ionomer cement and there were no cohesive failures inside the giomer . \n failure modes of the study groups sem photomicrographs of the glass - ionomer and giomer interface in the study groups are represented in figure 1 . in the sem photomicrograph in group 1 \n [ figure 1a ] the hybrid zone ( the area of adhesive resin penetration into glass - ionomer ) is almost homogeneous but has irregular borders on the glass - ionomer cement side . in the sem photomicrograph in group 2 \n [ figure 1b ] the hybrid zone is regular and homogenous and in the sem photomicrograph in group 3 [ figure 1c ] the hybrid zone is irregular and non - homogenous . \n moreover , the use of self - etch adhesive resin ( fl - bond ii ) in groups 2 and 3 resulted in the thicker hybrid zone than total - etch adhesive resin ( single bond ) in group 1 . \n an appropriate bond between glass - ionomer and the superficial resin materials is very important for the success of the sandwich technique . in the present study shear bond strength of conventional glass - ionomer to giomer \n was evaluated using three different surface preparations for glass - ionomer ( use of self - etch adhesive on glass - ionomer with or without complete initial setting reaction and use of total - etch adhesive on glass - ionomer after completion of the initial setting reaction ) . in designing the present study , \n the use of total - etch adhesive on glass - ionomer without the completion of the initial setting reaction was not considered , because in total - etch adhesives , rinsing after etching and contamination with moisture before completion of the initial setting reaction of glass - ionomer influences the surface integrity of the cement . \n the results of the present study showed that shear bond strength of glass - ionomer to giomer depends on surface preparation . in this context , in the group in which glass - ionomer was set and self - etch adhesive was used , the highest shear bond strength was recorded compared to two other groups , which is consistent with the results of a study carried out by gopikrishna , et al . on glass - ionomer - based adhesives ; in the case of complete setting reaction the bond strength was higher than that in incomplete setting reaction . \n contrary to the results of the present study , knight , et al . reported no statistically significant differences in the bond strength before and after initial setting of glass - ionomer in the co - cure technique , where conventional glass - ionomer , resin - modified glass - ionomer ( rmgi ) , and composite resin were placed in consecutive layers before light - curing procedure . \n the differences in the results of that study and the present study might be attributed to different etching times in the two studies . \n the etching time was 15 seconds in the present study , while in the study done by knight , et al . \n it appears that longer etching time paves the way for greater destruction of glass - ionomer surface by the acid and decreases the bond strength . \n in addition , a different technique was used in the above - mentioned study , i.e. , a layer of rmgi was used over conventional glass - ionomer before placement of composite resin and the curing process was carried out for rmgi and composite resin simultaneously . \n it is well - known that the ph of glass ionomer cements is strongly acidic upon mixing , and it will increase with time , with the most rapid increase during the first 5 - 10 minutes of setting , regardless of the composition of the glass ionomer material . in comparison of groups 2 and 3 , it appears that the acidic ph of unset glass - ionomer prevented complete polymerization of the giomer - based self - etch adhesive and therefore decrease the bond strength . \n in addition , this acidic ph might have an adverse effect on the polymerization of giomer itself . in a study carried out by mohamed - tahir , et al . \n another study has shown that surface hardness of composite resin placed on polyalkenoate glass ( set for 4 minutes ) significantly decreased . moreover , \n sem observation of the interface in group 3 revealed an inhomogeneous structure and occasionally breakdown of the glass - ionomer surface , which may have affected the bond strength . \n polyacrylic acid prevents polymerization of composite resin and results in composite resin softening ; apparently this effect was intensified in incompletely set glass - ionomer . in comparison of groups 1 and 2 \n , it appears that etching the glass - ionomer surface immediately after the initial setting in group 1 in the total - etch system resulted in the destruction of cement surface , crack formation and decrease in bond strength . \n this speculation was confirmed by the sem micrographs of the interface . the irregular interface in group 1 may be an indication of damage and weakening of the glass ionomer surface rather than improved micromechanical interlocking , when compared to group 2 which was treated by a comparatively mild acid , i.e. , the self - etching primer . \n several studies have demonstrated a decrease in bond strength of glass - ionomer to composite resin as a result of etching the glass - ionomer surface . \n it has been reported that etching during the initial setting reaction of glass - ionomer leads to dissolution of weak calcium - polyacrylate rings , with the resultant deterioration of its physical properties . in the total - etch procedure \n however , another reason for a higher bond strength in the self - etch group compared to the total - etch group is the fact that the acidic monomers in the self - etch primer can chemically bond to the calcium in glass - ionomer and increase bond strength . \n in addition , a more appropriate compatibility of giomer with the giomer - based self - etch adhesive might be another reason for a higher bond strength in group 2 ; it has been suggested that the use of adhesives compatible with resin - based restorative materials can decrease deleterious chemical interferences . \n moreover in the self - etch adhesive group , resin penetration occurs simultaneous with the etching process and it is probable that the discrepancy between these two processes is eliminated or minimized . \n another factor that needs to be taken into account is the difference in composition and mechanical properties of the two adhesives ; fl - bond ii is a two - step self - etching adhesive with filler particles while single bond is a mixture of hydrophilic monomers and solvents that contains no fillers . \n it has been suggested that the two - step self - etching adhesives that incorporate a hydrophobic resin as a separate bonding agent may have enhance mechanical properties compared to simplified adhesives . moreover , apart from the composition of resin matrix , addition of filler particles enhances the mechanical strength of the bonding layer and contributes to bond strength . in the present study \n , no differences were observed in bond strength between groups 1 and 3 , and bond strength in both groups was significantly less than that in group 2 . \n regarding failure mode in the present study , the majority of failures were of the cohesive type in glass - ionomer , which is consistent with previous studies . \n this phenomenon might be attributed to lower mechanical properties of glass ionomer cements when compared to resin - based materials and the presence of numerous air inclusion bodies inside glass - ionomer , which act as stress concentration points and probably increase the odds of cohesive failure . \n a disadvantage of sandwich technique is the absence of a chemical bond between conventional glass - ionomer and superficial resin materials ; therefore , researchers have focused on the establishment of a chemical bond between them . \n considering the results of the present study , use of giomer - based self - etch systems not only decreases the time needed for the clinical application but also can result in the establishment of a chemical bond between giomer and conventional glass - ionomer . \n taking into account the limitation of this in vitro study , etching the surface of set glass - ionomer with a total - etch system or placement of self - etch adhesive on the surface of glass - ionomer with incomplete initial setting compromised bonding of giomer to glass - ionomer .",

McGinn, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney. The procedure, performed at George Washington University, was scheduled after an annual physical in June showed that the battery in Mr. Cheney\u2019s device had reached the level where replacement is recommended.\n\nMr. Cheney was sedated for the procedure, which was performed Saturday morning, officials said. He walked out of the clinic at midday, returned home \u201cand resumed his normal schedule,\u201d Ms. McGinn said.\n\nThe device, which was implanted in 2001, is called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. It can act as both a pacemaker and, if necessary, a defibrillator to shock the heart back into normal rhythm. Doctors did not replace the wires that run from the device into the heart.\n\nMr. Cheney, 66, has had four heart attacks, the first when he was 37 and the last on Nov. 22, 2000, amid the furor over the contested outcome of the presidential election. Mr. Cheney has also had quadruple heart bypass surgery and two angioplasties, procedures to clear blockages in the arteries.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: New Heart Device Installed in Cheney.
