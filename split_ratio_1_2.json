Amrhein, who opened his Pierogi Gallery in Williamsburg way back in 1994, is opening a massive new space, located in a former industrial boiler room, just a few blocks away this weekend (191 North 14th Street). Marina Cashdan asked Amrhein a few questions about opening the Boiler in the new art economy.\n\nIsn\u2019t it a pretty tough economic climate to open a new space?\n\nIt\u2019s a bit counterintuitive to open a space during this time. We had this idea in mind before the economy really crashed, and we decided to follow through with this because I just think it\u2019s the right initiative. And being out in Williamsburg, we have a little more leeway in terms of overhead.\n\nThree years ago, while the rest of the New York art world was moving to Chelsea, you decided to open the space in Leipzig, Germany. What\u2019s happening with the gallery in Leipzig?\n\nI\u2019m still excited about that space, but since last year \u2014 when the gas prices went up and shipping costs went up and the dollar plunged \u2014 it became a little bit more expensive to operate there. And also the attention in Berlin is so dramatic that a lot of people don\u2019t travel as much. So we\u2019re going to downsize that space. We\u2019re going to function out of Dogenhaus\u2019s gallery space with the flat files. We decided that we were going to focus our attention on Brooklyn again.\n\nTell us about the Boiler\u2019s inaugural show.\n\nThe opening will be three of our artists who do large-scale work. Our Bahamian artist Tavares Strachan will have four tons of ice from the arctic in a freezer, which is solar powered. He does it because it\u2019s exotic [to him] and it\u2019s all about displacement \u2014 the displacement that he had in his family coming through the slave trade to the Bahamas. The first time we showed it was in the Bahamas, and then in Miami, so it\u2019s been in deep freeze for two years in Miami (of all places) since that show. But the idea is to keep this ice alive because it\u2019s about the energy and politics of arctic ice that we\u2019re trying to keep it alive.\n\nHas it diminished at all since the first show?\n\nA little bit, but it\u2019s still alive \u2014 I say \u201calive\u201d like it\u2019s a living object \u2014 but it has that sort of idea that it\u2019s keeping the arctic alive and keeping global warming down.\n\nAnd what about the Jonathan Schipper and Yoon Lee works?\n\nJonathan Schipper\u2019s piece is a six-foot-diameter sphere with 215 points of view. It\u2019s 215 monitors with cameras on a transparent sphere, which is quite a beautiful sculpture. It\u2019s going to be suspended, so it will have magical qualities. And then the painter Yoon Lee from San Francisco, she loves to work in large scale so we\u2019re going to show a 20-foot painting [of hers]. That\u2019s what the idea of the space is all about: to show these ambitious pieces by the artists.\n\nWhat do the neighbors think of your new space? It\u2019s a pretty industrial part of Williamsburg.\n\nThis is the old Williamsburg. This is the part I like. They still have the rough streets and much more sense of possibility. I think the space will revitalize the neighborhood.",
